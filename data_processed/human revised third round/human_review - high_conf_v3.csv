6,230,230,"Hi everyone,

My wife gave birth to our beautiful baby boy at 5 days ago. The first nights were tough - baby has colic and my wife was exhausted. I stayed up all night and helped as best as I could - she did manage to get some sleep I believe. 

She has been emotionally drained however and I completely understand. I am a foreigner and we live in her country of origin and I speak the language only superficially, meaning that unfortunately the weight of the bureaucracy has fallen on her. I’ve helped by cooking meals and doing most house chores - cleaning, arranging as well as driving us around to appointments.

This afternoon something happened and my wife caught me absentmindedly eating a booger. Her mood changed in an instant. She became confrontational and irritated straight away. She told me I disgust her and that she doesn’t want me around nor want to sleep with me. 

I tried talking to her later. I was keeping the baby for an hour while she was showering. She came back to the room and asked me to leave or she would. I told her this was still our bed but if that meant she wouldn’t get enough sleep I’d leave her space.

I sent her a phone message later saying I love you and hope you have a goodnight sleep. And she replied with: “think about where do you want to take this relationship, because I honestly can’t imagine anything to do with you in terms of being your wife”. I asked her what did she mean by that and she replied that it’s very straightforward, she cannot see herself as my wife anymore, and she’s considering moving to her parents house or finding another arrangement. 

She said “I had never imagined this happening to this relationship but I guess it was due.”

I’m trying to calm myself down but I’m in the middle of a panic attack. As is she. I’m not sure this may be Postpartum rage or postpartum depression, but in case it is I want to support my wife through this dark forest. I’m open to any suggestions.

Thank you.",,"hi everyone

10,274,274,"I was diagnosed with postpartum depression when baby was around 10-12 weeks old.
She spent the first six weeks of her in hospital while having open heart surgery at two weeks old.

I had to give birth in another city and spent 9 weeks away from my three year old. I saw him once in that time. I really really struggled being away from home and my son. I struggled with the isolation of the hospital environment. Thankfully my husband was with me most of the time except for when I was rooming in with bubs. 

Looking back I think the PND started during pregnancy after the heart condition was detected at the anatomy scan. It was a stressful pregnancy mentally and being my third pregnant it really took a toll on my body so it was hard physically. 

I also have unresolved grief and emotions surrounding my first baby who was stillborn.

So, it's not really surprising that I'm struggling with motherhood this time around. I am angry ALL the time. I rage out often. I'm a shitty person to be around.

13,298,298,"Hello,

I'm a mom of a toddler and a newborn, and I’m hoping to find some solidarity here. My situation seems a bit different from what I often read about—my toddler has been downright mean and distant towards me since our newborn came home. I know the more common challenge is toddlers being aggressive toward the new baby, but my toddler’s aggression is all directed at me. He isn’t acting out toward the baby or his dad—just me.

I’m a stay-at-home mom and was with him 24/7 before the baby arrived. He always favored me and would only want me for everything—whether it was getting a snack or being taken out of his highchair, it was always ""Mommy."" Since the baby came, though, he acts like I’m invisible. He screams “no” at me, won’t make eye contact, hits me, and just seems to want nothing to do with me.

I’m breastfeeding, and my newborn cluster feeds a lot, so she’s on me constantly. As a result, my husband has taken over a lot of the toddler duties, and I’m still recovering from a C-section. I’ve been doing everything I can think of to make my toddler feel special—scheduling one-on-one time with him every day, involving him in helping with the baby, explaining what’s going on, and trying to reassure him. But nothing seems to be working. 

I know this is likely his way of processing the change, and I understand he’s hurt, but it still hurts me deeply. I’m trying to stay strong in front of him, but it’s really hard. It feels so isolating, and I just need to hear from anyone who’s been through this. I feel like I'm the only one experiencing this, and the emotional toll is tough—especially with postpartum feelings in the mix.

Please, no negative comments. I’m already struggling, and I could really use some support from others who’ve been through something similar.

Thank you.",,"hello

15,323,323,"I'm 2 months postpartum and I have been diagnosed with postpartum depression. Around 2 weeks after the baby was born, I started to feel a sense of dread every morning and not want to get out of bed. I started to get more anxious and small things were setting me off.

My baby got sick and was admitted to hospital for around 10 days. During this time, I was in the hospital with him and lost interest in eating, personal hygiene became difficult. Everything seemed too difficult, although I was getting more rest in the hospital than I would at home and I only had to feed and change my baby. 

I went into emergency at the same hospital and they diagnosed me with postpartum depression, but I keep feeling like it is not that. After coming home from the hospital, I had a burst of energy and got quite a lot done but I still wasn't interested in eating and personal hygiene was still difficult despite being at home. Whenever the baby cried, I would start shaking and just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. 

Everything feels like there are too many steps and it's too difficult. I have had postpartum depression and anxiety before and it was really bad, but I didn't feel this sense of confusion and slowness that I do this time. 

I haven't cooked in ages, whenever I go into the kitchen I start to feel scared and sometimes my hands shake whenever I'm faced with a task I need to do. I don't want to get out of bed in the mornings. I feel like I can't take on any new task, I can only repeat the things I know from before and a lot of those I can't do anymore. I'm anxious about ordering groceries because I will have to put them away. I'm anxious about putting food into a plate and eating it. When I'm given a plate of food, it feels too difficult to even sit and eat. I'm anxious about ordering diapers and baby clothes and formula. It all feels mentally taxing and draining and I can't explain that to anyone because they would think I'm crazy. I only look forward to sleeping because there's nothing to think about, but once I wake up it all starts again. 

Today my daughter had an accident in the washroom and my hands started shaking, I felt scared and genuinely felt like I did not want to live life anymore. It felt so difficult and I don't know why. 

My ferritin levels were low prior to my c section, but I checked recently and it is now in the fifties. I have been at 7 during pregnancy and I didn't feel this way. 

I feel isolated from everyone and I wonder how people can enjoy anything. I don't enjoy spending time with my kids or anyone else, I don't have much to say and prefer being alone. I feel so much sadness, as if I have lost everything and the person I was is gone. I find it difficult to move from one task to another and feel scared whenever I'm alone with my kids because I'll have to multi task and I can't seem to. I just want to run away from everything.

I was prescribed 50mg Zoloft and I am taking something for sleep too. I'm told the Zoloft hasn't kicked in yet and I have to wait until the two week mark.

I have read stories of postpartum depression and I don't see anybody struggling to function as much as I am right now.

I was so excited and happy for my baby to be here and now that she’s here I’m feeling the complete opposite. I love her so much but I also miss my old life and the way everything was before. I have so much anxiety and depression right now that it’s not allowing me to live in the moment and enjoy my baby as a newborn. The anxiety is so bad that I have no motivation to do anything when I used to love cleaning and doing things around the house. We have a two story house where the master is the only room downstairs and the rest are upstairs, so I never really went upstairs. Since my baby is still very little she’s gonna be downstairs with us until she’s big enough to go in her own room up there which won’t be for a while, but I feel like now I have a whole nother house to clean since l never had to worry about the upstairs.

Our relationship has been nothing short of legendary. I have never felt a love like I have with him. (We’ve been together for 7 years married for almost 2.) 
After having our baby and him going back to work things have changed drastically. He doesn’t even know if he wants to be in this marriage anymore. I asked him on a scale of 1-10 if he wanted to save this marriage he said 5. He is a completely different person, it is so hard to accept and to even see him that way. I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone. This has been going on for a couple months now, he just keeps saying he doesn’t know what he wants. It is torture living in this house with him because I love him SO much and he literally doesn’t want to touch me, kiss me, barley will even say “I love you” and treats me like a friend. It’s excruciatingly painful I don’t even know what to do with myself. I know people say things get really rough in the first year of parenthood but this seems like more than that.. I’ve looked through his phone (which I’ve never done before this) multiple times and have found absolutely nothing, not even him liking girls photos so I don’t think he is being disloyal. What am I supposed to do? Do I give him space and let him heal whatever he needs to heal? Am I being neglected? Do I keep fighting to save us? I am so lost. I can’t even imagine a world in which we are not together but he seems like the only thing holding him back from wanting a divorce is our son. 


For more context, he works a VERY demanding job and I stay home. Staying home has been a huge transition for me as I went from making 6 figures to being a stay at home mom and not making my own money. I understand his job is really demanding physically and mentally, I really feel for him in that aspect. I have also been struggling though and have let my postpartum rage get the best of me at times and this is where this all started. There is so much distance between us now because neither of our needs are getting met. He said “if I really wanted to save this marriage I don’t think it would be hard but I just don’t know if I want that yet.” So what am I supposed to do? Wait around for him? I mean after all this is a marriage and I feel like fighting for it and white knuckling through it is what you’re supposed to do right? He isn’t mean to me, he’s very respectful and is still there for me but.. am I being a fool? Should I just call the marriage?

I’m a FTM to a 9mo and my best friend is also a FTM to a 7mo, but our PP journeys have been very different, her baby was a lot more demanding while I had it easier. 
Recently she has changed her behaviour a lot, not picking up the phone, not returning messages/ calls, avoiding meeting up, not even responding in group chats she was very active previously. I suspect that she might be avoiding me because I have a considerably easier time with baby, and there might be some subconscious resentment.
Obviously I understand life changes after having a baby, but I’m a bit worried about her and suspect that she may be experiencing PPD. She’s trying to make everyone believe her life is amazing and she loves life with her baby girl, so on the few occasions I’ve tried to ask if she’s okay she gives a vague answer and never really shares anything but I can see she’s not as happy as she presents.
Which comes to the point, what can I do to support her? I want her to know she is loved and supported whatever she’s going through but I don’t know how to “reach her” anymore.

He’s always asking “why are you in a bad mood” if I happen to snap or act short tempered.

43,511,511,"I just found out that in 1925, my great grandmother developed a severe case of PPD (wasn't called that then, but that's what it was.) Due to the lack of mental health resources at the time, she was committed to an asylum and died several months later due to ""loss of flesh"" (starvation, as she had lost the desire to eat.) My grandfather's only memory of his mother was of her being taken away, and being told that it was because she didn't love him and his brother enough. 

PPD has not gotten any easier in the last 100 years. It's still a mindfuck, it still makes you feel so isolated and alone, and there's still a stigma. But as I go through PPD/A again, and now have heard this story, I wanted to say how grateful I am to live during a time where there's therapy, medication, support groups, and above all a basic understanding and sense of compassion. I've never thought about the women who came before us, who laid the groundwork for the maternal mental healthcare we have today but in this moment I am eternally grateful that I can help manage my symptoms with modern medicine and therapy.

44,512,512,"So I'm trying to navigate being 4 months postpartum and having to go back to work a month early. My gynecologist has been dismissive of everything. 

Childbirth was hard on me. It's my first child and my gynecologist was dismissive of all my worries. High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes run in my family her response was I'm fine I don't have anything to worry about. I was extremely dehydrated no matter how much I drank so my primary ran test and said I was pre-diabetic and to monitor my glucose because it was high. Feet were swelling bad on top of it. But she still insisted I was fine. He wasn't a big baby 8 lbs 11 oz. I was worried because both my sisters had huge babies and had to have c-sections. Again all I got told was oh doesn't mean I will. 

I had a natural birth but suffered tearing. Not sure if it's normal but she didn't tell me I had second degree tearing and had stitches. I was also running a fever due to covid during my labor so I wasn't able to have my support system outside of my husband. Who while I love, kept off to the side worried about being in the way. All I got told for my after care was don't wipe or use soap. Had to Google for how long and tiktok was basically how I knew what to look out for and what to do to help ease the pain. 

I spent my first two weeks in tears because of the pain and being unable to get to the baby or hold him. I'm still having pain 4 months later. My lower abdomen and hips are still hurting. Mainly getting up from sitting or off the bed can be extremely hard on me and hurts. Sometimes I have to hold the table or the wall. And now I'm back to work it's increased and someone else has to move the baby around for me at the end of the day. At my 8 week follow up she said i was healing fine and had extra scarring (???). And claimed the lower abdomen pain was my period coming back. Mind you yes I've had my period last month but the cramps were different than the pain I was feeling. My anxiety was also high once again and she did prescribe me a low dosage of my former medication.

Once again it was my primary who ran test and referred me to a different gynecologist at this point. I still haven't been able to speak with a therapist and won't for another 2 weeks. I'm told this could be PCOS, which I had and had to get on metformin to get pregnant, and or endometriosis. I had to go back to work due to my paid family leave running out and it barely covered my bills as is and had been putting my health insurance on my credit card.

My anxiety has increased even more. I'm starting to feel stressed from everything due to the gynecologist. I'm depressed from feeling like I'm drowning. My husband tries his best and we have my parents but I'm overwhelmed. Sometimes the baby crying triggers me but I don't want him to be away from me. I can't even go back on disability because I can't afford to keep putting my insurance on the credit card ($550 a month, me & baby). I did get medi-cal but have had 0 luck getting ahold of those doctors. Call goes straight to voicemail that literally only has the generic voicemail and doesn't even say it's a doctors office. No call backs so I don't even feel like I have that for a fall back.

I do see the gynecologist my primary recommended this week but it's stressing me even more. I'm worried I'll be told I should go back on disability due to my pains. It's visible on my face and in the way I walk. I also got recommended to a endocrinologist but his office is busy and has yet to return any of my calls and that online booking also says unable to.

I just feel like I have no help. No time to breathe. Especially now back to work. And I feel like a failure because I can't always hold my baby or soothe him when he's crying. I worry I'm going to drop him due to the issues. I'm bottling everything in because I know my husband tries and does a lot. I don't want him to feel bad. But I don't know what to do. I have no idea how to navigate this and motherhood.

47,548,548,"My daughter is 4 months old, and I feel like an absolute disaster. Before she was born, I was fiercely independent and a workaholic. My husband and I have been working together for the past seven years.

My pregnancy was unintentional, but it went smoothly. We live with my widowed MIL, who has always been difficult. She says the most hurtful and insensitive things, but I used to manage by retreating to my room for personal space. Even after all these years, I’ve never felt like this house is mine. I tiptoe around her—not because I fear her, but because I dread her comments that hurt me deeply.

She doesn’t let me cook and babies my husband like he’s a child. She constantly tries to prove she’s closer to him than I am, saying things like, “He held my hand when we went to [so-and-so place].” My husband never sees a problem with her behavior and always asks me to tolerate her because she’s a widow.

Everything changed after I became a mother.

When my daughter was born, my MIL became possessive to an extreme. At the hospital, she didn’t let my mother hold the baby. She took over feeding her formula and cleaning her, even though I was breastfeeding. Later, she told my SIL in front of everyone, “She already had the best time with her daughter while feeding her for two days.” It broke me—why does she feel the need to take over and act like she’s the mother?

At home, her constant advice and interference completely drain me. She calls my daughter her child and keeps emphasizing that the baby looks like my husband or my SIL. It’s like she’s trying to erase me.

She even told me, “Your daughter loves you now because you’re feeding her. Later, you won’t need to worry because I’ll cook for her, and she’ll forget you.” I want to cook for my daughter—I need to. But she controls the kitchen and creates a scene whenever I cook. Still, I’ve started asserting myself and cooking anyway.

I took a therapy session where the therapist suggested I should appreciate the help. But why can’t I have the freedom to raise my daughter the way I want? Why can’t I decide what’s best for her? I’m constantly anxious about the future—what if my MIL starts dominating me even more when it comes to feeding or other decisions?

I hate conflict, but I have to face her every day. She’s intruding on my life, and I feel like I’m suffocating. Every day feels heavier than the last. I wake up gripped by dread and anxiety.

I’ve also become very possessive of my daughter. I hate it when others, especially my MIL, spend time with her. I fear that my daughter won’t recognise me as her mother or won’t care about me. I know some of these thoughts are irrational, but I can’t help it.

I come from a small family and am extremely close to my parents. I don’t have many friends, so this situation feels even more isolating.

I don’t know what to do. How do I handle all of this? How can I make myself feel better?",,"daughter month old feel like absolute disaster bear fiercely independent workaholic husband work together past seven year

Dad of 2 kids. Most of my friends don't have kids so I’m reaching out here because I start to struggle to keep things together, and I’m hoping some of you may have advice or words of encouragement to share.

My wife recently started experiencing a sudden onset of tinnitus, and it's been a nightmare for her. We’re about 3 months postpartum with our second child, and she’s barely able to get any sleep because of this relentless ringing in her ears. This is all so unexpected. When we had our first, she never had to worry about getting up at night; I took over all the nighttime feedings to help her body and mind recover. It worked well that time around, and we figured the same approach would help us get through this second postpartum phase.

But now, the tinnitus has changed everything. My wife is absolutely exhausted—physically and emotionally. She’s at a breaking point and spends a lot of time crying and hiding away in the bathroom. She's been passing out majority of the days from sheer exhaustion. She’s in such a rough place, and it’s heartbreaking to watch her go through this without being able to make it better. It's also hard in Canada to get access to medical professionals or have them to take you seriously when the symptoms are not life threatening to them. 

Our 2.5-year-old is extremely attached to me because I have been her primary caregiver since birth, so balancing time with them while also caring for the baby is a huge challenge. I recently returned to work from paternity leave and am working from home, but I’m caught between meetings and taking care of the baby. It’s constant juggling, and it feels like I can’t catch a break or truly be present for either kid.

If anyone has experienced postpartum tinnitus or has suggestions on how to get through this rough patch, please let me know. And if nothing else, please send good vibes our way. We could use them right now.

Thanks for listening.",,"hey everyone

71,749,749,"This last week has been tough. I switched meds and they had some serious side effects: suicide ideation. I made a list of my belongings and what should be done with them upon my passing. I haven’t told my husband this but we did have a talk about going to an emergency room if I felt I needed it. That the kids would be ok at the house and we would sort things out. 
On Tuesday The kids ate a whole box of Nilla Wafers I bought for them on Sunday. I was so mad so I”quit” being a mom. I told them I am not cooking or cleaning or parenting any of them for a while. I have older girls so they have been taking care of things. My husband is out of town. He is working through his own hardships and is trying to get us more financially stable. 

He sent me a reel last night about a lady who said she was trying to do everything ie feminism and live up to the hype of social media. She said she “thinks” men want a nurturing partner to produce offspring and create a peaceful home. 
So I asked him why he married me and he can’t give me an answer that isn’t tied to me being a mother. I kept asking and he said it was because I was kind and loving and wanted to improve myself as a person. He also commented on my looks quoting the Song of Solomon. 
So I told him that I guess I am looking for a specific answer that he can’t give me. Other than I’m “nice and kind”. That just affirmations to me that I am not “special” or “unique” in any way. He could meet up with any number of women and determine they are nice and kind and want to improve themselves. His answer just affirms to me that I am replaceable and he can find happiness with someone else who is not me. Someone who is smarter, prettier, funny, and better at everything else. 

Tell me I am not wrong for wanting a better answer than just he likes me for “being giving and helping other people”. 
What kind of an answer is that? I know I’m not the prettiest and my body isn’t what it used to be. I have lots of grey hair that has appeared within the last year. My face is tired and saggy.

72,758,758,"So to start with some context, I have recently diagnosed audhd and I have had depression and anxiety from a very young age. I've gotten that under control with the right medications and therapy, but not without a handful of bumps along the way. I am so lucky to be married to my best friend and to be starting a family with him. He is kind and patient and funny and just the best I could've ever asked for.

I have had some turmoil with my in-laws within the last 5 years or so that began when we overheard my (now) husband's mother scream crying that she didn't want him to marry me a few months into our engagement. (Now I know I'm not nearly as wonderful as my husband; I am tarnished with childhood trauma and I'm working hard to prevent spreading any of it to my son.) But she was a big part of my childhood (my husband and I were neighbors and good friends growing up), and I looked to her for wisdom and advice and she was a real inspiration to me. When she let out her true feelings that she didn't like me, my world shattered and I instantly threw up invisible barriers to protect myself. So we act totally fine and catch up like all is well when we see eachother, but I can only handle seeing the in-laws maybe 2 times a month. By the end of each get together I am drained of all emotional energy. They are inherently good people, but they are in their own little bubble they've established, with very few friends or family involved in their lives. It's hard to be one of the few people they have around, especially since my husbands brother moved across country last year. It feels like they're more reliant on us to fill that gap wince they're empty nesters now. When we slowly started to come over less, they seemed mostly fine with that, and the relationship with them felt much less rocky.

I just gave birth to our beautiful boy last week and I have never been more happy in my life. Truly, I have never loved my husband more than when I see him being a daddy. I have never felt more purpose and contentment with my life. 

However, the second our baby was born, my MIL has swept in to try to be with us as often as she can. It is my biggest pet peeve when someone tiptoes around their real intentions as if I'm dumb or complacent. My MIL is insisting on coming by everyday to drop off something to ""help"" us with. That sounds like the right thing that people should do for new parents, sure, and I'd love it if she'd been this way the last 5 years. But she has shown time and time again that she doesn't like me for her son and thus, this ""help"" feels transactional and wrong. I'd even let that go if she hadn't already blatantly disrespected us and our boundaries with the baby.

It's often debated what boundaries parents set, and if they're reasonable or not. I made it clear throughout this pregnancy 1:do not kiss the baby by any means and dont put your hands on his face 2:do not invite yourself or others over.

My in-laws kissed my son at least 30 times and when confronted said ""oh we agree babies shouldn't be kissed on the face, but we just did the top of his head"". Then I was told she invited aunts and other people to come see ""her baby"".
Now I respect that she's his grandmother and she has every right to be excited and to love him. 
I've been emotional as hell since this boy was born and it is almost all joy. But then the stress of having to set boundaries with this difficult person that I can never fully cut off has put me into a spiral. Every time she messages I feel my chest swell with anxiety and anger and I end up sobbing uncontrollably and screaming like a banshee at how mad I am at her. I then cry from how guilty I feel for being so upset when this should be the happiest time of my life. My husband has been the perfect dad and spouse and I've been making things so difficult but I can't control my emotions. My baby's eyes and my husband's hugs bring me back to earth but having a newborn is already hard on a relationship. I don't want to also have to be the bad guy with my MIL because ultimately, while I'd rather not have her in my life, she is my love's mother and I do respect that bond.

I am sleep deprived and my body doesn't feel like my own. I don't feel like myself and I miss who I was pre-pregnancy. But I'm also so in love with being a mom. It's an absolute Rollercoaster. I'm joining a post-partum program soon, but I'm afraid a great deal of healing will only be able to be done if I confront my trauma and issues with my MIL. I'm going to offend her and probably mess things up for a little while but for my own sanity I think these feelings need to be addressed with the source.

That was a lot but I needed to sort out my thoughts and vent. I already feel a little better now, whether or not anyone responds to this.

Thoughts? I'm not opposed to hearing that I'm a pos daughter-in-law because I have considered that theory as well. I just love my little family so much and I want to keep all negativity put of this bubble that we're forming while we adjust to our new lives together.

73,764,764,"I am almost certain wife has PPA/PPR but she refuses to look into it or even read the descriptions of it I send her. It is our first LO. She insists she is the same person she was before, but she isn't. She's cold, cruel or indifferent to me (though she's slightly improved on this--from 100% cruel in all situations to being cruel only once a day but otherwise mostly indifferent--she did this, though, only after I gave her a mandate and deadline to stop screaming at me for leaving the microwave door ajar). I want to forgive her, but she gaslights me when I mention that her behavior is wrong and I can see in her body language that she still feels rage to me. (This from a woman who told me women use period pain as an excuse for their character flaws / bad behavior). 

I try to be positive and help her recover. Her mom babysat for an hour with pumped milk and we went to have a meal at her favorite cafe. 75% of the time she was on her phone looking for items for the baby. She buys countless things that even the doctors have told us we do not need (e.g. a billerubin test device even though baby is now at almost normal levels and the doctors say it will resolve in a day or two). In the first few days, she cost us thousands of dollars by running overdrafts without moving some money from savings and I can only alleviate this by hourly checking that she hasn't spent another $500 on something and overdrafted (I mentioned it to her and she says it's my responsibility but i cant press because she cant take it right now) meanwhile I am the real villain for forgetting to take out the trash. 

I'm up with the baby at night with her to burp baby, but she refuses to bottle feed so neither of us get significant sleep. (I also cook breakfast and clean and do diaper duty). She refuses to acknowledge the liberties her mom takes in our home (while MIL is also helping) and screams at me if I try to set healthy boundaries for MIL--such as not barging in unannounced while I am naked.

Ladies: what did your husband do to help pull you out of this cycle? I sat her down to watch her favorite comedy TV show yesterday while the baby was feeding and she couldn't even recall what the 20 minute episode was about because the whole time she was reading something about the best soaps to buy for baby (we already have 5+ designer soaps for babies and the doctor said there's nothing wrong with her skin and to keep using what we're using but just to wash with soap once or at most twice a week).

I'm thinking we can have a five minute dance off or something, but I've got to pull her up and out of this because she is destroying herself and our relationship too and I can't take this too much longer. I read somewhere that mental illness explains behavior, but it doesn't excuse it and there are / should be consequences. 

My latest idea is to try to get her to dance for 5 minutes...silly but I'm trying everything.",,"almost certain wife ppappr refuse look even read description send first lo insist person not cold cruel indifferent though slightly improve thisfrom cruel situation cruel day otherwise mostly indifferentshe though give mandate deadline stop scream leave microwave door ajar want forgive gaslight mention behavior wrong see body language still feel rage woman tell woman use period pain excuse character flaw bad behavior

74,791,791,"I’m 26. I have a 3 year old, 2 year old, and 5 month old. I have a great husband who tries his best to help me, but he works more than full time and I’m a SAHM. I’m tired. I’m so tired. Anytime I tell people that they say “well yeah, you’ve got three babies”. Thanks, not helpful. But..it’s like my soul is tired. I get plenty of sleep for the most part. But down to my bones I’m just..tired. Burnt out I guess. Tired of feeling unheard. My toddlers don’t listen to a word I say. “They’re toddlers”. Yeah, I know, thank you, but they LITERALLY don’t listen to a word I say. Something has got to change. They listen to their dad. He comes home and all I want to do is be listened to. Tell a story where he’s engaged, making eye contact, not changing the subject or saying “haha look at the baby” when I’m mid sentence. My kids don’t listen, he doesn’t listen. I stop talking mid sentence sometimes to see if anyone notices and they never do. I do so much for them, and I know if I died tomorrow, I’d be missed, but right now, it feels like everyone would just miss having clean clothes and food. My husband has to work a lot. Because We have three babies. And I can’t complain, because we’ve been blessed with three healthy babies that I’m able to stay home with. I can’t complain. Everyone tells me “you’re so blessed”. I know I’m blessed. I feel blessed. But I feel empty a lot of the time too. I cry so much more than I used to. I love my kids so so so much. But I feel like I’m just a vessel holding love for them. I’m nothing else. The old me is gone and I can’t find her anywhere. I have hobbies but little time to do them. I know this is just a season of life. My rational brain knows that. “These are the good old days”, “don’t wish their lives away”, “some day you’ll miss the fingerprints on everything”. I know. And part of the reason I cry all the time is the guilt I feel about that. I love them. But I’m so tired. But to wake up every day to the same stuff “no don’t touch that”, “don’t hit your brother”, “please don’t wake the baby”.. I’m so tired. I’ve never tried therapy but I feel like I need to. Something just doesn’t feel right. I’ve lost myself sometime in these past 3 years and every now and then I’ll get a glimpse my old self, but I can never get ahold of her for any significant period of time. I can’t afford therapy and insurance likely won’t cover it. Waiting to see if it’s approved so fingers crossed. I don’t want medication. I just need someone to listen to me. Even if they have to be paid to do it. I need confirmation that I’m not just a ghost, I do really exist and people can hear me. I’m also anxious, overstimulated, my needs are rarely met, and then, after a long hard day, I’m laying in bed and I get the tap on my shoulder from my husband. But my sex drive is absolutely gone has been since baby #1. “That’s normal, you have 3 babies”. I would love to feel normal again. But I don’t remember what normal feels like. 
And I would never hurt myself or my kids. Never. They’re my whole heart. But I’m at my lowest right now.

83,890,890,"I have a history of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, and pretty sure undiagnosed issues as well) and having my baby has made it so hard to cope. I feel like so many days are just me fighting for my life. 

So back in February 2023 I got out of a longterm 4 year relationship (that's longterm for me atleast) and a few weeks after the breakup I started talking to who is now my current bf (we did used to talk back in like 2017, so he wasnt a complete stranger). My last relationship wasn't healthy on both sides and me and my ex really hurt each other so I don't think I ever gave myself anytime to actually heal, just jumped into the next relationship. My bf and I started dating March 2023 and actually got pregnant that same month. So as you can imagine everything's moving pretty fast. Well I also lost my job of 3 years, got evicted, been playing catchup with carpayments, lost another job and just keep on getting slapped in the face with lots of struggles. 

I could feel the depression, anxiety, and rage creeping in during pregnancy but tried my best to ignore it. I did pretty well keeping a smile on the outside while I was going through a lot in my mind and physically. 

Fast forward beginning of this year I gave birth to my beautiful sweet baby. My daughter had horrible colic up until around 4.5 or 5 months. It was the worse, no matter what i did she just would keep crying and crying. Sleep deprivation plus and crying baby does not mix well for an already mentally ill person. My bf was working a lot around the time (working during holidays in retail he was pretty drained). So when I gave birth he tried his best to be present but he was so tired it didn't feel like he was as present as he could be, or maybe he was and I just needed extra help. Not even a full 2 months into being postpartum bfs mom and I had an argument and currently 7 months and counting later his whole side of the family still won't talk to us. I have a very small family so I only have my mom and dad (they're separated so it's either one or the other). 

About 3 months pp I went back to work and have been struggling to make it on time, I'm late every single day. I call in. I bs everytime I'm there. I get overwhelmed so incredibly easy. Thankfully I'm part-time and only work about 5 hour shifts a few days a week, but they're killing me. It doesn't help that I had to go to early mornings shifts. Waking up for for at 5-6am when I go to sleep at 12-2am nearly everynight is not for the weak. 

We even have lots of financial issues going on, we had our electricity turned off 2 different times this year. 

I don't mean to get into full detail about everything but I just needed you guys to understand the amount of stress's and change is just getting to me. My life has completely changed since last year and I have no idea who I am. I can't work on any hobbies of mine bc they require me to be focused and it's hard to do that with a 9 month. I'm constantly fearing of losing my job bc I can't get my shit together. I can't never keep the house in order and it's always either messy or needing something to do. I don't even do makeup anymore and I used to do it daily. I don't do anything for myself and I'm having a hard time doing things for my family. I feel so lost. 

I love my baby so much but I never imagined having a baby honestly, especially this early in life. I feel so stupid for how things turned out. I try my best to be patient but sometimes I have the worse breakdowns. Lastnight I couldn't stop crying and screaming bc I just wanted to make some food and my daughter was tired but fighting her sleep really hard. It was so tough and I was all on my own. (Bf works until like 11pm-12:30am so I'm literally all alone). 

Some days are so easy to control my emotions. I really do feel like the best mom ever and I'm so proud of myself but lately ive been in a slump and I get easily triggered by my bf, baby, cats, work, literally anything and everything. I kind of have friends but if I'm honestly speaking they're just old high-school/old work friends. I never really used to hang with them much outside of those places. My past relationship kept me from being to close to anyone so I pushed my many ppl out of my life. I don't have anyone that close to me. Sure I have some people that I know if I reached out to they could be there for me and actually understand what I'm going through but I just feel disconnected from everyone. 

I'm not sure the point of me writing this, it's just been a lot and I want to feel heard and seen. I'm sure it'll get better eventually but I don't know how much more stress I can take. I feel like a horrible mom a lot of the time. it's just ne and my bf for the most part, occasionally I have my mom's help but she's getting older and has health problems so she can't always help out as much as she's like to. 

 Disclaimer: my bf treats me really well and he always tries his best to help me feel better and take over when he's home, but I know deep down he's struggling too. Especially since his whole family are basically disowning him atp.

I hate that I feel like I don’t want anything to do with her (she wasn’t planned but we planned it anyway because I felt like I had to keep her regardless of my feelings; she was a surprise baby) I hate that I resent her because of all the trauma I went through when I gave birth and when I was abused by my ex spouse who is also a narcissist. It’s like trauma on top of trauma for six years and it fucking hurts.

87,936,936,"This is something that has bugged me for ALONG time and I am wondering if anyone else has these thoughts of if I just have some weird attachment issues. It is causing a lot of my PPD issues because I am blaming the girls for ""ruining my life"".

Backstory: I met my fiancé when I was 26 and he was 27. Before I met him I was in a relationship with a man twice my age, who was very boring so I did not do typical ""20 year old things"". I worked 2 jobs and then sat around the house when I wasn't working. My now husband on the other hand was very adventurous during that time, had/has a huge friend group who was always together, partied, took trips and just had a lot of fun.

I met my husband and finally had SO much fun. I fit right into the friend group and we were always together and having the best times. I was so happy I finally had found my best friend who I loved doing life with. The man of my dreams. Our relationship moved fast and we got engaged 10 months into our relationship and started wedding planning. We were supposed to be married this past June, however we unexpectedly ended up getting pregnant and had to push the wedding back (was due a week after our set date). We ended up going to the courthouse for insurance reasons and got married and just had our twin girls 2 months ago. He is an amazing father and even better husband, all 3 of us girls are truly blessed. It is a love I have never known and feel so lucky to have him.

That being said...even before our girls were born I really struggled with the fact that I wish I had met him sooner. I feel myself almost get angry and resentful that I did not get that pre-kid, teen, 20's time with him. I got a taste of it for 2 years and it was the best 2 years of my life. I know how much fun life could have been during that younger time with him. Him and his friend group talk about all the ""wild"" times they had together and I just wish I could have been there with him. Then we had the girls and it really felt like the nail in the coffin. Like that I am officially ""old and boring"" and even further proves that I will never have that stage of life with him. Which is silly because we still do SO much (we are blessed with a lot of support for our girls from friends and family) and I have the rest of my life with him. Like we just sat at our friends house last night for a bonfire and drinks with the girls with us and had a fun night. I just for some reason cannot shake the anger, sadness and longing for more of those younger years with him. I find myself crying on almost a daily basis because I just long for something I will never have and don't know how to accept that. It makes me have awful thoughts about my girls, like this is somehow their fault and makes me not want them. Like stuck in the ""what if""...what would life look like if we didn't have them. Would I be happier? I tourture myself with these thoughts. Maybe this is a co-dependency/attachment issue? Has anyone else felt like this?",,"something bug along time wonder anyone else thought weird attachment issue cause lot ppd issue blame girl ruin life
