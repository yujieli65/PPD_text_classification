209,209,"I'll start with a little background for context. I have always dealt with some degree of anxiety (and perhaps depression) for years, often leading to bouts of insomnia before getting pregnant. The longest it would last would be maybe a month and simply just having difficulty getting to sleep. I had one week or two of insomnia while pregnant, but honestly was less anxious than usual. Flash forward to now, I'm 5 months pp and have been struggling to get a good nights rest for nearly 3 months, and (at least for the last 2 months) it's not the baby.



The first 10-12 weeks, yeah the baby made it difficult to get good rest. He was colicky and breastfeeding was going poorly. I transitioned to being an exclusive pumper and the schedule I was having to keep to try to increase my poor supply only served to mess with my sleep even more. I'd sleep fairly good for the first half of the night, but got to where when I woke up to pump in the middle of the night, I struggled to get back to sleep. I dropped the middle of the night pump early January and had initial improvement in my sleep. I'd still wake up before my alarm, only getting 1-2 hours more than I had been. Then I started having trouble getting to sleep and still waking up early. I started feeling anxious just looking at my bed. So I moved to the couch and it worked... for a bit. Then was the day I went 40 hours without sleep... I was in crisis mode and my primary doctor basically said ""sorry, can't help. Nothing we can prescribe you because you're breastfeeding."" Thankfully, my OB was able to see me and questioned if I'm depressed/anxious because I'm not sleeping or not sleeping because I'm depressed/anxious. Honestly, I don't know which came first at this point. 

  
She prescribed me Trazadone to help me sleep. And it did help. So did weaning from pumping. But my old friend insomnia still seems to be sticking around. If I don't take the Trazadone, it takes me forever to get to sleep and I still wake up early. I've been sick recently, so I've even paired it with NyQuil a few nights, which seems more effective but still not getting a full night of rest (NyQuil used to leave me drowsy the next day... apparently not anymore). Last night took me forever to get to sleep and I only slept maybe 4 hours before being woken by my husband's coughing. I just feel at a loss of what to do. I miss sleeping in bed, but just seeing it makes me anxious. The couch is making my body hurt and honestly probably contributing to my poor sleep at this point. I'm anxious about feeling like I NEED something to get to sleep rather than falling asleep like I used to, and my prescription is almost out. 

  
Not looking for medical advice, but hoping to hear if anyone has or is going through something similar right now. Has anything helped you to get back a semblance of normalcy? I'm scheduled to start therapy next Wednesday, but want to see if there is anything I can try in the meantime.

216,216,"I wanted to add my story for any mom out there who might be struggling with postpartum anxiety/depression and who is on the fence about whether or not to take Zurzuvae. I had the box in my closet for almost two months before finally deciding to start the medication, and now that I'm seeing the benefits, I wish I had taken it sooner. I am taking it at 7 months postpartum. 

One thing that kept me from starting earlier was the UTI side effect. I hate UTI's, and the thought of dealing with that on top of everything was overwhelming. The first day after I started taking the meds, I bought AZO and cranberry tablets and that helped me feel a bit more in control as I started the treatment. Sometimes, just feeling like I'm doing something proactive helps a lot. 

Background: I have struggled with postpartum anxiety since having my first child in 2020, but with this, my third postpartum, there were also definite clouds of depression. I have used the word ""hopeless"" a few times to describe my feelings to loved ones and my doctor, and that's how I knew that depression was in play. My doctor didn't hesitate to diagnose my PPD and to order the prescription for Zurzuvae, saying that it had been a ""miracle"" drug for the patients she had prescribed it for. I received the medication about two weeks later, and then I put it in my closet while I debated whether or not I wanted to take it. It was probably the PPA and PPD at the wheel because it was hard for me to overcome my sense of impending doom. Three days ago, I had a conversation with my sister and through tears, I finally knew it was time to give it a try. I was tired of not being emotionally available for my kids, the baby as well as the older two. I took my first dose at 8pm and then went to bed.

Day 1: Thankfully, my husband handles night feeding because I was so drowsy, I could barely walk straight when my older kid woke me up around 4:00 in the morning needing help getting back to sleep. It felt like I was drunk. I went back to bed and by 6:30, I was still very drowsy, but I was able to function enough for my family's morning hustle. I was able to drive my kid to school at 8:30 and I could function at work, but I felt buzzed or hungover for most of the day. I didn't feel any benefits on day 1. In fact, the drowsiness made things feel much worse. My head started clearing just as it was time to take my second dose, which I took at 6pm with hopes my head would clear sooner the next day.

Day 2: This was a dark day for me. I was able to function in the morning, avoiding driving until 10:00. I still felt buzzed, muddled, unfocused, and drowsy all day, but I also felt really down. Had I not decided to give it at least three days, I might have stopped taking the meds after this day. I was weepy, low energy, and just not quite there. I felt like I was doing a horrible job at work and at home. Hoping that the research would hold true for me, I took the third dose at 6pm. The drowsiness had been taking about 4 hours to hit me, so I was able to do bedtime and cleanup without any issues.

Day 3: I woke up feeling drowsy but...hopeful! The weather was awful and my kids were home for a snow day, but I was actually feeling, dare I say, happy. Other women describe it as feeling like a cloud has been lifted, and I can see that. I felt more at ease, less irritable, and just more present with my family and with my work today. I still felt a little muddled mentally, but I was definitely feeling the benefits of the medication and I did not hesitate to take that evening's dose. I took it at 6pm with dinner and two tablespoons of peanut butter, which has worked well for me. I slept well and hard.

Day 4: I was a bit groggy when I woke up, and I didn't feel the same ""high"" as the day before, but I'm not as groggy and dark as I was the first two days of taking the medication. I still felt irritable and short tempered, but I was not weepy or as down as I had been before. I was able to focus a bit better on this day. I noticed throughout the day moments that would have made me ""rage"" in the past but were just mildly annoying. I also experienced some benefits later in the day while prepping dinner for a group. We had somewhere to be, but instead of feeling tightly wound and anxious, I was able to tackle meal prep in a more relaxed way. It feels like the anxiety is being smoothed if that makes sense. I took my dose at 6pm this evening with two tablespoons of peanut butter, but I waited a bit to each dinner. I felt the meds hit hard without a meal in my stomach. I felt drunk and woozy. Once I got food in my stomach, I started equalizing.

Day 5: I woke up without feeling groggy and the day felt fine. I found that I was able to laugh and smile a bit easier, like I'm getting to some sort of equilibrium. I felt less groggy today and more like my old self. I was able to focus better at work, as well.

Days 6-14: I was definitely feeling less groggy in the mornings. Smiling and laughing came easier, and I was feeling more focused at work, which was a huge improvement. I guess I just felt ""normal"", but in a good way. My stomach felt a little ""off"" and I have had some congestion, but it's been very minor and maybe unrelated to taking the drug. I push all these days together because, at this point, the side effects had largely subsided. By the time I was in the second week, I was sleeping really well at night, and the grogginess in the morning was wearing off pretty quickly. Overall, I have felt more balanced after taking the meds. I still have some anxiety, some sadness, some grey days, but I feel like my low point has been reset. I have felt more hopeful, optimistic, and better able to let anxious thoughts go since taking the medicine. I feel more connected to my kids and better able to see the bright side of things.

If you are on the fence, just take it! I didn't know if my condition was ""bad"" enough to warrant the drugs, but I can see now that anything helpful is worth doing. I don't think I believed I really had PPD, but now that the clouds have cleared, I can see there was definite biological causes for my difficulties. I am now about a month out, and I'm still feeling the positive effects, so it was 100% worth it for me. The drawbacks were negligible, and the benefits have been remarkable.

The last year has been rough. We had a rough pregnancy with lots of complications for me and my twins. One of the twins was in the NICU for 45 days. The other was in for 124 days and in two different hospitals. She ended up having heart surgery out of state. Hardest 4 months of my life. In that time, I was able to bond with one of the twins at home, I was able to breastfeed her for a while before my supply gave up due to stress. The other twin was strictly on an NG tube so she was never able to breastfeed before she was out of the hospital. By the time she was out my supply was gone. So I never got that bond with her. She’s been home for about two months now and I have not been able to form a bond with her. She spends a lot of time crying no matter how hard I try to comfort her. I feel like she hates me.

273,273,"Okay this is kind of embarassing to admit. Ever since I gave birth 9 months ago I’ve been craving alcohol more than normal. I feel like a 21 year old college kid again. On average i have probably 0-2 drinks a day during the week, and 3-4 a day on weekends. My therapist told me the threshold for possibly developing a physical dependence is 14 a week so I think I’m starting to push it. There is a history of substance abuse in my family which has me extra concerned for myself.

For context, I’m medicated for PPD. I’ve really struggled with the lifestyle shift of being a parent and being tethered to a baby all the time. Getting tipsy/drunk is one of the only ways I feel I can cope, escape the dread, and tap into my pre-parenthood self.

I gave birth a week ago to my beautiful girl but my delivery was nothing but smooth and I keep having flashbacks from it.

I got an infection due to my water being broken which led to fever, nausea etc, then the hospital gave me antibiotics to help which I ended up being allergic to... basically I had to push my baby out while on 2 IV drips of benadryl trying not to pass out. After the delivery the nurse gave me medication to stop the bleeding which spiked my fever again to 40 degrees and I started throwing up uncontrollably, the hardest part was that I couldn't even hold my baby for hours and I was feeling delirious from all the meds they have me... the whole ordeal was so traumatic and I am just expected to move on and take care of my newborn right away, it just seems too much ...

319,319,"Hello everyone,

Long story short, I went through some fertility trauma/pregnancy loss late 2021, early 2022. I took a year off from trying to get my ""mind right"". I initially went through a deep wave of anxiety/depression for a month before it spiraled into these constant unwanted suicidal thoughts and images. At first, I thought I was having a near psychotic break because I never felt these feelings before, and they were constant. I tried Zoloft, and clomipramine, and they really didn't do anything for me. Prior to this fertility stuff, I was fortunate enough to never really experience anxiety or depression.

Long story short, over the years, they are still present, some days worse than others, but always there. I welcomed my double rainbow baby in late 2023, and was hoping they would stop but never really did. I decided to stop taking all meds due to great amount of weight gain and no real mental relief/benefits.

Over the last few months, I seem to have some struggles fertility wise again as things really aren't going my way with regards to it, however: I have been sleeping better and have had some really mentally calm downs. And now this week, they are really bad again. I love my family, I love my life, and I fear so badly that I will act on it one day out of feelings of hopelessness of never feeling better. I have normal energy, I try to work out and eat healthy every day, I go to work every day, I don't do any recreational drugs, and I rarely ever dink anymore.

So he went and found our cat who was sleeping in the window and that immediately calmed me down. Google also said if you’re struggling with breathing to cover your hand with your mouth and to breathe through your nose and that also helped.

398,398,"Hey all, 

I just finished Zurzurvae two nights ago to treat moderate-severe postpartum depression and anxiety. Prior to taking this I took one dose of Zoloft and it gave me tremors, suicidal thoughts (with no plans), rocking back and forth uncontrollably and insomnia. Before I took the one dose I had tremors here and there and insomnia with some crying. With the Zoloft if I tried to cry it would turn into a laugh. 

The Zurzurvae worked well for me for the 14 days more or less. I still cried here or there but it was controllable for the most part. 


Now that I’m two days off I’m back to chest pain, tremors, panic attacks with random crying fits and just feeling in a hole. Throughout the day I’ll have moments I’m ok but moments where I breakdown. I have an incredible support system. However, my in-laws are going to be leaving in less than a month and I need to get this under control before they leave so my husband isn’t dealing with this alone. 

I have a call with my psychiatrist in 2 weeks to decide if I should be on a longer term medicine (I am terrified and have been trying to avoid this but don’t think I have much of a choice). 

For context I’m 5 weeks postpartum and have historically been able to manage mild anxiety through talk therapy but this is a new level. The thing freaking me out the most aside from my brain not feeling like it’s mine is all the aches and pains I have being described as normal (aside from the postpartum preeclampsia I had).

5 months of feeling like every day is hell. Every night is hell. I don’t get a minute to myself. To be me. 

My whole life Ive been rather indecisive. But I always KNEW that I wanted to be a mom. I was always excited to have kids. To raise them. To have a family. I didn’t rush it, but was always excited for that stage in life. I’ve never been a huge baby person, but I love actual kids. But I figured if it was my own baby, I’d feel differently. 

I have PPD. But this depression goes beyond that. It is also situational. 
My pregnancy was difficult. I had every bad symptom in the book. I hated being pregnant. My delivery was terribly excruciating. 
Then, my newborn was extremely colicky and had reflux. The colic has finally started to die down, but, though he is smiley and cheeky, he is still very fussy. This is not one of these lovely unicorn babies you hear about with an easy temperament. I have spent every day since his birth trying to keep him entertained and not crying/screaming. 
The days we’re finally starting to get easier, and then the nights went to shit as the four month regression hit hard. My baby is up every 45mins to 1.5 hours. And will not, no matter what we try, go to sleep before 10pm and will always be up by 7am. I know if I even had an hour or two in the evening and morning to just be me and do my things and spend some time with my husband, everything would be different. 
I wanted this so bad but now that it’s here I feel like I’ve ruined my life. I had an amazing job that was my whole life and identity and was my community and second family. I had passion projects and friends and enthusiasm and a life. Now I have nothing. I’m stuck in the house all day with a screaming baby. I’ve never felt so dark and so bleak. I love my son, and am forever grateful for him, but I just want to feel somewhat alive again. 

If you had PPD or a similar experience, does it actually get better? Did you look back a year later and truly wish you could go back and tell yourself how great it gets?

**Background** 
I am 30 years old and I had a healthy easy pregnancy and a positive delivery. I felt a slight sense of depression when I got home. I felt overwhelmed and I felt like at night I would get the night scares. I also was very tired and the lack of sleep really got to me. His cries made me what to shut down, but at the same time felt my heart racing. The witching hour/purple cry really got to me and I could not care for my son for two days I remained in bed and did not leave it. 
My OB does 2 week postpartum checks as well as 6 week postpartum check. At the 2 week appointment I took the depression survey and as soon as I saw her started tearing up and she told me I was moderately depressed and rx zoloft. I took zoloft for a month and felt like it did nothing so I stopped it. I continued to be depressed, but high functioning and tried to suppress it. Then I rejoined therapy and was told about Zurzuvae which I was interested in once she told me it was only a two weeks treatment. 

**The process of obtaining Zurzuvae**
My therapist reached out to my OB who then asked to see me. When I saw her she talked to me about the side effects the main one being central nervous system depression. She recommended I do not work for two weeks since I am a nurse and to definitely not to drive for two weeks and informed me to take the medication with high fat dinner at night. 

Once I decided to go ahead and take it. I made arrangements to have my mom fly in from out of state to help me and my husband took time off/wfh to help as well. I got the prescription and had my insurance cover it since it is a specialty drug it cannot be picked up at your local pharmacy. In my case it was the specialty cvs and they mail it to your house. This is the part that I wish someone had told me **from getting the rx to me having it in my hands it took 1 week** so in my case my mom had to stay an extra week because I did not have the drug. I just assumed I could pick it up the next day. 

It also cost me $5,000 with my copay! But when I called they told me the manufacturer discount would bring it down to $0! So make sure you talk to your insurance/pharmacy. 

**Taking the drug**
I took it at night with a high fat dinner (eggs, salmon, avocado etc) and I would take it around 8 pm after putting my son to sleep. The first night it made me drowsy and I fell asleep after 30 mins. The feeling of the medication throughout the two weeks makes you feel like you are drunk (hence the no driving and working). It made me feel drunk during the day and dizzy probably until 1 pm and I did not feel like myself until 4 pm. I did not work for two weeks because I am a nurse, but even if I was not I do not think I could work and function regardless. I went to an orientation for 3 hours for work and I felt like the powerpoint presentation were going fast, but I was being slow. I felt like everything was going quickly and I was going in slow motion and just felt dumb to be honest. I drove a short distance 5 mins on day 13 in the afternoon and I felt so confident that I could drive and once I did drive I was like this is not safe. So please do not drive on this medication. 

**Did it work?**
Day 1-2: I felt like my depression got worst. I was crying 2-3x a day which I had not done in a while. I felt like a failure for taking this drug and felt like a burden to my husband and my mom for taking time off and flying in to help me. I felt sorry for my son for having a mom like me and just cried looking at me. 
Day 3-7: I just felt the same way I felt before the medication. Depressed but highly functional not like day 1-2 where I was truly the deepest depressed I have ever been. 
Day 8: This is the day that it hit me that I did not have that feeling or voice of depression. It had quiet down. I felt a sense of relieve, but at the same time was worried that this feeling was fake and my mind was playing games with me. 
Day 9-14: I consistently felt the feeling of getting better and it  plateau to a constant feeling of normality and that voice and anxiety had decreased. 

**Final thoughts/updates a month out**
I think it was worth it and it saved me. I was moderately depressed, yet highly functional. I felt a sense of doom and did not enjoy my son to be honest. Now after taking the medication I feel kind of a sense of being robbed of time since I took the medication postpartum 9 months. I look back at photos of my son when he was younger and feel like I could have enjoyed it if I did not have the depression. 
It truly felt like night and day for me now. I find enjoyment in being a mother and feel like I only made myself more miserable by not seeking more help before. 
Now when things happen I am not spiraling or getting mad. My husband is no longer tip toeing around me to make sure nothing triggers me. No when things happen with my son that would have easily upset me before does not affect me. I just breathe through it and I am able to power through. This is when I knew the medication had worked. I had this fear of the what if it doesn’t work? What if I had my mom fly in and my husband to take time off only for it to not work? But that is when my husband told me what if it does? And if it doesn’t we will find something else. But in the end it did. I am glad I was able to finish the treatment as it truly did help me. 

**please feel free to message me if you have questions. You are not alone and you are a great mother**

448,448,I’m having a hard time connecting with my husband after having our daughter. He’s counted how many times we’ve had sex this year and constantly reminds me bc it hasn’t been a lot. But I don’t really have a sex drive and when we do have sex I feel like I’m just doing it to please him and I’m not really into it. Part of it could be that I’ve been so irritated it’s almost turning into resentment. Ive brought my issues up to him before and he acts like I’m either being a brat or tries to let the day go by and hope I forget. Very anti confrontational. Our LO is 6months now and I have PPD that comes and goes in waves. The only thing that keeps it at bay is staying busy and getting out of the house every other day. The few times I’ve wanted to go out with my friends he’s guilted me into being home by a certain time and acting like I’m immature for wanting to be out all night when I’m the one whose here with her the most and sometimes need a break. Meanwhile he has gone on multiple trips for fun or out with his friends. The only time I ever asked him to come home I couldn’t stop crying for no reason and wanted to see him and he said he’s almost done golfing which then lasted 3 hours. He travels for work a lot and his schedules unpredictable which makes me feel like a single parent at times. I started therapy and she suggested having him come and it’s been 6 weeks because of his work schedule. It makes me mad bc I feel that he puts work ahead of everything and when I bring it up he tells me that we wouldn’t have what we do without it. I understand sometimes work has to come first but staying out at a bar because other people want to entertain you is not important imo. He doesn’t FaceTime every night he’s gone which is fine but when I go out he makes comments ab me not wanting to be with her. He made me feel horrible through my nursing experience bc I wasn’t making a lot and I was so exhausted and stressed he read articles ab how to increase supply which was thoughtful but pressured me so much. When I said I don’t want to do it anymore he said he had a say and I told him they are my boobs and my decision. I just feel like we are on 2 separate trains trying to get to the same goal. I don’t want to hurt his feelings but he isn’t listening to how I feel and pushing it off like everything is fine and for me it isn’t. I just feel so out of love now and idk how to get that feeling back ,,hard time connect husband daughter count many time sex year constantly remind bc not lot not really sex drive sex feel like please really part could irritated almost turn resentment bring issue act like either brat try let day go hope forget anti confrontational lo month ppd come go wave thing keep bay stay busy get house every day time want go friend guilte home certain time act like immature want night one whose sometimes need break meanwhile go multiple trip fun friend time ever ask come home could not stop cry reason want see say almost do golfing last   hour travel work lot schedule unpredictable make feel like single parent time start therapy suggest come   week work schedule make mad bc feel put work ahead everything bring tell would not without understand sometimes work come first stay bar people want entertain important imo not facetime every night go fine go make comment ab want make feel horrible nursing experience bc not make lot exhausted stress read article ab increase supply thoughtful pressure much say not want anymore say say tell boob decision feel like   separate train try get goal not want hurt feeling not listen feel push like everything fine not feel love idk get feeling back,1.0,0.5633234336588063

481,481,"Single married mom here… 31F and 8 months PP. I was diagnosed early on with PPA and PPD. It was a mixture of hormones, past trauma, my husband 34M checking out, and  job related PTSD (last responder care). I’m on Zoloft now and attending therapy (group and individual). Although my spirits are lifting and I’m receiving the much needed help things are still the same with my husband. We had a great relationship prior to our LO being born which is why I moved in with him, got married and had a baby with him! I was very adamant about not wanting any of that with previous partners until I met my husband. Yes, we had our moments but we overcame it all with ease and conversation. 

Now… I don’t even know. I’m the primary parent to our LO and homemaker. I endure the restless nights, feed, bathe/dress, attend all doctor appointments, and financially provide for our LO (we have separate accounts) including all the cooking and cleaning. Hell! The first two months I lived on the couch while he had a full 8-10 hours of uninterrupted sleep in our bed. Not even a diaper change! Like most of us… I went without food, sleep and showering. Going to the bathroom was a task in itself. 

But moving onto why I’m here in the first place… holidays. Thanksgiving was a doozy - he was sloshed by dinner time and LO started teething. So, I was really looking forward to Christmas. This will be LO’s first Christmas and I was really looking forward to spending the day with family. We typically have a nice brunch, play games, and lounge around while catching up since we all live apart. 

I told him literally for weeks in advance how excited I was and looking forward to LO’s first Christmas. What I was planning on making and asking him for suggestions. After all that… he booked tickets to watch a movie with a friend on Christmas day. If everyone lived closer and we didn’t have to travel that morning to meet with everyone, I would have been okay with him stepping away for a bit while we all lounged about. But we have to travel 2 1/2 hours the day of - no, Christmas Eve is not an option because of work schedules. He booked his movie tickets to a theater 30 minutes away from where we live, mid afternoon, and made plans to hang out prior to/after the movie like he usually does with this friend. 

I know LO will not remember their first Christmas but this year was rough… I was looking forward to seeing all the family and having my little family there, too. 

I won’t let it damper my mood but it sucks knowing that we’re not a priority. I could argue and fight about this with him , but I can’t force him to be a father or a partner…

488,488,"Hello, I’m 2 months and half postpartum. And I’m thinking of getting divorced after being married for a year and half. Reason being I don’t feel loved. When I was pregnant my husband would tell me I was beautiful when I complained about my weight gain and we were doing the deed until I was like 4-5 months pregnant. But since I gave birth he hasn’t called me beautiful once. The ‘i love you’ has become ‘love you’. The hug he gave me before he left for work or somewhere else seemed awkward, the ‘should I go in for a hug’ type of hug. He doesn’t seem interested in me unless I talk about our baby. He would rather masturbate then do it with me, and I addressed that to him and that I’ve been sexually frustrated too, he said he just needed to clear his mind for work, that was 6 weeks postpartum. Then we got intimate again for like a few days, when my mum was in town helping with our baby. Then it stopped again and I thought it was because my mum wasn’t here to help, but now that she’s here again, and been here for a week already, and our baby has been in her room, we still haven’t gotten intimate. I wore new nightgowns and stuff and it seemed like he didn’t at all. We have been arguing a lot after I gave birth, and he keeps saying we have to stay together for our baby. Since we got married we only went on a holiday just the two of us once. We spent our engagement celebration with his mum, my wedding wasn’t even about me but his friends, the whole time I was getting my makeup done I had to keep looking at my phone sorting transportation for his friends, then we spent our honeymoon with his friends and family, and again our wedding anniversary with his family. We were supposed to go on holiday together just the two of us today for two days, and let my mum stay at our house and mind our baby. But then I found out a few days ago that the schedule of our holiday consist of him going to the gym with his friend, and us having dinner with his friends. So I got upset and told him he could just go by himself then if that was the goal, so we argued, and he called me selfish. Also he had a pre Christmas party organized by his workplace which he didn’t bother asking me if I wanted to go with him, though he knew my mum would be here that day so I could go but instead he said he assumed I didn’t want to go. I asked him if he still loves me and why. He said yes and because I take care of our baby well, just that… no other reason. I don’t think it’s enough, at least not for me. Would it be selfish i decide to get divorced because I don’t feel loved? I don’t want my baby to keep seeing the unhappy me, I want him to see the happy me but I need to feel loved by my husband which at the moment it seems impossible. I’m lost, I feel like my life is over. I quit my job to be a stay at home wife, and lost my identity along the way. I love my baby so much, he’s so young, like he wouldn’t remember those time I took care of him… but I’m finding it hard to stay alive.

I get  postpartum rage like no other and try to ground myself with EFT tapping but the way I get angry over the smallest things is terrifying me. Not only that but paranoia started to creep in and I get crazy thoughts that I have this negative being watching me when I’m alone and intrusive thoughts set in. 

I’ve told my boyfriend and I know he wants to help but has no idea how. Sometimes he will have an attitude with me and I’ll snap and lose myself emotionally. He’s getting to the point where when I tell him how I’m feeling he just sits silent and lets me cry. I know it’s not his fault but I’m sure he’s exhausted from seeing me miserable all the time. I know it’s hard for him but I wish he could understand that I don’t even want to be with myself.

I have post natal depression and it seems to be coming in waves. I have some good periods where I feel like I’m doing well. I get out and go to classes with her and enjoy being a mum. But sickness seems to trigger low mood. I feel paralysed and struggle to do basic tasks like get out of bed, make myself lunch etc. I look after my daughter but I find myself cuddling her a lot on the lounge and having her contact nap on me. I find it hard to do much more than that and I feel like the worst mum in the world. I feel lazy and like she deserves more. I’m taking medication, have a wonderfully supportive husband, good support networks around me and I see a psychologist. When I’m in these low moods I feel like it’ll never end and that nothing will help. Everything overwhelms me and it all feels too hard. Sorry for the long post. If you made it this far thank you.

I’m 11 weeks post partum and while I absolutely love my son I still feel like someone just died.
More specifically me, or a part of me. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Every waking minute I spend worrying and thinking about my son. But all I really want most of the time is to run away and be free of all the responsibility. I keep feeling like he’d be better off without a mom who feels this way. I keep wanting to just go through the day without planning his bottles, his diaper changes, his tummy time, hearing him scream, sleep training. I just want to be me again. 
The only thing I do lately that remotely feels like me is go for a run 2-3 times a week. I put my headphones in and blast really loud techno and just run anywhere. It makes me feel for a moment I could actually leave. I never do. But it’s become such an obsession that I overdo it. I almost go every day. I’m scared because last time I obsessed about something like this I got an eating disorder. 
I also can’t sleep at all, the only thought that puts me to sleep is ending it all. Like literally thinking about it until I fall asleep. The weird thing is I don’t even have any plan to do it at all or even want to. It just feels like I am getting through the days and they all feel the same. I can’t even see a future further than a week from now. How am I supposed to do this parent thing for the next years????",,"hi

I’ve been dealing with postpartum rage as well that has been going on since 4 weeks postpartum. I am on medication and I am in therapy… just trying to be proactive since I have a history of mental illness and severe ppd from my first (5yo). 

The past two months have been HARD. But it’s not from the newborn… she’s been a dream baby. She’s been so easy! It’s my 5yo. It seems like everything she does just gets on my nerves. She is rude and sometimes mean. She’s been extra needy, too, which I get she’s a little kid and used to being an only child but it’s the whining I cannot stand. I get so worked up, like my body gets tense, I get filled with rage and it’s like I actually feel my blood pressure rise. I remind myself that she’s not annoying, I’m just annoyed…. But no. She’s annoying and there are times I cannot stand her. Im sick of hearing “mom” and “mama” every 30 fucking seconds. I feel so awful about it and I’m trying to work through it. I love her more than anything, but now I’m finding it hard to balance the baby and her at the same. I snap at times, but I’m working on coping mechanisms to control it, but I always apologize when I do. I try to turn it into a teaching moment and it also helps me to talk through it with her, but now she’s calling me a bad mom. It hurts my heart and a lot of times I feel like I am. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a mom. 

I dread picking her up from school every single day because it’s just the baby, her, and me for at least 3 hours until my husband gets home. I love her smile and how excited she gets when she sees me in car line, but then we get home and it’s like she purposely pushes all of my buttons and tries to make me mad. She thinks it’s hilarious. I will ask her what she wants for snack, something to drink, what she wants to do, but she never wants anything until I sit down to nurse the baby and now I’m stuck. I tell her she has to wait because I already asked her at least 3 times, but then she will throw a tantrum. Some days are really good, but others make me want to drive away and not come back.

I have a beautiful 2 months old baby boy. He was super wanted and he filled our hearts with so much love since the first moment he was born.
I have OCD and intrusive thoughts since 3 years ago buy with Lexapro and therapy I was managing well during pregnancy until 5 weeks after delivery when the hell started.
As mentioned above, I was doing amazing until 5 weeks postpartum. I started to get intrusive thoughts about my baby and my OCD and anxiety have been through the roof since then. 
Lately, I feel very anxious and sad, mainly of the thought that the connection and bond I had with my baby is gone. I hate feeling like that. I just want to be the perfect mammy for him and to love him so much. Everyday I pray I wake up the next morning and I stop feeling like this, as this feeling, the thought of it and the guilt are all I think about it all day. My anxiety levels are that high that my chest gets very tight sometimes. 
I am taking Lexapro still and doctor upped the dose a month ago but I can’t see any improvements yet.
I was always a very kind and loving person who loved children and I don’t understand why am I feeling like that if my beautiful baby boy is all I ever asked for.

The next morning I managed to get him to sleep and I fell asleep too.
My husband came in the bedroom, woke me up. He was hitting the end of the bed at my feet (not my feet). He was angry, I’d never seen him like that before. He had just talked to his mother who was threatening him to disown him if they cannot come and spend that Christmas with us (our first baby’s first Christmas at six weeks of age). Husband told me it’s all my fault that his mother turned on him.
Before birth we sat down and discussed our post partum plans with both set of grandparents (they all live abroad). Everyone understood and agreed.
I did not expect this. 
Apparently even in the hospital, my MIL was throwing tantrums over the phone and demanded my husband to book a flight for them, for only 2 days to see the baby. My husband kept all these from me. I wasn’t aware any of this when in hospital (was also in pain post c section and trying to breastfeed)… 
Since he apologised. But hadn’t changed much.
It’s all flaring up and I’m kind of reliving these experiences (and how he allowed his family to treat me) as my child’s birthday is coming close. I can’t look at those newborn pictures either as it all reminds me of how helpless, disappointed and confused I felt then….

628,628,"Yeah idk. Me and my SO met on hinge 2 years ago. We kind of instantly hit it off and have been inseparable since. In fact we got engaged fairly quickly and shortly after our engagement I had a car accident leaving me unable to walk for almost 5 months. We also discovered we were pregnant. He was amazing the entire time and took care of me in ways that nobody should even have too until we’re old and sick. I will forever be grateful for him for that. 

Well our baby came in June. Everything has been great and we love him so much and our relationship has never been better honestly. Our sex life is phenomenal, our late night pillow talk is back to how it was when we were dating, we have date nights together and we text more because I’m home with the baby and he’s at work. 

I am and have been suffering for quite some time with PPA. It been a little better baby wise, was hoooorrrible for the first month or two, and has now switched to other things including self image issues and my need to try to look better. I’m at my highest weight ever and as a girl who used to be able to go get her hair, nails and lashes done whenever I’m now a mom with very minimal time for myself. It’s been really hard. I’ve also been trying to loose weight bc it will make me feel better over all to be healthier, especially with what trouble I’m having with the repercussions of my injuries, that loosing the weight will make and help me get around better as a mom. (Before pregnancy 185, before birth 260lbs, now 240lbs and still going) 

So lately I’ve been feeling insecure in my relationship even though everything seems good with us. A lot has happened to us in our timeframe but I know we do love each other a lot. When I think about him (prior to this all of a sudden insecurities) he makes me feel safe, loved, heard and cared for. We truly believe we’re soulmates and I wouldn’t want to do life without him. But..

The other day we took the baby to his work for a holiday thanksgiving party. He introduced me and the baby and slipped up and called me Beth. Well my middle name is Beth, but his ex girlfriend who cheated on him with his bf while they were cling togethers name is also Beth. He corrected himself super fast and seemed extremely embarrassed and I didn’t even say anything to him about it because we were at his job and I didn’t want to argue about something like that when we never argue. We always talk things out. But for some reason my PPA wouldn’t even let me bring it up. It was like if I shattered our perfect relationship with an argument about it or mentioned  it I was gonna loose my mind. 

Another thing, he’s been weird about my best-friend. She currently going through a break up with her baby daddy. We both love her son like our own as he spends a lot of time with us. He keeps jokingly saying after we spend the day with them that he’s been “thinking” and that he and his mother (my bff) should move in with us. He says it jokingly as if he just wants them to do that bc he loves her kid but the amount of times he brings it up is starting to bother me. He also said something recently like it’s fine ik you guys love each other y’all can get married to each other and I’ll just marry you. Like no I don’t want to live and be with just you and not another woman thanks! Even tho I know he’s kidding it rubs me the wrong way?? 

Idk outside of all of this like I said has been great. We want another baby, he doesn’t even want to wait lol, and we want to get on with our plans to get married. He really is my bestfriend. Our families are planing to spend the holidays together and I’m just upset w myself for not just speaking up and letting myself fester in this way. Idk why it’s happening and it’s very unlike me. I think I’d I brought both of these things up hed be kinda shocked? 

Idk I just need advice and someone to talk this through w who is unbiased. Maybe someone who understands or has also had PPA or anxiety. 

We were both in really long relationships before eachother. Not ones that were good either. His ex cheated like I said and mine might have as he ended up with one of my ex bestfriends as well, so I think that that might have to do something with how I’m feeling as well. My ex and my ex bff getting together was a shock early into my pregnancy and I know I prob shouldn’t have cared but I was just taken aback that they could do that after being friends (10 years) and my bf (8 years) for so long… I think that I really felt blindsided and thought I knew my ex better than that and it’s seeping into this relationship. Like am I really just that bad at knowing peoples trie intentions when two very prominent relationships of mine ended and then they ended up together. Idk

677,677,"I had the idea to start this diary today as I was taking a walk with my 4-month old daughter. It’s a cold, gloomy day here where I live, and I was yet again feeling the horrible angst of anxiety lingering in the background. How was I going to “get through” this day with nothing on the calendar to keep me distracted?

I’ve lived with anxiety for almost as long as I can remember, and recently started experiencing depression to go with it for the past 3 or 4 years. I always used to wonder what was wrong with me, why I was so broken, and rage about how unfair it was that I was raised with some kind of thought pattern or belief system that kept me in this prison.

At its worst point, I thought about ending my life almost daily. I told myself the world would be so much better off without me as I saw what a drain and toll my depression was taking on my marriage and those around me. I didn’t see any point in continuing to try all the self-help techniques I learned in the thousands of dollars I spent on courses and books. I seriously believed that in a world of “survival of the fittest,” some people just aren’t cut out to handle all the mental and emotional challenges life throws at us, especially when you don’t really know what they are in particular.

To elaborate, I often really had no idea why I was depressed. I was born into an upper middle class family and always had anything I needed or wanted. I make six figures a year, and I have never had to worry about money or where my next rent check was coming from. I’m married to a man who also makes six figures and we’ve always lived in beautiful apartments or townhomes with nice new fixtures and stainless steel appliances. I’ve taken all kinds of vacations and stayed in some beautiful resorts.

Then, my baby girl was born in July of this year. Because I had already struggled with depression before I was pregnant, it’s no surprise that postpartum anxiety and depression hit me like a ton of bricks. Not only was I now struggling to get through each day with the feeling of emptiness I had already been carrying for years, but on top of it all I had a tiny, very needy little human who needed my attention almost 24/7. The hands-down worst part was that she hated (and still hates) the car seat, so even if I did want to try to go somewhere or do something with friends to try to enjoy life and feel some sense of connection, I had to mentally prepare myself for the heartbreak of hearing her scream and cry for the duration of the ride.

But amazingly, after struggling through postpartum for the 16 weeks of my maternity leave at work, I had a beautiful realization while on a walk with her one day as I tried to fight of the anxiety yet again. As terrifying as it was, the truth started speaking to me and I had one of the most beautiful, clean, bright moments of clarity. The reason why I was depressed suddenly seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and all I had to do was admit it to myself.

What I finally had the courage to let myself feel was that I was not at all happy with the life I had spent the last seven and a half years building. I hated my job even though my job title always garnered the admiration of other people. I regretted marrying my husband and getting married at all, and realized I had pushed myself to do what society says and “fight” for my marriage. I hated the townhouse we chose to live in and the area of town we were in, even though it was brand new. And most startling but matter-of-fact of all, I never wanted children. I had just wanted to avoid disappointing others (my husband very much wanted children and my and his parents were dying to be grandparents) and the judgement that is automatically passed on a woman who doesn’t want children (she’s selfish, she just hasn’t met the right man, it’s biological and she’ll “get it” eventually).

Ordinarily, I would have been horrified to admit these things (I had already spent the last 7 years refusing to allow myself to feel them) and been sobbing uncontrollably as I realized that I “got it all wrong.” After all, I was a huge perfectionist and my life was supposed to be perfect, not to mention how hurt other people were going to be if they realized this is really who I am and how I feel.

But recently, I had been reading authors like Markus Rothkranz, Bob Proctor, and Louise Hay, and I realized that the truth is really all we have and all we can rely on. Living our truth the only way we can be really happy, because what’s the alternative? Continuing to pretend and hoping it magically gets better someday? I don’t know if you’ve ever pretended not to be in pain when something is actually physically hurting you, but it’s pretty obvious that you can’t do it forever.

And so, I’ve decided that from now on, I will start being completely truthful with myself and ask myself what I REALLY want. Not what society or my parents or anyone else would be impressed by, or what even I myself “should” be impressed by, like choosing to be married. While I do want a partner who I love more than anything, I’ve realized that committing to them legally through marriage may not be actually what I want, and that’s totally okay. The sad part is I would have normally judged others if they felt that way, which I why I believe I snuffed out that part of me for so long.

My plan is to begin refusing to live parts of my life that are inauthentic to me, starting with my job. Maternity leave was perfect in that it forced me to make a decision between staying at a job I hate and staying home to raise my daughter. I chose the latter, and my last day at my job will be in six weeks. My family is pushing me to look for another remote job to replace that one, but I won’t be. I’m stepping out on faith that the work that I truly love doing will find me, and money will come as a side effect.

I am telling my husband I want to separate in a few weeks’ time. I don’t want anything from him and will let him take anything he wants from the house we share now, and I will be giving the rest away for free to anyone who wants or needs it. I have always wanted to completely start from scratch with my clothes, furniture, and other crap that I have accumulated over the years that doesn’t even make me happy. I am so looking forward to having a blank canvas to start living a minimalist lifestyle and thoughtfully build up my possessions with items I love and bring me joy.

Even though I never really wanted children, I love my daughter with all my heart and soul. I am dedicated to being the best parent I can be for her and being nothing but a support system for her authentic personality to come shining through and for her to express herself in the world in the way that makes her the happiest. I have been reading books like “Unconditional Parenting” and “Parent Effectiveness Training” so that I can be extremely mindful of my unconscious habits and patterns and hopefully break generational curses.

I don’t know what starting all over at 28 will be like, but I can’t wait to find out. I know there are moments where I’ll probably be more depressed than ever and doubtful that blowing up my entire life was the right thing to do, but I’m also choosing to accept that it’s just part of the process. I’ve already told one person about my plans and have asked her to support me when times get tough.

I’ll be sharing my diaries mostly as an outlet and a form of reflection for myself, but I do hope that in the process I can inspire others who may be in a similar situation to realize that they can do this too. It hurts my heart more than anything that so many of us struggle with mental illness today and don’t know why, but that the answer could be so painfully obvious, it’s too scary to even consider. I hope you all will follow me in my journey and wish me luck along the way, and I hope I can be brave enough to show anyone who’s reading this that changing your life is entirely possible.",,"idea start diary today take walk month old daughter cold gloomy day live yet feel horrible angst anxiety linger background go get day nothing calendar keep distract

678,678,"My wife is 1.5 months post partum and wearing me down with constant abuse even while I try to help. Everyone has told me it is PPD/A/R, but she refuses to see a therapist and constantly wakes me up at night during the half of the night when I'm supposed to sleep and she is feeding the baby such that I'm getting 3 hours of sleep a night on a good night and sometimes less. I do not wake her up while I am supposed to feed/tend LO.

But sleep is not even the half of it. She is sometimes indifferent to me (only speaking to direct me to bring her this or that), but frequently nasty about totally nonsensical issues (e.g. did not wipe the floor with the rag she normally uses) and sometimes actually abusive (throwing things at me). Our whole relationship seems to  have become transactional and/or negative. She shows minor signs of improvement from time to time, but almost always goes back to her bad behavior after a few days. 

Every now and again we joke or flirt, but it's often coming from me and on her end it's few and far between. This says nothing of what she has done with my MIL against me to make me uncomfortable in our own home. I can express no negative emotions (e.g. tiredness) lest I earn myself a round of loud reminders that she is more tired and I shouldn't complain. We can have no serious discussions where I do not immediately agree with her, otherwise she accuses me of manipulating her into yelling/throwing things (I try not to argue, but we still have to make decisions).

I have tried to remind her of how we met and fell in love and all the good times to conjure some good memories for me and for her, but it doesnt really seem to alter her attitude toward me beyond the few minutes when we have these conversations. I try sympathizing with her feelings of being overwhelmed, frustrated etc, but she denies having any such feelings. This is not the woman I married. Read other posts for more details.

Recently, we talked to my mother on video chat about entirely innocuous stuff (health, showing the baby, every day issues). My mother showed more concern, warmth, and love for me in that call than my wife has since our child was born. Afterward, I was noticeably emotional because I felt the loneliness and the hardship of being with my wife redouble in contrast to my mother's warmth and kindness. 

While I was blurry eyed and trying to suppress crying, my wife looked at me with contempt on her face and said ""whatever your problem is, we are not talking about it tonight, I need my sleep."" My heart went cold at that--like I don't need sleep too--and that she could say such a thing when I am obviously hurting. When I did actually discuss it with her the next day, she said ""you're just being manipulative"" and refused to own up to any bad behavior. 

Now here's the catch: because of local rules (not living in NA/Europe) my wife controls most of our money including savings even though I am the primary breadwinner (she's on unpaid maternity leave). I told her, ""I need X amount, please put it on this card so I can pay for therapy this month."" She says: ""it's too much, not this month."" I know she does not like my therapist, because my therapist has encouraged me to draw boundaries with MIL, for instance, and money is also not an issue. When she said this, my heart turned to stone for the second time because therapy is honestly my only lifeline right now.

I told her she needed to give me the money and I reminded her of our previous agreements not to leverage money against each other and that she would give me money I deposited on her account when I needed it. 

I got upset with her when she just kept saying ""no, no, no"", ""I'm not listening"" etc and I reminded her that her ex did the same thing with money to her and she hated it. After that, she simply shut down and refused to discuss it. In the end, when I insisted she transfer my salary from last month back to me, she said that if I persist with asking for money back or money for therapy, she will divorce me. I am so gobsmacked right now and feeling super vulnerable. I happen to know how to get my hands on a small portion of what she has deposited (enough to carry me through the end of the month without therapy), but I think if I take it out, it will be the end and she will actually kick me our of our home/seperate/divorce. 

I feel like I have to take this money for my own well-being and possibly survival, but the thought of it ending my marriage and probably any real access to LO, breaks my heart.

Advice would be welcome, but mostly perspective--I need to know if I sound insane or not. Am I being dramatic here or am I really in as bad a situation as I think I am?",,"wife   month post partum wear constant abuse even try help everyone tell ppdar refuse see therapist constantly wake night half night suppose sleep feed baby get   hour sleep night good night sometimes less wake suppose feedtend lo

702,702,"I’m already in tears after writing the title of this post. I (27F) have a 9 month old son who is perfect in all ways. He’s slept through the night in his own room since 3 months, isn’t ever fussy, and is happy all the time. He’s given us no trouble outside of regular baby needs. 

I grew up with a deeply disturbed, narcissistic mother and an enabling father, with whom I finally went no contact with last year. All my life I wanted to be a mom and give my family a better life that my siblings and I had. I’ve spent years in therapy getting professional help and finding medication, and am in a very happy, healthy marriage.

Now that I am a mom, though, I’m absolutely miserable. I want nothing to do with my son or motherhood in general. I stay home while my husband works and every day when I hear the front door close after he leaves I burst into tears because I don’t know how I’m going to do another 10 hours alone with him. My MIL is great and helps with him a ton, however even after a full day without him I dread picking him up. 

I had a really hard time bonding with him for the first few months and it got better for a bit, but now it’s like he’s not even my own baby. I feel responsible for taking care of him but I look at it like a chore. I absolutely despise myself for feeling this way - I have a happy, healthy, and sweet baby, which a lot of people would do anything to have. I feel broken. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me or why I am this way. He is just a baby and hasn’t done anything and doesn’t deserve a mother who doesn’t want to be around him. I cry constantly because of the guilt. My husband comes home and is completely obsessed with him and it makes me feel so ashamed of myself. 

I am the first of my friends to have a baby and he wasn’t planned. My therapist says the way I feel is normal for a new mom but I just can’t imagine any other mothers wanting nothing to do with their child the way I do. I’m so terrified of accidentally becoming my own mother, who was self-centered and unaffectionate - but it’s like something inside of me is incapable of motherhood. I don’t know what to do. 

I had bad postpartum and my PMDD returned after giving birth, both of which I have found great relief from in hormone therapy in the last few months, but I’m not hormonal I’m just miserable.

728,728,"I’m getting more angry by the moment. Yesterday, I went to my counseling session and on the way home almost ran over my 6yo boy. He rode his sled down the driveway and into the bushes at the end. I was worried about if my van would make it up the driveway and was contemplating how much I should accelerate or just ease up into the driveway. I was so mad and scared he had done this. I had specifically told ALL the kids no sleds and no shovels (they leave the snow shovels out in the yard and lose them when it snows). 
My daughters 15, and 13 were supposed to be watching the kids. The 15 said she had checked on the boys outside every few minutes and didn’t realize he had gotten the sled. I believe her but I was so shaken and sad yesterday and last night.  
I’m going to counseling to feel better, not to come home and almost run over my own kid. 

So this morning I want to go to the gym and I am scared to leave the kids at the house. I can take 2 small ones to the gym daycare and then at 11 is parent teacher conferences. My husband is working out of town. So he wasn’t here last night to help with kids and he is not here this morning. I texted him and told him I was scared to leave the house with the girls watching the kids. He thought it would be ok if I just took the baby and the 6yo to the gym. But what about the other kids? So I suggested maybe I should stay home and do a home workout instead. The intensity won’t be the same and the kids will interrupt me and pester me while I’m working out. I’m doing a 6 wk workout challenge so I have to work out.  
It’s not fair I am left at home to figure this out. This always happens to the SAHM. If I was a man I would have a wife and I could just leave when I wanted and go have my workout and not be bothered to worry about the kids. 

Yesterday, we had a long conversation before he left. He asked me if I want to leave or divorce him bc I keep telling him that he deserves someone better than me. I just want to disappear. He asked me what would make me happy. I told him I would like to somehow quietly extricate myself from him and the kids. They don’t need me and he just needs someone different than me. 
I honestly can’t think of anything good about myself. I feel like I am worse this week than I was last week.

756,756,"FTM in early 30’s, LO is 3 months old and I feel like it’s getting tougher and tougher each day. I am very sleep deprived and ever since he was born I never experienced that sleep of at least 3 hours and so. I can say he is a very difficult baby. We’re still up 4-6x per night. I just got used to it I guess, preparing myself everyday to a battle (that I guess will never end). 

So during my 6 weeks postpartum check-up, I was referred to behavioral health which I still haven’t process until now, they diagnosed me with PPD plus PP mood disturbance, I just told them the guilt that I felt when my milk supply got lost and I can’t do anything about it but honestly it is more beyond that, like I really can’t cope up with this role, I feel like Im failing, I feel like shit. Everytime my LO cries I just really want to scream and sometimes I really do scream at him and that scares me and feeling terrible and guilty after. I mean I really do love him but this is so hard.
I never had thoughts of harming my baby but many times to myself, I usually tell my baby and myself that “Lord please just let me die if this will be my life every single day night.” And sometimes I do feel like I just really want to hang myself, it’s just so overwhelming like I don’t know what I’m doing wrong each time my baby cries and I do feel jealous with mothers who have easy babies. 

Baby daddy says that he doesn’t believe in PPD and that’s one big factor as well. Plus family members live nearby the area but not single one of them offers help nor ask me if I am okay or doing fine instead they always mom-shame me and bash me with all the ways how I handle my baby. To add up, yes my mom offered help but I refused because we’re not just okay, she used to abused me physically when I was a child up to my college years so I promised myself I will never let her touch my child.

770,770,"Hey guys. I’m new here, just had my baby girl 7 days ago. I wanted to just post here to get some feedback/ advice? (I do have an appointment booked with my therapist for next week also) 

So to start off, I had a pretty traumatic birthing experience. Long story short, I labored for 30+ hrs in the hospital, had some complications come up, and then ended up having an emergency c section. (Also relevant: I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past) 

Labor started Monday and I had her Wednesday. Then I had to kick into mom mode and figure out having a newborn and adapt to her while also now trying to recover from having a major abdominal surgery. (Very thankful for my husband because he was there the whole time, was the one that advocated for us and ended up saving our daughter’s life). 

Anyways, all that to say: my brain never had time to catch up and realize or comprehend what just happened. It’s now the following Tuesday and I’ve been having extremely intrusive thoughts (never to hurt my baby) but of ways that my baby COULD be hurt. To the point where I feel like leaving my bed is a danger. Now I try to move past these thoughts because I obviously can’t keep us in bed all day and I do get up and around but my problem is, once I slow down, they come back. And my anxiety is through the roof. Not only with the intrusive thoughts, just life in general. I have horrible anxiety when my husband goes to work (just feeling him gone hurts for some reason). In addition to the normal emotional roller coaster of crying because I love him and her so much. 

I keep myself busy to the point of constantly moving to do something. Doing laundry every day, pumping every couple of hrs, cleaning my breast pump tools, cleaning her bottles, feeding her, changing her, doing and catching up on my assignments (I’m also in school full time for masters), etc. So when I sit down (mainly at night when my hubby is sleeping and my brain won’t shut off, I panic and overthink and cry and worry and everything else under the sun. I dread night time coming because I know what is about to happen. Every day so far. It’s like I’m trying to stay busy to run from my mind. 

I don’t know where the question is here to be honest. And I’m sorry this ended up so long. I just guess I needed to type that out. Is this normal? Is it just postpartum? Or could this be leading down the road of PPD/ PPA? Thanks for reading �",,"hey guy new baby girl   day ago want post get feedback advice appointment book therapist next week also

771,771,"First and foremost, I wish everyone here the best with everything that they have going on, as this is a very hard battle to handle and you all have my respect and empathy. Both the one having the PPD, as well as the partners being there to support them through this tough time. 

So this is more of a vent that I need to get out, but good faith advice would be welcomed. It is kinda long, Sorry! 

I (34M) and wife (37F) had our first/only LO about 4 weeks ago. My wife developed PPD/PPA and it has been the hardest thing I have had to manage in my life for a very long time.

I am at a loss dealing with my own guilty feelings for decisions I have made as well as trying to stay that strong and be supportive partner and show that I have my shit together when inside I am very much ""faking it till I make it."" 

My wife had an unexpected C-section as our lovely daughter decided she wanted to come 2 weeks early. Thankfully she was born healthy and beautiful! The reason for the semi emergency c-section was that my wife started to have preclampsia. This was an obsticale in its self. 

That day she told me she was going to go home because her BP was high, I told her to meet me at the ER as it was high enough to warrant an ER visit. She would not listen to me though and insisted on going to her OBGYN instead, I tried to tell her to just to to the ER but no luck, obvi the OBGYN was like why are you here and go to the ER. So long story short the Inducing and c-section was not planned (and have come to find out it is a risk factor for developing PPD, along with a few other risk factors I have now found in my own research.) 

So the PPD/A.. 
The days before the birth my wife had a few red flags that in retrospect I should have seen. She mentioned things like she ""wished she never got pregnant"", and that ""our lives would be much better if she didn't get pregnant"", etc. I brushed these off as normal things to be scared of because I mean you know... First Time Parents lol. 

After the birth while in the hospital she was trying to not have the baby come to the room as much as possible. I could understand this to get our rest as the first two days we were both exhausted, as this was all unexpected. She did not have anything packed for the hospital stay, I on the other hand had everything packed ready to go for me and the baby thankfully. On the third day in the hospital I told her we should have the baby overnight so we can get used to feeding the baby at night and if we have any questions we are in the hospital and can ask them. She was very hesitant about this, but I insisted for my own comfort too as I too am a first time parent. This should have been another sign to me though as everything was going okay otherwise, but she just did not want to spend time with the baby.


After getting home, everything was fairly smooth sailing for the first couple days, she seemed depressed and down but I just took that as the ""Baby Blues"" and the extreme fluctuations in hormones. After about 2 weeks though things began to progressively get worse. I noticed at night she would become extremely anxious and flustered and just looking around the room like she didn't know what was going on. At her 2 week OBGYN visit the Dr. Said that she only had the ""Baby Blues"" and it was okay and normal. A few days after this I told her to have the OBGYN call me. (I didn't have her personal number) I spoke with the OBGYN and let her know that things were not getting better and that they were in fact getting worse. The OBGYN then prescribed her some Lexapro. She started taking it for two days before the below event. The OBGYN also suggested a few psychiatrists and a hospital to go to in case of an emergency. 

This all culminated to an event Saturday night at midnight. She was trying to breastfeed the and she was looking extremely flustered and anxious. I noticed that she was making a fist with her hand (although I am sure she was not going to hit the baby) but she made a fist still in her anxiousness. I gently took the baby from her and said that I would feed her. (At this point we were doing both breast feeding as well as bottle feeding with the breast milk so she would have time to rest and not focus on trying to feed every 2 hours.) After I took the baby from her to feed her she broke down and started yelling at me ""the baby's going to die, the baby's going to die, the baby's not going to be able to eat, the baby's going to die."" 

At this point I called her family because I did not know who else to call at midnight to help in this  situation. There is a language barrier between myself and her parents, specifically her mother, as they speak Spanish and I'm only learning right now and I do not know enough to explain this situation effectively. (It is something that I am working on though.) So her aunt and her parents came to the house and spoke with her as I fed and took care of the baby. Her family and I decided during this time that it would be best for her to stay the night with her parents away from the baby crying etc, and I would stay with the baby to take care of her for the night alone and she could get rest. We would re-evaluate the next day. 

On Sunday we decided that it was best to take her to the psychiatric hospital to be evaluated to see if there is any thing that can be done to help her. Well... they decided to keep her for the week. (FML) This devastated me, as I felt that I let her down by taking her there and having her be admitted there for a whole week. I spent nights crying that week while she was in the hospital hoping and wondering if I did the right thing. She has said multiple times that they did nothing for her. She felt that it was ""a summer camp that she was not able to leave from"". I struggle with this still and question if I did the right thing by taking her there. She did show signs of self harm (not necessarily suicidal), however there were signs.

During the time she was in the hospital I took care of the baby at night/rest of weekend. Thankfully her parents were able to help during the day during working hours so I could work from home and be able to provide for us, as I no longer had any sick time or vacation time left to use, as it was used all for the birth of my daughter. 

After my wife was released a week later I felt happy that she was home however, I feel that things are still not good and that I am drowning in my own feelings of trying to be supportive for her as well as trying to be the main caregiver of my daughter, as my wife is not able to help effectively. She has helped a few times in feeding/changing, however she is very much not wanting to be around the baby nor wanting to hold the baby or anything like that at this time. I do all the cooking (always have) and I try and take on all the house work I can, but only so much time in the day lol. 

It has become extremely difficult as I feel like I am taking care of not only my newborn daughter alone, but also trying to take care of another person that is not able take care of themselves and is adding extra stress and mental loads. 

Today was my first day back at work in the office. (boss doesn't like WFH smh) My wife is at her parents house with the baby as she is not allowed to be alone with her. I asked my wife if she could send me a picture of her and the baby, so I can see them and that way she can feel that I am being part of her day still even from a distance. She sent me a picture of her, and then a separate picture of the baby in the bassinet. The baby was laying on a folded up sheet with a blanket over the top of her chest and legs, and the pacifier handing from the leash above her. I immediately wrote back saying that it's NOT okay and that the baby needs to be in the bassinet with just themselves and no loose blankets, nothing underneath her, etc. for safe sleeping practices and reducing the risk of SIDS. This is something that her mother did, and has done a few times. I have tried to iterate that this is not okay to do and things have changed in the last 40 years. This is where the language barrier hinders as well as she is not my mother but my MIL. I told my wife I need to be able to trust her when she is at her parents to make sure they are doing things safely. Thankfully she sent me a video afterwards showing the baby in the bassinet safely sleeping. 

I am struggling to try and be that supportive person/rock, as well as working, and trying to trust that her family going to do the correct practices to make sure that my daughter will be safe. I know they're not doing it out of ill will, but just out of being uninformed. 

This is all really straining me mentally
as I need to be hyper vigilant that she is not left alone with the baby, judge her mood and her anxiety levels so as to know if she is okay to be around the baby, making sure my daughter makes it to her pediatrician appointments, working to pay bills, and making sure she's fed/changed when not at her parents during the day. I have no problem taking care of my daughter, I enjoy it in fact (which I never thought would have been something that suited me well.) I have thought many times that this would be easier if it was just me doing this alone. 

Thankfully I go to therapy for myself, (which I started before the birth of my daughter for separate reasons)

Each day I do feel I see a glimmer of hope, but I don't know if that's just me being optimistic as every day is still very much a challenge. Hopefully the medication begins to work and in time things improve.

This is just something that I need to come to terms with and to try and be the best partner/father that I can be.

783,783,"I’m almost 7 weeks postpartum (had a bit of a traumatic birth + an episiotomy). I’m not ready to have sex yet, the thought of it really scares me and I just have no sex drive whatsoever. I have pleasured him twice (orally) since I had baby but felt like I was doing it for his sake. Every time any intimacy gets mentioned I refuse and I can tell he’s not happy and gets quite moody about it. We have argued quite a lot about it too as I found him looking at other women on his phone and when I mention that he says things like “what do you expect me to do” I don’t know if I’m being stupid by getting upset at the fact he’s looking at other women but I’m also not fulfilling his needs so do I just have to be ok with it? I hate my body and the way that I feel and it just makes me feel worse. He also makes me feel like it’s not normal to feel like this and I don’t know how to help him understand. Like is he meaning to make me feel like this? Does he not have respect for me anymore? ( I had asked if he could just not look at other women whilst I feel how I do about myself, even too look at pictures of me instead) I really want to be happy especially for my new baby but I feel like I just think about this a lot and it really does get me down. Im having to worry and stress about this as well as everything that comes with taking care of a newborn. Im also breastfeeding and doing every night shift on my own as he works throughout the day so I’m always tired and that’s another thing that gets to me.

I thought by the end of my 12 week maternity leave this would get better but it seems to just have gotten worse and worse. I really don’t even want to live anymore. I don’t see a future where I can continue being a mom. This feels like a nightmare

I used to look forward to the end of the work day because I don’t totally love my job, but now I’m going to dread going home and seeing my baby. I feel trapped and like I can’t be happy anywhere. I feel so selfish and like I’m putting myself first. But in total honesty, I wish I never had my daughter. I look at her and feel so much regret it hurts. 

I need this to get better and I don’t know when it will. I spend so much time away from the baby and my husband just pretending like she doesn’t exist. I don’t want to live anymore.

792,792,"Hi everyone, posting here because I'm learning the hard way that men can get postpartum depression. And, as someone who's also been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder (formerly diagnosed with Chronic Depression) this has been extra challenging.

I'm thankful to have an amazing wife who's been extremely supportive throughout this, but I don't have any friends I can talk to about this, and I've been struggling a lot. I've been on meds that work really well for the past 3 years, and this past week it's like they just stopped working. And even though I'm no stranger to depression, I forgot how fucking debilitating it can be.

Fortunately, this hasn't resulted in any negative feelings towards our beautiful baby boy or towards my incredibly kind and supportive wife, but I'm barely getting through the day. Also, as a man with mental illness, I've suppressed my desire to cry so many times from a young age that I can't cry when I know I need to (this has been a problem for years). I've even started to get up earlier than normal to do yoga and meditation and clean, but it just feels like it's barely holding back the storm instead of actually making things better.

I just want to be the best husband, father, and me I can be, but I'm struggling.

So, any dads here with PPD? Or anybody here who has pre-existing mental illness? 

Thanks everyone, and stay strong.",,"hi everyone post learn hard way man get postpartum depression someone also diagnose bipolar   disorder formerly diagnose chronic depression extra challenging

843,843,"TLDR; after 3.5 years being with my kid nearly 24/7 99% of their life …I am now 50/50 co-parenting and I don’t miss my kid when she’s at Dad’s. I’m not even inclined for goodnight face times. I feel bad that I don’t miss her or want to call her. 

My kid is 3.5. I am co-parenting, and have been emotionally separate from the dad since I was pregnant and physically separated since kid was 2.  The whole post partum so far has been tough on me, I did not get a lot of support emotionally or even physically at all-  hence the separation. I pretty much was a totally single mom. I did everything with very little offer for help, not even help around the house!!  I also was EBF. Pandemic baby. 

The first time I even was away from my kid EVER they were already 1.5 and I had to practically beg with over a month’s notice for him to watch her alone so I could have my first girls day/ DAY OFF since I gave birth. 

When she was around 3 and I was EXHAUSTED, separated and nagging Dad to please take her, I had realized I have been physically and even a large portion of the time skin to skin with my kid for 3 years straight minus MAYBE 2 weeks out of the entire time.  

I also wfh and cannot afford childcare. 

In the last month or so he is now finally getting more consistent with the schedule and he’s been taking her about 50/50.  

Now that I am getting real time for myself sometimes I realize I go all day and  I don’t even miss my kid. Today I realized the whole day went by and I didn’t even have desire to call for goodnights. I feel bad about it. some post of moms here that really struggle doing custody split and I am here not even thinking about my kid at all. 

Is this normal? I feel like I should be missing my kid more and wanting to call her but I figure dad’s time is his time and I don’t want to interrupt or make her emotional seeing me because we have attachment style and I know it’s hard for her. 

Dad of course is a nuisance with constantly FaceTiming 2-3 times a day during my time. I honestly detest it. My kid also hates it she will literally kick and scream crying that she doesn’t want to talk. So I figure she doesn’t even like FT so why stress her out? So I am rarely initiating FT but Dad insists that she say good night to me. So he does FT me usually every night he has her (she never fights him on it like she does with me.) Tonight I could tell she miss me she was trying not to cry. I felt like it would been better for me not to FT but he texted saying “she wants to say goodnight” but I honestly don’t think she even brought it up, I am sure he is the one that suggested it. 

I don’t know why he insist on FT and is so adamant about the good night every night. Like she literally rejects him and cries EVERY TIME but he still forces the FT every night. I hate it. I just want my time and his time and not have to facilitate face times. Am I wrong to feel this way? (there is no court order or plan. We are not involving courts)

Should I miss my kid more? I feel like it’s probably normal given the context but also feels not normal. I feel like I SHOULD want to call and at least say goodnight but I honestly don’t think it’s necessary.

The first appointment, the councilor just asked me about the birth of my daughter, while was really traumatic. It didn't take her until my second appointment yesterday to actually look at my paperwork and see the boxes I had checked, which had my GP, OB, and husband scared I would do something harmful to myself. 

Honestly, the only thing keeping me here is the knowledge that if I died, my husband probably wouldn't be far behind. If that happened, I don't know what would happen to our daughter, and I don't want her placed into the system. We don't really have a village.

I am 7 weeks postpartum and literally feel like I’m drowning. I can’t do this anymore. I have postpartum anxiety and depression and was put on medication for it over a month ago. I thought it would get better. It’s not. 

In the beginning my husband was really helpful and supportive but lately has been treating his leave like a vacation. I’m starting to resent him for it. While he’s going out to dinner, etc with friends, going fishing/hiking, and gaming for most of the day, I’m literally living in the same 3 hour cycle. I’m doing the majority of the feedings- day and night (my baby is formula fed, not breastfed), bathing him, doing tummy time and all the interaction activities and when I’m not doing that and he is watching our baby, I am doing laundry, cleaning, cleaning/making bottles, going to the grocery store or doctors appointments. 
When he has asked me what’s wrong, I have told him time and time again that I’m drowning, I’m struggling, I’m overwhelmed. He says we are in this together and that I’m doing a great job and I’m a great mom. But we definitely are not in this together. We had to be induced 3 weeks early because of preeclampsia and hypertension, I couldn’t breastfeed, my body is going through hell and my liver is now showing signs of damage. I’m killing myself just to keep up. 
Things really boiled over when I did 2 nights of being up all day/night with the baby back to back and then I didn’t wake up to him crying on the 3rd night, my husband did. My husband gave me shit the next morning about him having to wake up TWICE to feed him and I lost it. I completely shut down. He asked me what’s wrong and I kept saying nothing so I wouldn’t snap on him. Then he got pissed at me for not telling him what’s wrong. We haven’t spoken in over a week aside from communicating about the baby. 

He has always been an incredibly loving and supportive partner, especially during my pregnancy. Now it feels like I’m barely getting through the day and he couldn’t care less. He just wants me to come to him and make it better/resolve it and talk to him but I don’t see the point in repeating the same thing over and over. Now…He has no empathy for me or the fact that I’m barely keeping it together. He won’t respond to me or offer any comfort. Nothing. 

I love my son so much. So much. I don’t regret him at all, he is the best baby. But every single day I wake up, I’m disappointed that I did. I lost my life and I just can’t do this anymore. ",,"

I had my son 3 months ago and it's been difficult from the start. I still only get 1 - 3 hours of sleep a night and because of my living situation I can't seem to get more than that. It started with me randomly having emotional breakdowns and crying hysterically. I now recognize that I have intrusive thoughts as well.. things will be fine (or not) and I randomly think of harmful things to myself or child and it scares the shit out of me.

904,904,"Hey there-

So I believe I had post partum depression when my first was born 11 weeks ago. It lasted until 6 weeks. Then I suddenly seemed to snap out of it after spending time with a friend of mine who always seems to put things in perspective for me. 

From 6 weeks up until 2 days ago I felt good. I was in a routine with my baby. Felt I had a handle on things and was chuggin along not feeling depressed. And then last week I came down with a cold. For the first few days it was fine and I was dealing okay. I even went out with the baby to target and carried on like all was well.  When I woke up the next morning I felt so sick. I am not a person who gets sick often so I feel that I get extra frustrated when I do. 

I swear that morning I didn’t know how I was going to possibly take care of the baby by myself. Luckily my husband was able to stay home from work and help. Although I still ended up doing half the child care. 

The following day I miraculously felt better and we went out and had a fun weekend with friends. The baby even slept through the night for the first time. When I woke up Monday morning to start my day I felt right back to where I was before 6 weeks. Depressed and overwhelmed by the thought of the never ending responsibility of motherhood.   How I will never have time to myself again. How there is no me anymore.  

I think being sick is what brought back up these feelings. Similar to how I felt when I got home from the hospital after giving birth… like I needed time to recover but couldn’t bc I am a mom now. 

Something about being sick and feeling like I have to take care of baby even when I care barely take care of myself really gets to me and sends me spiraling. 

I question if this is even post partum depression or just the reality of my life setting in ?

As I rocked my baby to sleep tonight I started crying hysterical thinking about how ungrateful I felt to be the mom of such a beautiful baby. ",,"hey

912,912,"Is it post partum when you literally don’t want to be away from your baby and in the same respect want to be away from the baby for just a little bit but can’t because your baby won’t let anyone else hold him? 

I’m 9 weeks pp right now and trying not to go back to work next week and I just keep feeling like the world is going to end if I have to bring him to daycare. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and hoping she will help me get short term disability extension but in the mean time I’m panicked and feel this overwhelming feeling of dread and anger.

I had my aunts over ( my mom died when I was young I have no other support) to help me with my 3 year old while my husband is working and they even tried to hold him and he wouldn’t let them hold him for more than 5 minutes. I can’t even imagine leaving him at daycare where they have 10+ other kids to take care of while mine is just screaming for me. I can’t even fathom that, I need more time with him, he needs more time with me. 

They (my aunts) just laughed and wrote it off that he just loves me so much. All I wanted to do was cry.  I got so angry that they didn’t try a little harder and I got mad at myself for getting annoyed with my baby. 

The fact that people say that it’s hard and that everyone feels this way, yea I get it a lot of people feel this way but do they really?? How invalidating to tell someone who literally feels like the world will end next week if I have to bring him to daycare.

We can’t afford for me to stay home without getting paid, I can’t put my family in danger like that but at the same time I literally dread the feelings that will inevitably come.

With my daughter we had to bring her to daycare at 6 weeks and I cried and cried for weeks while I worked. I felt so guilty and upset and alone. Now I feel even worse going into it and I can’t even imagine how i will feel away from him.

I’m exhausted, I’m annoyed, I’m scared. I’m angry. Ugh.

I am 5’2 and weigh 160lbs and I genuinely feel like I look like a ooompa Loompa and think about it all day. I don’t know a lot of people who’ve had c sections which makes it hard to talk about it without sounding crazy.. can anybody else relate or am I just vain??

943,943,"I (32f), started feeling ppd when baby was 7months old, think it's way easier to stick a postpartum depression diagnostic on exhausted mothers rather than face the real problem : lack of support. As woman, we are expected to mold to our environment much more than men. If we have a hard time fitting into said environment, fault is easily placed on our shoulders and we need to go to therapy, take pills, spend hundreds on self help books to try and find what we can do better. I don't know about y'all but I've been doing all those things all my life plus being clear about what I need from my environment yet it's not enough. I became a mother - I mean, if that's not a good enough reason to expect just a bit more while I adjust, I don't know what is. 

Can I just be like, exhausted of trying to be better, do better and  ask less when my environment washes their hands of wrong doing since a mental health diagnosis was plastered on? 

I don't think postpartum depression as we know it is doing us any favors. I think we are just very tired, feel unsupported and feel alone. For me, ppd right now feels invalidating to my feelings and my exhaustion and a way to make me expect less. 

I think if you start feeling ppd at 7months like I do, maybe you're not the problem. 

Let's take our pills ladies and carry on.

948,948,"I don’t have any help and it’s starting to weigh on me. My baby is 2 months old. My MIL is always doing something else and I basically have to make an appointment for her to do anything helpful. My husband can’t watch the baby for 30 minutes without freaking out and needing me to take him, and I have no one on my side. I only get away from my baby and can breathe for maybe an hour every couple weeks. I feel like I’m losing myself in motherhood. My husband acts like he does a lot for the baby but he might change two diapers when he gets home. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a SAHM so I knew I’d be doing most of the childcare but he was supposed to help when he got home. Instead he’ll clean the house. I want to clean the house. I don’t want to be strapped to a baby all day and all night. I love my baby but I’m losing patience and it’s not fair to him. I’ve asked for help in so many different ways even just telling my husband “can you take him so I can nap” “how long” “maybe an hour” “too long”…. And he still wants me to feel like having sex at the end of the day. We had a big talk about how being rejected hurts him and that sex is important in a relationship. I agree that it is but so is mutual respect and sharing the mental load of things. 

He handles the mental load of moving money to each account and going to work. I have the mental load of managing a budget, taking care of a child, trying to clean the house, dealing with his mother who refuses to honor boundaries unless given to her in a very specific way or just not at all (which he “hates to ask me to put up with but that’s just how she is”). 

I do the shopping so I have to load my baby up and take him with me cause she’s never around to help. I’m the one who has to find time to do the laundry, the dishes, the counters, the floors, the bathroom, eat, take care of the baby, make bread, get groceries, bathe the child, and that’s just before he gets home. Once he’s home he wants 20 minutes to “decompress” then all he sees is what didn’t get done. 

He won’t always outright say “what did you do today” or “how did you not get anything done”. Sometimes it’ll just a a sigh or a disappointed look at the sink or couch. Like I’m doing my best! Please just say something good.

He’ll do some cleaning and get pretty much everything that I need to do done in like 3 hours (minus shopping and childcare) and then ask why it’s so hard for me to do things like…YOU DIDNT HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY WHILE DOING THAT. 

Not to mention that my baby is a Velcro baby. He HAS to have a contact nap throughout the day or he won’t sleep at night (don’t comment on that. We will have different opinions and quite frankly idc what anyone has to say about it. I’ve tried to fix that but it doesn’t work). 

Yes as of late he’s been sleeping through the night but I don’t. I get horrible nightmares now. Ever since he started only waking up once a night I’ll get nightmares or night terrors whatever you want to call them. 

We’ve had talks about all of this but the night terrors and it doesn’t change. He still feels like he does more just because sometimes he comes home and swaps laundry or washes a load of dishes. But I’m exhausted, covered in spit up, probably have shit on my hands, and haven’t eaten yet. I know I went on a rant and I’m sorry.
