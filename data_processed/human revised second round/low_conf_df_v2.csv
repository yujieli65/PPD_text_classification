178,"Few weeks ago after DCF was investigating my family, a detective called and told me I have to come and talk to him or get an attorney to speak with him. I told him I'm definitely not speaking with him but will try and find someone to talk to him. Obviously that was a fail and not many attorneys got back to me. I was in the middle of moving so I also kind of forgot about it especially because I was moving along with DCF and doing visitations etc with my sons. He called again today and said because I didn't get someone to speak with him he had to move on with his ""investigation"" and he sent it to the prosecutor. Now I am being charged with 2 counts risk of injury to a minor and 2 counts assault third degree. This is all due to unexplained markings to my twins during a postpartum depression/psychosis episode.

I’m hoping to get these charges dropped but I am devastated. No prior record, I worked as a toddler teacher for 6 years, no issues and then I fell pregnant. I was also a part time nanny and then my sons were born premature. I had lost my job because my leave ran out and my sons were only 4 lbs when they came home. But one was medically complex so I devoted my time and savings to be at home. I am also a single parent. DCF was already involved before the detective stepped in. My plan with DCF is reunification and my mom has temporary physical custody of my boys. They asked me about my mental health one time after my sons were born and that was that. The detective when he called suggested I come in today to “turn myself in”. He stated the judge granted my bond PTA, as in “promise to appear”. So, he claims, as long as I show up to fingerprint and mugshot etc, and then show up to court I shouldn’t have issues with bond. Over the phone he made it seem like the judge was being too nice given the charges. It hurt, because he is a man and I don’t expect him to understand the severity of this mental illness. I’m hoping the judge shows more compassion when I’m actually in court. I plan on getting a court appointed attorney as well. Notes: When my sons were getting evaluated by the hospital, I checked myself in the hospital voluntarily because I was afraid that I did do something without the knowledge. I am now on two different medications and have been actively seeing the psychiatrist, I saw my therapist since my sons were in the NICU. My sons have had regular doctors appointments sometimes twice a week others once every week since they got home. They have seen every mandated reporter since they were born, and there has been no worries up until their physical therapist called at their daycare session early January. They also attend daycare regularly unless they have their 5 million doctors visits. Unfortunately My memory of the incident is consistent with postpartum-related dissociation and/or severe depression symptoms. At first I was angry at being accused but now I feel like I'm glad it happened because I would've never known. Any advice or just words of encouragement is appreciated.",,"week ago dcf investigate family detective call tell come talk get attorney speak tell definitely speak try find someone talk obviously fail many attorney get back middle move also kind forgot especially move along dcf visitation etc son call today say not get someone speak move investigation send prosecutor charge   count risk injury minor   count assault third degree due unexplained marking twin postpartum depressionpsychosis episode

184,"My oldest is 14 months and I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant with #2. I was on Lexapro through my whole first pregnancy for baseline anxiety and depression and then doubled my dosage after I gave birth and was subsequently and unshockingly diagnosed with PPD. 

About 3 months ago I moved states, and lost my psychiatrist, so lost my Lexapro. We had talked about me trial-ing being off so I figured might as well do it now. 

I was doing so well. I was feeling strong, I had the tools I needed, I was happy, then I got pregnant. 

Now I feel miserable. It's like my old self has reared her ugly head back in. I'm hopeless, I'm anxious, I'm sad. I know my hormones are wild right now, but I don't feel like I can do this for another 7 months, but going back on meds when I was doing SO WELL off of them feels like a failure, for me and my peanut. 

This sucks. I don't even know if I can find a new psychiatrist since I assume most of them are going to give me the ""dangers of ssris in pregnancy"" spiel. Has anyone had success getting mental health prescriptions from their OB? 

Life was so good and now I'm so sad.

My husband and I rotate taking the night shift for a few days in a row just based on work needs. I had Thursday and last night. Last night was particularly difficult for me, reaching the point where my husband woke up at 3 AM to me pretty hysterical. It was just really bad through this morning. 

Tonight was like a punch in the gut when I went to take my son for the night shift again, like I do every Saturday and my husband said he’s not comfortable with me taking the baby. It’s not a fear that I’ll hurt him, but he just looked disturbed by how frustrated and upset I was last night, and rightfully so. I’m disgusted with myself. I feel like I’m ruining all of our memories. His first Valentine’s Day closed with me being a complete depression monster. I did the same thing on Christmas.

I am a mom to two beautiful babies, and I love them so much but I feel so lost. I feel like I’m not even here/not present with my children. I put them first always and cater to their needs but when I look back at photos I feel like I don’t even remember those things happening or like I was a different person 6mths ago, a year ago, 2yrs ago.

Even when it comes to my career decisions I struggle to make decisions because I want to be a role model for my two girls and want them to be proud of what their mom does. Will they be proud of me for staying home with them or should I grind through more schooling to pursue my career goals? I am constantly weighing my options for everything from my career, their wellbeing and schooling, groceries, renovations, cars, trips etc to decide what is most economical, efficient and benefits the kids the most and I never prioritize myself. I have always been depressed and still get lost in that at times but this feels so much more than the ebbs and flows of my usual depressive episodes, this is a constant aching of feeling a lack of purpose but then a profound guilt that I shouldn’t feel that way because my kids and motherhood IS my purpose. Gahh, I just feel so lost and trapped and like I don’t know what the hell I truly want and I wish I could escape but I could never do that to my kids, so I just lull through each day and feel stuck.

I take my baby 4 to 5 days a week as that's the arranged schedule. 

I try to support her as much as can with the terms I've been given. She allows me to do bed time routine every Tuesday & some times Thursday.

I wasnt forced, i just never really thought about having kids. Decided it was the best time to have one while i was on leave( it was supposed to be a year long break to finish my exams. 

I got pregnant pretty quick and suffered chronic UTI throughout the pregnancy. My baby was also very large so i had a lot of pain and trouble breathing by the end of pregnancy. Had a very traumatic delivery as well. Ended up with a 10 pound baby who never ever sleeps. 

In all of this my husband has done nothing. The bare minimum of giving a bottle of milk once or twice a week, taking care of the baby for a couple of hours once or twice a week. 
I am resentful, he has sacrificed nothing for this baby, not a single night , and he is being hailed as a great father. I have done everything and i am being made the villain for complaining about lack of sleep and for asking my husband to help more. 

I have gone through so many sleepless nights that i have started having hallucinations and nightmares and sleep paralysis. I begged my husband to care for the baby one night so i can try and sleep 8-10 hour at a stretch. 
He slept before i could actually make him go through this. He slept 10 hours the next day as well. And the next day. 

He works, i dont. And somehow that makes it easier for him to do no childcare and everyone justifies it as well. He was also very unhelpful during my pregnancy and made me cry hours after postpartum . He forced me to keep a name his parents wanted and didnt speak to me postpartum until i agreed . 

I am so tired. I have stopped interacting with him now and i am getting religious texts from his mother about how i need to find god to cure my depression and texts from her son about booking a psychiatrist.

It was a tough almost 1 yr going through that alone but i’ll never forget the things MIL did and said to me at that time.

Recently i was looking through old pics of my daughter and emotions from my ppd days came flooding in. I started to break down bcs the feelings i felt still seems so raw. Im supposed to visit my MIL but i told my husband i didnt want to see MIL bcs of this raw feelings and flashback. - important to note that we do visit her every 3-4 weeks but she’s demanding to visit every 1-2 week now and its causing me major anxiety thinking about seeing her that often

He was visibly upset and he didnt understand why i “couldnt” get over it. I told him he wouldnt understand bcs i was so alone and the feelings are still so fresh in my mind, even though it has been 2 years.

The last two weeks I have no idea what’s wrong with me but I just feel so numb. I used to enjoy going to mom and baby groups and now I just feel worthless and like there’s no point in going. My husband works long hours and some days he doesn’t get to see the baby at all. I put her to sleep every night and it takes usually an hour, and then I’m the one waking up with her all night since we co-sleep and I’m breastfeeding. I count down the hours for him to get home just for him to be late. I feel like I never get any breaks, we don’t have family or close friends nearby that I could trust with baby. 

Just tonight I went out with friends and I couldn’t even enjoy myself. I just feel so sad. I’m not sure what to do. I have an appointment with my counsellor in a few weeks but I think I might need to talk to my doctor. I’m upset that I’m going through this.

347,"I currently have 2 babies under the age of 2. I returned to work back in December, and at first, I was elated. I had postpartum depression last year with my daughter, but with my son, I was much better. I was excited going back to work and getting back into my normal routine of things.

Immediately, I returned to a complete shit show. Nobody’s fault, but I came back to 3 of my coworkers out on FMLA themselves. Wishing them all the best, as none of this is any of their faults or their problem. 

The problem is, one of the girls that are out works a shift that starts at 5 in the morning. I work in a healthcare setting. My normal job is back end work. So, I work on accounts and I have my desk job upstairs, but I am expected to cover the admitting department areas when needed. When I first took the job, I knew that it was in my job description to cover occasional vacation times and requested days off. 

Well, now it has turned into coming in at 5 in the morning every single day, which has put an enormous amount of stress on my babies, my partner, and my whole family. My husband does not have a set schedule at his job. Some nights, he’s not getting home until 10pm and other days he’s going in as early as 7am. Neither of us are getting any sleep.

When I expressed the emotional and physical toll this is taking on my family, I was told that this is my position and that this is what is expected of me. I have been refusing to come in at 5 some days and told them that I will be there at my normal 9am scheduled time because I do not have anybody to watch my babies that early some days. My sister and my mother help out as much as they can, but they have full time jobs themselves and can’t always help.

My hair is falling out, I’m dealing with overly tired infants, because no matter what I do, the second i wake up, they wake up. They are both still breastfed. 

I didn’t realize how much it was affecting me until I found myself crying on my way to work some days because of how stressed out I am over this. I have lost 40 pounds since returning to work. It’s to the point where I just don’t think this is worth it anymore. I’ve put my application out to 15 different places. I’m hoping someone will call me back soon. I can’t take it anymore.

368,"So I'm 9 months postpartum. I was not prepared for the insane amounts of rage and I have never cried or screamed so much in my life. But I'm doing my best and trying to be a better version of me everyday. Now that I feel my partner and I are somewhat out of the metaphorical trenches and have a routine flowing now, things are much better. But neither of us realised that by becoming parents ourselves, it literally cracks your psyche right open and all of your wonderful repressed childhood trauma spills right out. We have both been working on things and how we respond to situations and people and frustrations. He has realised his own parents were never there for him emotionally, never let him express emotion at all, lied to him, only made him feel worthy if he could do things for them and got treated like an absolute inconvenience. This has turned him into a people pleaser and he struggles to put himself first. His parents have the most dysfunctional relationship and his mother clearly doesn't get what she needs emotionally from his dad/ her husband and tries to fulfill that with her son (my partner). I never realised how controlling and self absorbed she was until I got pregnant and had my baby. She didn't ask how I was going basicly the entire pregnancy, when I laid out some fair and clear boundaries in the family group chat, she just laugh reacted it. My partner reluctantly invited her to the hospital a day after I gave birth just so she didn't get upset as my mum had been in quickly that same morning (my mum had helped me wash all the baby clothes, set up the nursery and baby sat my dog while in hospital in labour) and when visiting my MIL kissed my daughter on her head. I grabbed my baby back and was devastated. I spent that night in hospital holding my baby alone just sobbing all night long. After this when we got home she posted a photo on Facebook of my daughter after being asked not to (before I had posted) and when I asked her to remove it she said "" I guess I've just fucked up again"". Because of hormones and PPD and existing anxiety made worse by the hormones etc, I spent the first few weeks just sobbing and feeling so furious and betrayed. His dad is now so cold to me because his son (my partner) actually puts his own new family first and doesn't go building houses and doing jobs for his dad for free in his spare time. My partner runs his own business and not once has his family asked how it's all going. He started it in January last year and our daughter was born in April. He did it so I can be a stay at home mum. I had a good relationship with them prior to getting pregnant. - for context I've known mu partner 20 years and we have been together for 10 years. But yeah since I don't just go along with everything they say and my partner holds boundaries now they are cold and rude. My partner has told me horrible things his dad said to him growing up and now it all makes sense some of the mental impact it has had. I resent them both. Can anyone relate or have advice.

I’m just not the person I used to be. Almost everything my twins do upset or anger me and it’s breaking up our family now that my partner and I are splitting up. I won’t go into all the other emotions I’ve felt, but I’ve not been in a good place for quite a while now. 

But, I did it - I finally phoned the GP and asked for an appt. They’re seeing me next week. The receptionist asked me the nature of my problem so they could make sure I’m seeing the right practitioner (I’m in England btw). When I told her I think I have ppd, I just cried while saying it. I knew I couldn’t hold it back. She’s the first person I’ve said it to. This Reddit post is now the second. It feels weird to be finally accepting it and that I need help. 

I’m scared now though. Can anyone share their experiences of what it’s like to take anti-depressants? I’m scared it won’t work, that I’ll feel nothing.

I luckily had a supportive husband, family friends and doctor who got me back into a sound headspace after 6 months. Now I  feel guilty about not enjoying those months with my child because every single day I wake up I can’t imagine a life without him or being his mom. I love nothing more in this life than being a mom. It’s crazy to me how complex our brains can be. To go from one end of the spectrum to another.


Jumping ahead a bit. 

My LO is approaching 2 and my husband and I are talking about having another. If it was up to him I would have been pregnant months ago but he is understanding that I am nervous and need time. there’s no pressure from him at all. He just loved being a dad haha.

I feel like I’m in such a wonderful spot now so I’m looking for advice from other moms who have struggled with PPD and have another child. I want a second but I am truly terrified of struggling again and now while taking care of a toddler. I don’t want him to see me the way I was. It’s truly been such a mental block for me to consider a second but in my heart and soul I know I want this.

Looking for any words of wisdom or advice here for anyone who has gone through a similar thought process. Hoping this is a safe space for opening up about this. It’s been difficult for me to speak about it.

390,"Long post, i am sorry. But I hope someone reads.

Where do I start...We have been married 7.5 years. Wife is 32, I am 36. We Have a 5 year old and almost 15 month old boys. Happy, healthy boys. 
My wife hates me and wants to divorce me. I didn't break down and cry when she had the conversation with me, because I've been having that conversation between us in my head every day for the past 8 months since she finally broke to me how she felt about me 8 months ago. I was pretty prepared, just dreading it. 8 months ago it all started out as a random text I sent to her in the middle of the work day that said, I want to figure out how to get closer to you. I was blind sided by her response which was, the more you try to get closer to me the more I'm going to push you away. That conversation continued for a long time, further explaining to me how terrible I am, how I failed her, how she felt abandoned after our first son, how she felt alone after our first son, and how all of that from 4 years ago made her the way she is today. There were other details to the convo. She had some good points. I could have been a better father the first time around, I was trying to figure fatherhood out, she wanted me to read her mind or the situation and just know what to do. I didn't all the time. We had all of those arguments 4 years ago, I would accept my failure, apologize, and try my best to be better and do a better job. I am continuously accepting my failures, apologizing, and trying to get better and improve myself. Well the conversation ended on a bad note. We obviously had problems and I had thought all these problems had been resolved in the past, but now they are back and to blame for how she was.  I suggested that we go to counseling. Her response was that she was not interested in doing that. I was crushed.
Back up to before we conceived our 2nd son. I thought we were happy. We just got done building a house. We finished the inside ourselves and I finished the basement almost right away. My wife started online schooling as a prerequisite for a program she was entering. She was stressed. I was doing my best to support her, watch our son as much as possible, i do all the cooking, and take care of the house upkeep and projects. Early on with our 1st child, I wasn't the best at changing diapers or giving baths. Once I realized my failure, I changed. Since then, I think I've been a good father, I at least actively try to be each and every day. I absolutely love my son. 

So we get pregnant with our 2nd. Everything seems fine and happy. She's excited to tell me, we're excited. Everything seemed fine until 3-4 months in to the pregnancy. Suddenly she started getting more distant with me.  She never let me come with her to any of her dr. Appts with our 2nd. I was there for every one with the first. She was more agitated, overall just less happy, and more stressed. Her online schooling didn't help. I tried my best to be with our oldest as much as I could to take as much load from her as possible. Our oldest at the time would wake up in the middle of the night and come jump into bed with us and we were so tired, we'd let him stay. We'll that wasn't working. We all had terrible nights sleep. Eventually I said this has to stop and I would take our son back to his bed every night and spend an hour getting him back to sleep so my wife could get her sleep. I tried to clean up the house more, rub her feet more. I was constantly asking her if she needed anything, are you okay, I love you, how are you feeling. I would always get very short answers saying I'm good, i don't need anything, and the very routine I love you you too. I didn't believe any of it was true but what could I do? I rubbed her feet as much as she'd let me or want me to. To shorten this up, I tried to be there for my wife as much as I could think how to. 

At this point I wasn't aware of post partum depression and the seriousness of it. Looking back now, this next experience could have played a role in what her ppd is though. She really wanted a girl. We go in to check, and it's a boy! My response was to laugh only because our 1st son is such an amazing little handful. Her reaction was disappointment initially before it just turned into acceptance. I didn't think too much about her reaction at the time.

Fast forward to delivery day. With our first son, when the midwife tossed him up on her chest, her reaction was pure shock, and happiness, and disbelief. All in a good way. When the midwife threw our 2nd up on her chest, i was teared up, but when I looked at her, she turned her face away from me and it was a look of pure anger. I can't in any way understand what it's like for a woman to give birth, but I was a little taken back by her reaction...

She only took 8 weeks maternity leave instead of 12 like she was allowed. She was worried about money. She wanted me to go back to work after taking 1 day off, so I did. My mother in law is retired and is a huge help whenever asked or needed, so I wasn't too worried. It was the same case for our 1st son.  I felt our marriage was getting better through maternity leave. I'd come home from work, try to change as many diapers as I could. I was still cooking every meal, playing with our oldest son, trying my best to care for my wife, tell her how good of a mom she was, asked to get her whatever she needed when breastfeeding, the list goes on. I took over completely baths for our oldest during her pregnancy, and after our 2nd was born, I continued that, and still do most today. We were getting back to laughing a bit more, flirting a bit more, touching more, hugging more, i was feeling better about us. When the last week of maternity leave hit, it was all over. Everything just went downhill. She won't text me anymore without me texting first, won't tell me I love  you unless I tell her first, she won't talk to me in person anymore unless I talk to her first. It seemed/seems like our entire marriage is solely on my shoulders. During our conversation 8 months ago, she told me that she's just angry all the time and everything makes her angry. This really took me back, so at that point I started looking in to ir and looked into ppd, ppr, and the phycosis part too. I didn't know of anything that would relate to ppp, but I was floored while researching that she had 70% of all the other symptoms. And then suddenly dots were connecting in my mind from incidents after our 1st was born too. She has also always suffered with depression and I was shocked to see how much more likely she is to getting ppd because of it. 

I've researched so much, learned so much. I've tried telling her I'm worried about her, only to get laughed at. I try to support her, ask her if anything is wrong, can I do anything. To no avail. I've told her if there's anything I can do to be a better husband and father to let me know....crickets. I try to take her on dates, not interested. Try to start watching a TV series with her like we used to do, not interested. Tried to have uplifting conversations, wouldn't participate. Cooked her her favorite meals, she didn't really appreciate them. I tried and tried and tried. She eventually told me that the only time she's happy is when she's alone and on her phone, mainly TikTok. I tried telling her that being alone was only going to make everything worse. It has. She disregarded it. I put our baby to bed every night, she puts our oldest to bed. As soon as she's done with bedtime, she goes straight to bed and I'm pretty much not allowed to come to bed unless it's after 10. She gets more sleep now than she ever has in her life, but yet she's exhausted and tired all the time. She's on her phone constantly. In front of me and while she's with our kids. She's lost a ton of weight and she's not trying to. She's skinnier than she ever has been since I've known her, and she's not trying to be. She'll switch her personality between me and the kids constantly throughout the day. From happy, to annoyed, back to happy, constantly.

Well our conversation early this week started with her saying we need to talk. Now we've never been good communicators, or good at conflict resolution. I've always wanted to be but it's hard because she responds in anger to so many things, i get scared to talk through so many things.
She started by telling me that I deserve to be loved by someone who can give me love. She built me up, how great I am and everything and I deserve so much more than what she can give me. And said that she's not that person, it's not in her, she doesn't have that anymore. I asked her why she doesn't, and then she goes into all of the reasons I'm such a terrible person and treated her terribly, and made her feel alone and abandoned, and this i why she feels the way she does. Tells me that we haven't been happy since before our oldest was born. I told her that's news to me and that's not true. I told her when I noticed things weren't good anymore. She looked puzzled. She told me it's not fair to the kids to have parents that are never happy and the only option she sees is that we need to seperate. I brought up ppd to her again as I had multiple times previously in the last year. She excused it and said that's not what I is. I pointed out very specific symptoms, she disregarded them. I asked her to do counseling with me. She said she wouldn't. And wouldn't give me a reason why. I told her that I loved her so much and that I wouldn't quit fighting for her. She told me I needed to respect her decision, and that was the end of the conversation.

There are so many details I left out of this long post. I live my wife so much. I don't want to lose her. I'm 95% sure this is ppd, but she has me second guessing if maybe I am just that terrible of a person. I don't think I am? All of her family notices how well I treat her and how she doesn't really reciprocate very well. I'm not trying to trash my wife. I'm just trying to detail what's been going on. How do I help my wife when she doesn't want to be helped and when she doesn't think she has a problem? Does she have ppd? How do I support her. Does everything have to fall apart for anything to get better? I'm a lost husband trying to hang on right now. I want my wife back. We used to be happy. Now it seems like everything has fallen apart.",,"long post sorry hope someone read

And so last night my daughter wasn’t sleeping and was screaming I was breastfeeding her to calm her down and then I was kicking my cat out of the room. He got up grabbed my shirt and my phone and threw it off the bed and screamed why do have all this fucking shit in the bed all the time and called me a dumb bitch started laughing at me and took the baby and screamed at me to go to the other room and shut the door on me. I was hysterically crying at that point I told him how what he said hurt me he gaslighted me and said I was remembering things wrong. I told him today I have severe ppd when he was getting mad about how sad I’m acting he said I look too many things up and read too much into that stuff pretty much saying snap out of it .

405,"I just need some reassurance that things get better. 

I’m seven weeks postpartum and I’m only now starting to feel some sort of hopelessness. I struggled with emotion regulation during pregnancy and never felt joy of being pregnant among the difficult symptoms that came with pregnancy. 

There was a lot of change that happened all at once. My boyfriend moved in after a year of dating and I immediately got pregnant. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and mild OCD. Medications stopped once I found out I was pregnant and I struggled with control which caused arguments with my boyfriend. I will say that he tried hard to limit these arguments and most of them were started from me. I’ll take accountability for a lot of our arguments but I felt like I couldn’t control when I got controlling and angry. I tried and looking back, I could have tried harder. 

Our baby girl is amazing. I never experienced a love like I did when I first looked into her eyes and she was placed in my arms. I would die for this little human. I felt like I did well with recovery and up until this point but arguments between my boyfriend and I are more intense than they’ve ever been. 

I know it’s adjustment for both of us. Finical responsibility has fallen on him and care for our child is mainly on me. I knew this would be the case and prepared as best as I could. A reoccurring argument that gets brought up is I’m not making him feel appreciated and loved in our relationship. I have a different love language than he does and I think that’s the cause. It’s been so reiterated that when I try, it falls on deaf ears and I know that’s my fault. 

Our lives changed and mine changed long before his did. I was the one who dealt with the emotional and physical changes from the beginning while he got to keep his normal life a little bit longer. I’m struggling with being stuck at home with no source of socializing. It’s really taking a toll and I miss being able to get out of the house without packing up a baby and considering her naps and now long I’m out. 

I know I don’t do enough to reassure my boyfriend and sometimes I don’t take into consideration how his life has changed and focus on just on my feelings. There are other things happening that would take too long to get into but I need someone to tell me this passes. I don’t want to break up with him and it has never crossed my mind but he brings it up sometimes. Whether he means he wants to leave or not, it just brings me down when he does bring it up. He says he doesn’t want to leave but I can’t help but think he does when he says it. 

I don’t know how to express I appreciate him in the way he wants. I have a lot emotions I’m trying to work through and I feel like making sure our baby is taken care of is my top priority. I’m emotionally spent. I feel like he thinks I’m using this as an excuse and don’t understand what he’s dealing with too. I do. I wouldn’t have paid less attention to protection if I didn’t feel like he was worth having a baby with. 

I want to try to better but he doesn’t accept my tries because of our past. I’ve explained all of this to him and it still causes issues. All the pent up emotions are just overwhelming and I’ve cried for the last couple days. I don’t think I’m at the point where I need to schedule an appointment to discuss alternatives but maybe I am. 

Has anyone dealt with this? What were the outcomes and things you’ve done to make things better? How do I not get some emotional and what can we do to move forward. Cause right now we either go backwards or at a stalemate with arguments. ",,"need reassurance thing get well

444,"Hi all,
Struggling deeply and profoundly at 7 weeks pp. I had such an amazing pregnancy, and was so excited to start this new chapter with my husband. All those feelings evaporated after my birth experience. I labored for 20 hours, developed an infection called chorio, and had to have an emergency c section. The entire thing made me feel like such a failure, and watching my husband be able to care for our baby while I was in pain made me feel useless. I also lost my mom 4 years ago, so a major resurgence of grief has been bubbling to the surface. I just keep thinking how much support she’d be giving us, help, and love in general. I have such an intense longing for her, and I cry every single morning. Because I’m so sad, I feel like a burden to my husband. I don’t feel like my fun and vibrant self. I suddenly feel insecure and like any woman would be better than me for both my baby and husband. Since my mom died, I isolated myself over the years and I’m entering motherhood with borderline no friends and also a very shitty support network. I’ve never been so low in my life. I’m scared to die but I also don’t want to live either. No, I am not planning anything. But I do get why some women are pushed to the brink. I just don’t see a light. Nothing is going to bring my mom back, my personality feels profoundly fucked and changed which could ruin my marriage, and I’m not just going to magically have a support network/friends. I’m alone. If anyone has words of hope, I need them today ",,"hi

460,"This is my third bout of depression following pregnancy. First time I didn’t link it to postpartum depression because it followed a miscarriage in the 1st trimester. I recovered 8 months later when I started bupropion. 

Second time, I had severe ppd, plus ocd and hypomania after the birth of my daughter. This was despite staying on bupropion during pregnancy and trialling about 12 medications postpartum. The second time the depression lifted only in month 7 of my third pregnancy, when I stopped all meds, including bupropion.

461,"Hi all, this will be long so I really appreciate anyone reading long! I had my first baby in April 2020 and had terrible PPD and OCD for 18 months. It took that long to start to feel better and the road to there was horrendous. I felt like I was locked out of my life, couldn’t feel any positive emotions etc. But when my daughter turned 18 months or so, I felt myself coming out of it. Since then I’ve been pretty much recovered, except for some anxiety and lingering OCD. It took me a long time to even consider having a 2nd baby because I was terrified of it happening again. 

Fast forward to last December 2023, I had my 2nd baby, who arrived 5 weeks early. He spent 8 days in the NICU but came home very healthy & happy. Despite some initial anxiety, I had the most wonderful first year with him. So much so that I was considering a 3rd baby! I felt like I had totally healed the broken part of me that was robbed of that experience the first time around, we had an amazing bond and I felt so much joy. I had huge issues with guilt for *not* having that experience with my 1st but overall, it was a great year. 

Cut to 2 weeks ago and I was due back to work from maternity leave. I’m in Ireland so was off for nearly a year. I had anxiety about going back to work as my son is EBF and I’ve only spent a few hours away from him. My mom looks after my daughter who attends school now and was also taking my son. I work remotely so they were downstairs, not even far away. That first day I had what can only be described as a total mental health crash. I was extremely anxious and started experiencing derealisation. Everything felt weird & foggy. I pushed through till day 2 but it got worse. I could feel myself declining rapidly so I went to my doctor who agreed I was medically unfit for work and signed me off. I don’t know what’s happened but now I have this horrendous depression. I can’t feel my connection to my son or ANY positive emotions at all. I’m existing but the colour has gone out of life, I’m not enjoying anything. I’m absolutely devastated as I’ve gone through this during my son’s first Christmas, like I did with my daughter. I’m on meds as I never came off them during my 2nd pregnancy. I do think I’m burned out from the last year where I took zero time for myself, despite having a supportive husband. I’m back in therapy in January but I just feel so scared, alone and distraught. Could PPD happen nearly 1 year postpartum? Please share your experiences & stories, I feel so heartbroken.

I was diagnosed with moderate/severe PPD at 2 weeks post partum, I experienced some horrific thoughts and feelings as well as quite substantial difficulties bonding with my baby. 
Fast forward to today, I’m now medicated and under the care of the perinatal mental health team. 
My depression is slightly better, I am mostly stable, albeit with the occasional drop in mood and tearful day I can get on with my day to day life fairly well. I have a fabulous bond with my daughter now; and I do believe I am her favourite person as she can spot me a mile off and greets me with the biggest of smiles. 

Recently, myself and my husband have been bickering. He works full time and also works extra shifts to earn us more money while I care for our daughter 24/7 (including all of the night wakings). My husband’s states that he is stressed, and thought that things would be different by now and that I would have recovered. 
I know full well that the journey to recovery is a long and rocky road, filled with a lot of setbacks and potentially relapse. 

I don’t know how to make him understand how I’m feeling, I often hide my bad days and don’t really discuss my thoughts and feelings with him through fear of adding additional stress. He also states that he is really tired, and although I do appreciate the amount that he works, he appears to disregard that raising a child is also a full time job, and I’m waking up through the night with our daughter while he gets a full nights rest.

587,"Terribly toxic thoughts of leaving my husband and my 4 week old baby because they are better off without me.

Out of the week I will be great for like 2 days then have 2 bad days. When it’s bad I seem to forget the good and when it’s good I can’t seem to remember the bad.

I planned a natural homebirth, got hypertension and all plans out the window. Breast feeding didn’t work he wouldn’t latch and I’ve been to two lactation consultants and had him checked for ties.
I do great to make 1.5 oz breast milk a pumping so not no where near enough.
I am not enough.

He cries and dad can fix it, I get over why and cry myself. 

I want to go back to work full time NOW and have him stay home. He always gets mad and quits jobs, I love my career. I can’t do this mom stuff worth a shit.
All my dreams turned in to nightmares. I wanted to be a stay at home mom and I’ve changed my mind on that too.

I’ve been crying and laying in the bathroom floor all day while my husband is being fantastic with my perfect baby boy and I can’t appreciate anything 

I stress so hard about money and my nice nice savings account is now drained to almost living pay check to pay check and I just can’t seem to shake all my worries.

Husband quit his job even though he did find one and starts monday, he always does this randomly. I don’t want him miserable at work but it’s so stressful for me never feeling security

I am the only child so I never had to deal with sibling crying all the time or any noise in the house which makes me wonder if it’s just a feeling I am not used to (my baby crying).

604,"I’m 4 weeks pp and struggling. This is my second baby and after an unsuccessful breastfeeding journey with my first I absolutely had my heart set on nursing my second. It hasn’t worked out, for a bunch of reasons (interference by doctors in hospitals forcing us to supplement with formula due to low blood sugar, a uterine infection at 8 days pp which resulted in me getting very ill for a week, and a boisterous 2 year old that needs a lot of love and attention - which I chose over pumping). 

I have so many regrets. Why didn’t I get a hands free pump so I could pump more in the earlier days when we had to supplement with formula? Why didn’t I learn about the potential of low blood sugar complications and what that could mean for feeding, when I knew my baby was going to be large for gestational age. Maybe I did have gestational diabetes even though the test said I didn’t, should I have requested a second one later into my third trimester? I can’t stop going over all the scenarios and every time I see someone breastfeeding or a tiktok of a mum with over supply, tears begin to well up. 

I need to move on, how do I forgive myself? How do I move past the guilt and feeling like an absolute failure for not being able to do this most basic thing. It’s just embarrassing.

My pregnancy was not too bad, I had horrible hyperemesis and had preeclampsia  the very end of my pregnancy and posteclampsia. I had a c-section with my mother with me, then was immediately alone with my son. I barely slept for 5 days before baby blues hit. I was crying at the drop of a hat. At one point I cried because I saw a tree. I was exhausted and my son would be wide awake from 11pm to 3am every night. I was struggling as I didn’t have help. After the first month past things got easier. I lucky out immensely. He started sleeping through the night at 1 month. Our sleep regressions have been minimal. He eats well. He has CMPA and reflux, but all in all he is so good. He isn’t a crier, he longs just hanging out. Super chill. It wasn’t until right before the 5 month mark that I started to go down a dark road, it felt like the edges of my sanity were starting to fray. I knew what was happening and I could see I was being overly emotional and all over the place. Still no one said anything to me, but then again almost everyone pulled away from me. It wasn’t until a couple weeks later that I put the pieces together that it was PPD. I went to the doctors and got meds and started them right away, it was night and day.
When I talked to the people who were around me they went “ya we saw it, you stopped doing stuff for us”. Which was a whole other blow that I had to take. People only paid attention because I stopped doing things for them?

I have a 2yo LG abs a 11mo LB. He's the sweetest baby most of the time but very clingy and whiny, my first was clingy but nowhere near as whiny. I hate to say it but it literally makes me so angry and overwhelmed when he's whinging and climbing on me of following me around. 

I've suffered with my temper as well as depression and anxiety since being a small child and have had lots of therapy and meds in adolescence and adulthood. I get SO overwhelmed so quickly and easily. Now with two small children I am constantly on the edge. Always touched out and overstimulated. 

I feel so fucking awful. I've never screamed like that with ny little girl but I've got such a short fuse when it comes to my boy. I feel so ashamed and awful.

I’m a 29-year-old first-time mom, and this past year has been the hardest of my life. My first pregnancy was high-risk, and I went through it alone because my child’s father didn’t want to be involved. Despite almost losing my baby, by the grace of God, he made it out healthy.

But just four days after giving birth (four weeks early), I lost my grandmother, who I was extremely close to—right before my birthday. Then, only two days later, I lost my brother to a blood clot in his lungs.

The grief and stress have been unbearable. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum anxiety (PPA). I started on Zoloft, but the side effects made things worse, and my doctor switched me to Lexapro. Now, I feel trapped in my own body.

It feels like no one cares—my job, my friends, even my family. I’m at a breaking point. I don’t know how to keep going, and I feel so alone in all of this.

I just want my son to be loved and cared for, but I feel like I’m failing him. I’m desperate for advice, encouragement, or just someone to remind me that things can get better.

Very long story short, the relationship was extremely toxic after that. He didn't want our baby and blamed me for it. He was very controlling and wouldn't let me get a job because he didn't trust me around other guys. He lost his job, though, and refused to get another. So we struggled for food and eventually lost our apartment. I finally ate my pride and just moved back in with my mom. We broke up a few days after I had a 28 hour induced labor for preeclampsia and then a c-section with semi-failed anesthesia, which I also hemorrhaged during. Right now I, embarrassingly, rely on my parents. I'm struggling to get childcare so I can go back to work since nobody can watch my child for long enough. I'm struggling to get a license because nobody has time to teach me. I have one friend who lives states away from me. I am not in the right living situation to be comfortable dating again.

I'm not trying to say that all those mothers with happy relationships and their own homes don't have issues, because I understand that they do, but I just wish I could live some of their life. I want my own home. I want to be in a happy and healthy relationship. But now I don't know if I'll ever be able to even trust another man because my ex hurt me so badly.

668,"So I'm a young-ish mum, I'm 20 and have a 6 month old baby girl. 
I've been struggling with PPD and PPA since giving birth, I've been diagnosed by a professional yet still the only ones who seem to take me seriously on that are my mum and husband. 
I have a traumatic birth, so much so that just going near hospitals will now trigger panic attacks.

[Birth Experience]
I had to have an induced labour as my daughter was overdue by 4 days, however just minutes after my induction I went into labour. The night nurses were insistent that I wasn't in labour as they not long started the induction and it was just normal contractions, that I wouldn't recognise labour as I was a first time mom. I was left on the ward by myself for hours, screaming in pain, eventually I started noticing there was severe blood loss and since no one was answering the call button by my bed I had to try walk to their office, resulting in my collapsing on the floor from exhaustion. Still the night nurses wouldn't take me seriously, calling me dramatic and yelling at me to stop crying. 
3 hours later the day nurse, bless her heart, came in for her shift and rushed in to check on me after hearing me screaming for help. My daughter was crowning then and since I had been in active labour for over 7 hours by this point I was exhausted and couldn't push her out. I was put onto a wheelchair, and pushed down a freezing cold corridor to the delivery ward where I was told I couldn't have a c-section as she was already coming out, however I also couldn't have ant painkillers as I had to focus on pushing my daughter out. By some miracle I managed to push her out, but I don't recall anything after that until the next morning as I had fallen unconscious from the blood loss and my heart had momentarily stopped. 
I had my friend and partner in the room with me and they said that the room went deathly silent after the heart monitor showed I had no pulse and then multiple midwives rushed in and began doing CPR and using defibrillators. Meanwhile another midwife was handling my daughter who had been born with her cord wrapped around her neck and wasn't breathing. 
I'm forever grateful to the midwife who saved my daughter, and the midwives who saved me. 
After being sent home to recover my husband and mum urged me to report the night staff for medical negligence but after months of trying to get justice for what happened to me and my daughter the hospital still didn't take me seriously, blaming the situation on me claiming that I should've been more assertive. 

My family are all aware of this but the frequently blame me saying that it was my fault for having a baby at such a young age anyway, and that I should've had an abortion. My husband and I always wanted to start a family and were delighted when we found out I was pregnant, and we followed the pregnancy through as there was 0 complications, both me and my baby were incredibly healthy. 
Despite them all blaming it on me, they are still pushing me and husband to try for another baby so my daughter has a playmate, not caring about the trauma childbirth has put me through. 

I really don't know what to do anymore, I love my daughter so much but sometimes I just feel miserable, unable to motivate myself to do anything. I'm lucky to have my husband here really as he is a big help but even still we struggle, some days I'm fine and able to go out and do fun things, but most days it feels like I'm just stuck in a void. 
I've tried going to therapy to help but the therapists I've been to were horrible, eventually saying that they couldn't have me as a client as they found me intolerable as it was my fault the entire experience happened to begin with.
I'm running out of ways to cope, and I'm scared of losing my daughter because of this.

709,8 weeks pp and I feel like each day I’m getting worse. Sometimes I don’t even know who I am. I feel lost and disconnected with my partner. I can’t even find joy in anything. I feel angry and resentment for no reason. I look in the mirror and I don't recognize myself. I feel like a stranger in my own body. I look at my partner or friends and family and they all seem like strangers to me. I don't feel connected to anyone and I feel like I have to pretend. Is it normal to feel like everyone is a stranger to you even if you've known them for years? I mean I feel like a stranger to myself. I don't know who I am or even who I was. Things I use to enjoy don't make me feel better. I can't find enjoyment in anything.

The world spins on. Well meaning people ask about more children and comment on the way my body looks. What they don’t know is that I didn’t know going into the hospital that day it would be the last time i was ever pregnant.  That a calm delivery would turn into a life saving hysterectomy. That depression, anxiety and anger would color my first year with my child. The holidays would feel scary and again worries that I was being selfish oscillating with feelings of anger that people were unaware of my experience. That returning to work at the hospital would turn into heart wrenching trigger that I should feel grateful that my daughter is healthy. The sadness felt unjustified. The shoulds swirled in my brain. This is nothing like I expected. Like so many families, we needed my salary and health benefits. Just keep going. Push it down, with time the memories will fade. Memories would pop up “Am I going to die?” The look of panic on my care teams faces. But you are fine, your daughter is healthy… keep moving forward. Be gracious, be thankful, be appreciative. What’s the most polite way to heal?  You can feel sad, just not too sad and make sure your sadness doesn’t make anyone uncomfortable. Pull yourself together. Don’t make too much of a fuss, just keep going. Did you write your thank you notes? You don’t want to be an attention seeker, deal with this in therapy. Keep it to yourself! Be polite and gracious, they are well meaning. What’s the most polite way to grieve? It’s been a year, it’s time to move forward. Don’t hurt their feelings, sit on your seat of nails with a grateful smile. “My friend also went through what you did, they used a surrogate for their second child.

722,"Hey.

I’m 29 years old and have four small children (ages 7, 4, 2, and 5 months). I had pretty easy recoveries with my first three babies, but since having my youngest son, I have been in a mental health crisis.

For me, it started within a month of my son being born but I didn’t realize what was happening until a few months postpartum, and I delayed reaching out for help.

My PPD/PPA is marked my extreme sadness and anxiousness, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, panic attacks that sometimes last for hours, difficulty eating, intrusive (sometimes suicidal) thoughts, and hopelessness.

The depression and anxiety has been exacerbated by several life stressors. My husband has been battling cancer for two years, and he was recently diagnosed with a second (unrelated) cancer. Also, our son was born with a heart defect and stayed in NICU for 9 days and at my 6 week postpartum checkup, I found out I was in the “precancerous stages” of cervical cancer.

These have been the darkest days of my life. I’ve lost 20lbs in two months. I’m blessed to have a strong support system from my husband, parents and older sister. I’m currently meeting with a therapist weekly and taking medication (Lexapro) to aid in my recovery.

I thought I would be better by now. It feels like the mental anguish is stretching on without end. Between the feelings of hopelessness, the panic attacks, and the intrusive thoughts, most days it feels like I’m all alone and things won’t ever get better.

I’m thankful I found this forum.

Thank you for taking the time to hear a little of my story. I hope to make connections with other women who have made it through to the other side. �",,"hey

I am not part of y'all community, but recently my friend and his partner had a baby. She had the baby a month early, and then the mom had to stay in the hospital for 8 days after the birth. 
She had preeclampsia. 
Fast-forward.. the baby is a month old. 
My friend reaches out to give me an update on the whole family..
She's depressed, again. He mentions that she wants to kill herself. That she would rather work than take care of the kids, but they cannot financially afford that because she also doesn't really want to work. 

She struggled when their first child was born 5 years ago. This time i feel as if she is struggling more. 
It pains me to hear that my friend is struggling and doesn't know how to help his partner. She isn't communicating with him and telling him what she needs. She isn't reaching out for any mental health services. 

So i guess i am asking if anyone in the Columbus, OH area knows of any good postpartum care resources that i can forward to them?
Or any good care resources in general to help her and the family.

Ever since having my baby I feel like I no longer matter. Aside from my husband and maybe two of my friends, all communication is about the baby.

My in-laws are the “come over if you need us” kind of people, and my mother in law is 12 hours away. She would help if she could, but distance makes that understandably difficult.

My husband had only a week of paternity leave, and it was all spent while we were hospitalized. I’m alone all day in the house tending to my newborn without any support. I feel like my own basic needs (bathing, eating) are falling to the wayside because of this lack of support. I’m scared to welcome people into my home because the housekeeping and self care have been so lax and I don’t want to be judged for it.

I just have to believe that it gets better.

781,"My daughter is nearly 6months old. I've been diagnosed with post partum depression a few weeks after delivery but I was already seen by a therapist and a psychiatrist for a personality disorder that was under control so we were able to detect it really early on. I was EP so it was not possible to give me any medication but with therapy I was getting better... Then I started working again. I'm the sole provider of the household and I was still EP when I went back to work nearly 2 months ago. I decided to stop a few weeks ago because it was too much and I felt I was getting worse again and I needed to be put under medication.

The thing is stopping EP took a few weeks and my state deteriorated really quickly.. I had an appointment with the therapist last week and he talked about hospitalisation... I know I cannot keep going like that, because I'm really close to doing something bad I know that but I feel so guilty for not being able to do it all. I'm scaring my husband but also he's not feeling well himself so he's struggling to help me, and so I feel even more guilty. I just don't have any energy anymore, I'm constantly on edge, anxious like crazy and sometime I just can't anymore and I really really want to hurt myself. No one knows this but I've wrote a goodbye letter and counted the pills that I have to see if they were enough.. I haven't decided anything yet but I know when I do it'll be ready. I'm really scarring myself.

824,"Going back to work is making my postpartum depression a lot worse. My job got changed right before I went on leave to one that has a lot more responsibilities than what I had before, and it’s stressing me out. 

My DH is usually very loving and kind, but he doesn’t understand anything about my parenting style and goals. Even before we got married I said I wanted to have kids and homeschool them. Eventually I compromised by saying I would go back to work when our child is able to be safe at daycare. I’m traumatized by stories of daycare workers abusing babies. It’s my biggest fear. I said I wanted to stay home for six more months on unpaid leave (my job has to offer me back a position), and he said no because he doesn’t want to pay 600 USD a month for insurance. Instead he wants his mom and other family members to watch the baby while I go to work. As an added bonus, his mom doesn’t like me and doesn’t feel strong enough to lift the baby. Why tf should I leave the baby with her? 

If I quit my job, he said he won’t buy me anything. I’m not expecting steak dinners, but it hurts to know he thinks it’s okay to say I can never go get a Starbucks or get my roots done every couple of months. He pretty much said he wouldn’t let me make a single financial decision in the household if I quit. Not even food. 

I could get it if he didn’t have the money, but he literally makes 3x more than I do. It makes me mad he won’t even ask his job what insurance would be if I quit my job. If I tell people I’m struggling I just get told “there’s no need for you to be depressed. Most people have it worse than you”. 

Now I also have my mom telling me I’m a bad mom because I’m “putting my job above my kids” and that she didn’t raise me to be that way. She knows that I didn’t choose going back so it just feels worse. I feel like I can’t win and I’ll need a lot of mental help when I go back to work because I don’t feel stable anymore.

842,"Since my son was born I have spent the last 4.5 months trying my best to be perfect and to make his world perfect. I went dairy free and limit my soy intake because I sensed he may have a cow milk protein allergy. I stopped working so that I could give him my full attention. Every minute of every waking day I spend making sure he is happy and healthy. I haven’t had fun or me time in so long that I forgot what it feels like to let go a little bit.

Last weekend my family had a family reunion and I drank alcohol. I dumped a few rounds of pumped milk because I knew that it would be compromised milk. However, while drinking I started hitting my sisters nicotine vape pretty heavily over the course of the weekend. Always when he was asleep and outside of the house. It never NEVER crossed my mind that nicotine enters breast milk. I didn’t even think twice about it. Not once. So for three whole days I hit this e cig and was feeding my son, some of it was dumped I’m not sure how much of the nicotine infused milk was dumped. I produce a lot so we’ve been feeding him milk from that time frame over the week.

This week we noticed his sleep take a serious turn for the worse. Irritability and screaming and just acting very weird. He hasn’t pooped in a while so that’s what I thought it was. It was only a few days ago that I had the realization to google nicotine in breastmilk and discovered what a piece of shit I am.

I can’t even look in the mirror. I can’t look at him. I can’t move on. My husband is urging me to try to forgive myself and move on but I can’t. Because who does this to an innocent helpless baby who needed me? He more than likely developed a small addiction and is withdrawing from it, he can’t sleep anymore without being held all night long.

873,"LO is almost 6 weeks now, she was born at 36 weeks so we had challenges with latching since she was so small and also had jaundice till she was almost 3 weeks old. I almost exclusively pump on a schedule and only latch now if baby screams while i’m heating up milk or seems to want more after a bottle. 

Let me cut this short, I feel like me dying would be easier than this. I want to die. My breasts feels like it’s thrashed with pain as I write this because LO took was longer to finish a bottle and i’m now an hour late to pump on my schedule, probably a couple of plugged ducts there too. 

Usually I can count on my husband with his night shift so I can at least get uninterrupted sleep around 12-4am. But last night we had a fight because he was delaying his shift, was supposed to get LO from around 8ish but he took a nap and i let him until about 10pm. I woke him up as it was time for baby’s next feed and she was waking up. He got mad at me for not helping him warm the milk first before waking him up and questioning if i’m THAT tired that I couldn’t help with that one thing. I WAS WITH BABY THE WHOLE DAY from usually 4am and juggling pumping and her feeding schedule and diaper change and cleaning out bottles and pump parts in between trying to make the house look decent. 


I got so pissed and a part of me also feels guilty to my baby. It made me feel like a bad mom for needing a break and feeling exhausted. So I took her for the night and she’s been with me ever since. It’s now 9pm the following day. I haven’t gotten more than 2 hours of sleep at a time, my boobs are on fire and leaking everywhere, haven’t showered, only ate a cup of instant noodles and loaded up on caffeine. I guess if he wanted to help with whatever he wants at his own timing then fuck it. I’m not going to ask for help if he doesn’t care or have enough empathy or common sense to. Not too sure why moms taking care of her own child is just that but dads doing the same is called “helping”.

I don’t think I can take it anymore, this wasn’t what I imagined motherhood would look like. I don’t think i’ll ever want another. This has been hard but my maternity leave ends in about 2 months and I dread trying to juggle work and all of this when it’s time. I love my daughter to death, she’s the sweetest. And I, again, feel guilty for thinking of every suicide scenarios i can think of while caring for her all day today.

I’m so depressed, and I’m already on antidepressants and doing therapy. This week I’ve started having sui*id*l thoughts and feel so much worse.

883,"My boyfriend (38m) is a great guy, he’s a very present and engaging father and he works hard and takes care of most of the expenses. 

I (30F) am on disability and not working, saving the little money I get and I take care of most of the baby care. 

When my boyfriend does have free time, he works on my old Jeep, which I didn’t ask him to, but I guess it’s nice. It’s just, I have so many things to do that I would appreciate a hand with—if he’s not going to help with chores at least take the baby and let me do it in peace. 

And here’s the thing, he’ll do it—but I either have to ask or be pushed to point of exhaustion/rage for him to help out. Why can’t he just help out without me asking?

He had a migraine the other day—I removed the baby from disturbing him, I brought him water, electrolytes, coffee and oatmeal without him asking—he slept in until 3pm. I even felt bad about how hard he works and how poorly he was feeling that I bought him some stuff from REI as a thank you gift. 

It’s just annoying that I feel like the thoughtfulness isn’t reciprocated, but I’m not sure I’m in a place to complain about it because it’s not like he doesn’t do anything or he’s a lowlife—he’s just not very thoughtful. 

When he leaves the house, it feels like a clamp off of my head and I can breathe because at least there isn’t another body in the house doing nothing to help with the things that need to get done. 

Like, when I ask for help with laundry, he’ll just bring down the dirty laundry and toss it in the laundry room. Doesn’t start it, doesn’t even put it in the washer. 

It’s just little things like that that irk me. ",,"boyfriend great guy present engage father work hard take care expense

Edit: Dr suggested water after feeds if we suspect baby is dehydrated. The Dr said she will take what she needs if it'd after food, personally I'm not too sure on this.
I think she's teething from the amount of drool coming out of her mouth and she's been a bit grizzly, just trying to keep getting breast milk and formula into her.

897,"I, 23f, gave birth to my daughter almost 6 weeks ago now. Prior to pregnancy I was diagnosed with BPD(borderline personality disorder) and have been trying to manage that for years. It made me high risk for PPD which I have now been diagnosed with and it's not a good combination. Just for some clarification first.

Things have gotten really hard for me, especially the last few weeks. My fiance doesn't help with our daughter or with cleaning when he's home from work. He doesn't get up through the night, change her, hold her, feed her, ect. She's solely my responsibility and the house has been too(He leaves dishes, clothes, garbage everywhere) and it's made me extremely frustrated. The frustration mixed with the exhaustion and mental drain has made me very easy to lash out. I'm scared I'm going to hurt my daughter. There's been moments where she won't stop crying no matter what I do and I've been a little too rough with her, or yelling at her. I've genuinely been thinking about putting her up for adoption because I'm so scared I'll lash out at her and seriously hurt her. I know my fiance won't want to but I don't feel like I can safely do this anymore. If I had more help from him with her at the very least then maybe I could because I could sleep more and have a few moments to myself but thats not the case. He feels that he brings in the money and drives when we run errands that he doesn't need to do more. I love my daughter so much and I want what's best for her... and I feel like I'm not what's best for her. I'm so lost..
