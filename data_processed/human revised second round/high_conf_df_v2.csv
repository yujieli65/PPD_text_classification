741,"TRIGGER WARNING: mention of loss

My marriage feels like it’s sinking. I’m 2 months post partum today. I have 4 daughters, ages 5, 3, 2, and the 2 month old. I have had postpartum depression with all of my pregnancies, including my first pregnancy where I had a stillbirth at 38 weeks. I have noticed symptoms I dealt with previously making an appearance again. I feel like when my house is a mess I can’t breathe. I feel like I can’t do anything without my newborn. I really wanted to be able to breastfeed this time. With my first, I could never get her to latch and didn’t have any idea how to pump at the time. With my second, I breastfed her and bottle fed her breastmilk until 8 months when my supply disappeared because I was pregnant with our third. With my third, I don’t even know how long I tried breastfeeding her before I gave up for my mental health. She was my only delivery without an epidural, and unfortunately I think because it was so traumatic for me, I didn’t bond with her as much and that affected my breastfeeding journey with her. My newest has been difficult to even try to get her to take a bottle with breastmilk in it. She only wants boob. She won’t take a pacifier. I’m not against formula at all, but it breaks my heart to even think about stopping. But I also feel relief when I think about stopping. I feel worthless. My husband has always treated me wonderfully. He’s always there for me when I need him. But I know I’ve been nasty to him lately, but I feel like it’s not me talking. I feel like my family would be better off without me. I don’t want to take antidepressants because I dont believe in medications. I know there’s people who believe that’s the only way to get through things, but I know there has to be another option for me? I feel like I’m single handedly tearing my family apart. My 5 year old went to school and was best friends with a little girl whose parents were divorced and she told me today that she doesn’t want our family to end up like that girls family. � I broke down right then and there. We try so hard to not have arguments in front of our daughters but she was listening when we didn’t know she was. I just feel like all I feel lately is rage or guilt. I don’t know how to feel happy.

Regardless of all the crying I luckily have begun to love every moment with him. This definitely was not the case until very recently. It was quite the opposite I thought my baby HATED me. But now I’m struggling deeply with ppd. Before getting pregnant I struggled with my mental health… I always have since I was a teenager. I’ve been hospitalized a few times and medicated on and off for years. I have shared with my boyfriend that im struggling a lot right now and he seems like he understands but then responds with “well, this was your dream to have a baby… so find a way to be happy” I continuously tell him that I’m allowed to struggle even though I wanted our child. Sometimes he seems understanding and then other days he seems mad at me for being so sad. He often tries to tell me that he’s having an equally hard time. But after carrying our child for 41 weeks and 3 days in my body having a 30+ hour labor and then going into septic shock from an infection from the delivery with coming to terms that I’m 25 and my body looks awful and my hair is falling out with a baby screaming 24/7…. Oh and not to mention exclusively breast pumping… I feel like things might be a little bit harder for me 
He works at a restaurant full time and I’m home with the baby alone. He also told me he’s starting to resent me for not being intimate with him. I have a uterine prolapse and I’m really uncomfortable in my own body right now which I’ve communicated but yet he still finds a way to pressure me or make me feel badly. I’m starting to resent him and feel like I made a mistake having a child with him. He’s by no means the only problem here… I struggle with rage right now and often scream at him or throw a dish or punch the wall… but he doesn’t seem to understand why I’m so broken on the inside right now

So a little recovery story 
After I had my son I was so depressed and I didn’t wanna take care of him, I was always mad at him, and I really just felt like I was baby sitting someone else’s baby.

Back story I had a traumatic emergency C-section and most people know how that goes. You lose 30 minutes of a golden hour it’s traumatic sometimes and just not a good time 

I spoke with my spouse about this and about how I felt our son hated me and I could tell and I feel like he wasn’t even mine 
My spouse was so loving and caring for my physical needs after the birth cooking, cleaning, helping me get dressed but he doesn’t really understand how to mentally be there for someone. He had a lot of love but not in the right way for my mentality.

Well I kind of forced myself on my son and always told him I loved him and would snuggle him but it didn’t get better till about 3 months ago. Honestly I’m just on a rant and I want other moms to know it gets better and I believe in you.

I love my son so much I know he loves me and I don’t feel like I’m baby sitting someone else’s kid anymore. It gets better. I promise.

I just wanna get this off my chest once again tonight. I know I have been posting on Reddit about the same issue but who cares, I am so desperate for a little of care from people I do not know.

To keep it short, I just gave birth four months ago. I caught my partner cheating on me two months postpartum. He said sorry but never really done anything to help me get through the pain. We reconciled. But I haven’t really felt some sort of genuine apology from him.

I have been asking me to just atleast consider my feelings for our baby. Especially, I am the sole physically present parent for him. Knowing he is living 10 hours away from us due to his nature of work. I have been really understanding but I exploded for the nth time again tonight because I have learnt that he followed another woman’s alter account using his alter account which I find it bullshit.

I confronted him and he told me it’s just a woman he has known for a long time but I know that is not the case. Should it just be that, why follow using an alter account? And the fact that he has been one of the first people to be followed by the woman.

Now, we got into another argument and I just really do not know anymore. I feel like I am dealing with someone who cannot even change even just at least for the child involved.",,"

He did those before a couple times, but because they were rare I can’t be sure if those weren’t just gassy or pooping smiles.
