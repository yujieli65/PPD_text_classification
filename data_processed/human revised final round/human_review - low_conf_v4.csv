My husband and I experienced some steep lows before successfully conceiving - I still couldn’t believe I was pregnant until he was placed on my belly.

SIDS is also a concern of mine and I’m finding it hard to sleep (when I briefly can).

I ended up having an emergency c-section and I'm learning to accept my newly acquired scar and how my birth didn't go how I wanted it at all. I did my makeup and put on a dress for the first time pp and felt like fraud just so ugly, I'm so mad at my husband for doing this to me even tho I wanted a baby just as much as him. I've been lying on those little questionnaires that they give you at check ups but I feel ok somedays and absolutely horrible others and I'm wondering if I should get medical help or if it will level out on its own. 
 

 I'm really really upset that I had to have a c-section and everyone around me is telling me to just be grateful to have a healthy baby which i am! It's just so hard to have nothing go the way I imagined it. Whenever I try to talk to my husband about how hard caring for our baby is and how I'm having a hard time he just says ""you knew parenting wasn't going to be easy"". It makes me livid when he says that shit. He's still on paternity leave as well but he spends his days sleeping and playing computer games for the most part. He'll watch the baby for about an hour or 2 at a time once or twice a day. So I feel like he doesn't understand what I'm going through at all I'm watching the baby at least 20 hours a day and he acts like those few hours are so hard on him.

 So I worked in childcare prior to having my baby and finding a nanny/daycare job that’s okay with my daughter tagging along has been more than a struggle.

20,295,295,295,"Firstly, I’m a second time father. My current gf and I had our first child (my second) 6 months ago. We have our issues of course, but the last 6 months I’ve felt my gf slip away. I now see how I’ve frustrated her with trying to help solve problems and always be the “solutions guy” even when not asked. The sad part is, we used to have really open, vulnerable communication at the beginning of our two year relationship, but as of late, attempting even that has been met with what I can only describe as a sullen teenager’s response (aggression, dismissal, annoyance) from my partner. Now I realize this is a very delicate period but things have progressively worsened, coming to a head about a month ago in an argument in which we both screamed at each other. This is definitely not the norm for us but since then it’s effectively been two individuals coexisting in a home. I tried to hug her a week later and the look of disdain I received was gut wrenching.  
 

 Fast forward to Monday and she completely moved out while I was at work, taking almost everything we collectively (I mostly) have provided for our baby. She did this under the guise of “needing space” and it being “temporary” but the actions and way she went about this don’t give me reassurance. She seems to be all over the place emotionally and if I so much as mention that (out of concern, not criticism), while I/we certainly have issues, postpartum feelings may be amplifying or intensifying the negative feelings towards me, she flat out scoffs in my face that she’s “fine.” The thing is I’ve known her long enough to see that she’s anything but fine. She under eats, doesn’t get good sleep, has given up on her appearance (not that I personally care, but that’s something she prides herself deeply on), quit working out or trying (once again, not a mandate from me, but something she was so absorbed with throughout the pregnancy and right after the birth- getting back on that horse). She even started drinking nightly 5 months postpartum, which we’ve never done as long as I’ve known her. When I delicately asked “is this a thing now” she snapped at me as if I was blowing it all out of proportion. It’s at the point where if I have any concern and voice it, even trying to be as tactful as possible, I’m met with flat out denial/refusal to see that something is off.
 

 This also isn’t a situation where she’s carrying the load, although it seems like she feels that way. I do all cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, and am extremely hands on with the kids (I do virtually all tasks pertaining to my older and split many of the baby tasks). I’ve always told her to ask for help if she needs a break but she never once has. Something else strange that started happening is every time I’d take our baby to the changing station to change her, my gf would be standing over my shoulder, and by the time I’m putting the clean diaper on, she’s putting her hands in and taking over the task (4 hands for one diaper is too many cooks in the kitchen). I don’t understand if this is a trust in my parenting abilities issue but I’m confused by it and have even asked why she does that as I have it under control. Not sure if this is a maternal instinct or if I’m over analyzing but it’s happened probably a dozen times.
 

 I’m worried that she’s now making rash decisions in the midst of an already extremely difficult time and I have no idea what to do. She’s now living alone in a run down house compared to our house we bought together and built our life in, leaving me and my daughter (effectively her step daughter- even calls her “mom”) behind very confused. I can own my part in frustration and not handling the sudden change in her demeanor and sudden non-communication well, but I can’t help but feel like this “one month of space” is really just a protracted break up. Can I save this? Or it best to focus on my new reality bc fighting/working towards reconciliation/healing only a lost cause? Any advice would be extremely appreciated.
  
 UPDATE: She has fully moved out which is painful but the hard part for me that I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to wrap my head around is that I’ve been positioned as an adversary/antagonist. Sucks that you can provide and give without getting in return only to be thrown under the bus but maybe there’s a lesson in there for me somewhere, not clear what that is.",,"firstly second time father  current gf first child second  month ago  issue course last  month feel gf slip away  see frustrate try help solve problem always solution guy even ask  sad part use really open vulnerable communication beginning two year relationship late attempt even meet describe sullen teenager response aggression dismissal annoyance partner  realize delicate period thing progressively worsen come head month ago argument scream  definitely norm we since effectively two individual coexist home  try hug week later look disdain receive gut wrench

I love my daughter more than anything in the world and have never questioned my bond with her. The rage comes in more with my husband, who is overall a great partner. I really hate his mom, who just tries to help but in doing that oversteps boundaries. She came to the hospital uninvited and was upset they kicked her out of the room due to my medical emergency. She did not once ask how I was doing and still has never asked about me. My husband and I have talked about this and he regrets not standing up for me in these moments but playing devils advocate, we are new parents and everything was happening so quickly. He has really shown so much grace and understanding with my issues with his mom and has not pushed me. But every time he goes to see her with our daughter I get ANGRY. Like could do harm angry. And it’ll stick for days and days. I’ll ignore him because I’m so upset and that’s not fair. I have also been depressed.

  For context, my step dad and I have always had a slightly rocky relationship. I was abused by my bio dad growing up, and therefore had trust issues in regards to new men entering my life. However, my step dad, who I usually refer to as my real dad, was patient and won me over with time. I grew to trust him, but we still have clashing personalities and different ways of expressing ourselves, which often leads to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. We had gotten pretty close, and even talked about getting matching tattoos, because despite our disagreements, we still loved each other very much. I love my dad, and I know he loves his grandson, but lately it feels like he doesn't like me at all. 
  Ever since my son was born, it feels like my dad doesn't have anything nice to say to me unless he's called out for being rude. He questions everything I do in regards to my son, and frequently gives me conflicting critiques. For example, if I go and grab my son as soon as he cries, I'm called an over bearing helicopter mom, but if I let him cry for a bit at a time that's inconvenient for my dad, like when hes watching tv, then he acts like I'm being neglectful. 
  One time, he chewed me out for not having all of the baby's bottles washed at the time, and instead washing one as I needed it. He got really fired up about this, and his tone made it seem like I was neglecting my baby. I could go on, but I'd be here all day. 
  He doesn't even seem interested in talking to me anymore. I ask him how his day was, and get vague, one word answers. I try to tell him jokes, or tell him about my day, or something I read, and he doesn't respond at all. Sometimes there are nice moments where things between us feel the way they used to, but they are often fleeting, and far between. 
  I can't tell if I'm being dramatic, or over thinking things though. I admit that my past traumas still tend to cloud my judgment when it comes to my dad, even after years of therapy, and I don't feel like I'm in the right state of mind these days. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to keep it together for the sake of my son, and I make sure he's well taken care of. He's one of the only things that makes me smile these days, and I love him so much. He's very happy, and healthy, and he smiles so big whenever he sees me, which let's me know I'm doing a good job as a mom, even when my dad makes me doubt that.
  I would like to talk to my mom about it, but her and I don't get much time alone these days, and I don't want to cause tension between her and my dad, especially if I'm just over reacting. Her and I are incredibly close, and have only gotten closer since I got pregnant. I think she would listen to me, and be supportive, but I don't want her to feel like she's caught between me and her husband.
  Honestly, I don't know what I'm hoping for here, I guess I just needed to vent, and feel like I don't have much of another outlet right now. Maybe I need some impartial advice, or just someone to tell me if I'm being dramatic or not. Thank you for anyone who read this far, I appreciate the ability to just get this all off of my chest.
 

 UPDATE
  No one has asked for an update, but for the sake of getting everything off my chest I wanted to write one anyway. 
  I managed to find the time to talk to my mom, and first asked her if she's also noticed my dad's behavior, and she immediately confirmed that she had. This was both a relief and a disappointment, because it meant that I wasn't imagining things, but also meant that I was right about my dad not being very nice to me. My mom suggested that I talk to him and figure out what's going on, which isn't bad advice.
  The main reason I hadn't talked to my dad about it to start off with is he's not the easiest to talk to about stuff like this. He can get very defensive and stubborn, and if he feels like he's being targeted he simply shuts down and is no longer willing to hear anything I have to say. I can be the same way sometimes, which is part of where he and I end up butting heads, but I'm trying to do better. I've spent years learning those to best communicate with my dad to avoid the shut down, but the majority of my energy is going towards caring for my son, so I didn't feel like I had the energy to carefully talk with him. However, I didn't feel it was fair of me to just sit there being upset with him without talking to him about it.
  Before I got the chance though, my dad asked me about it himself. My mom had told him about what I said, which I knew she was likely to do. My mom tells my dad everything unless I ask her not to, which I honestly don't mind, and sometimes actually hope for. My dad asked why I thought he didn't like me, and I was honest and said that while we were in a good spot recently, he hadn't been very nice to me as of late.
  My dad told me that a lot of it is do to stress over things like money, and feeling like I'm taking advantage of him. I work nights so I'm home with my kid during the day, and my parents watch him at night. I thought this arrangement was working fine, but my dad wanted me to put my son in daycare. I explained that I didn't really feel comfortable with putting my baby in a daycare, and my dad was very dismissive. 
  Personally I think the whole stressed out excuse is nonsense. I'm dealing with the stresses of being a new, single mom, who's still trying to work full-time, and I haven't taken it out on anyone. The whole money things seems like a bit of an excuse to me too, especially because I've offered multiple times to help out. I acknowledge that I have a lot more disposable income than them since I'm living at home, and have said multiple times that I'm happy to help with things like bills and groceries. It's only once in a blue moon that they ask me to pay for something, and I've never said no so far. I get that they probably see this as not my problem, because I'm still considered one of the kids, but I am and adult, with a job so if they're stressed enough that my dad isn't treating me well, they should ask me for help more.
  Either way it seems to have gotten better. My dad has been treating me better, and while I do think his reason is a little ridiculous, it is nice to have an explanation for his behavior. 
  Thank you to those who commented and left suggestions. I knew that being a mom was going to be a challenge, but I wasn't prepared for this kind of conflict with my dad.

I had a pretty straightforward, quick-ish (about 12 hours) vaginal birth and although there was some pretty bad tearing, I had an epidural and didn't even feel it happening. 
 

 I just keep finding myself flashing back to being on that hospital bed in the delivery room, trying to push, everyone focused on me and yelling out instructions and reassurances. The level of exposure and vulnerability that comes with giving birth leaves me with a skin-crawling type of feeliing every time I think about it. My heart starts racing, it gets hard to breathe, and I find it difficult to focus on caring for my little girl. 
 

 Does anyone have any advice or coping skills they've found helpful when these flashbacks hit? I am currently seeing a therapist and am going to call a doctor tomorrow to see about medication, but I'm hoping there's something I can do in the meantime. I feel like it's affecting my bond with my baby and my relationship with my husband.

25,326,326,326,"How do you cope with negative thoughts that come with post partum depression. My mind keeps going back to how my husband sucks and essentially was selfish and abandoned me when I really needed him. He continues to abandon me by choosing to work a night shift even though I’ve told him I’m struggling and need help. He sleeps all day and I’m alone with the 6 month old and 2 year old. I don’t have family or friends that care. I feel alone, abandoned. I get angry at my husband and family and then I get overwhelmed and angry which spills over to my kids. I get irritable and don’t want to spend time with them because I’m already drained. I feel my husband creates a dark shadow around me. I have already tried to leave him last year but he kept harassing me and all of a sudden was father is the year wanting to see the 2 year old (6 month old wasn’t born yet) and demanding that I drop her off. I was worried he wouldn’t give her back to me so I always went along with the visits and he somehow weasels his way back into my life. Then the cycle repeats and I stupidly got pregnant again and he wanted me to abort the baby. He wasn’t supportive throughout pregnancy and left the childcare and cleaning to me of course while I was still working full time. I’ve been so depressed and tired. Then when the baby was born he sat in the chair and I had to tell him to help me. With both pregnancies I hired a doula to be there for me because I knew he wouldn’t help me. I was correct. He’s a selfish shitty person. I knew the second baby would be hard on my mental health because I knew he would be like this. And so here I am dealing with the consequences of my bad choices in choosing this stupid man. He has childhood trauma and untreated ADHD. He truly lacks empathy and has told me so. He says he only cares about me and that he “likes” the kids. I wonder if he only truly cares about me because he uses me. 
 

 Last night I sent him a series of texts about my thoughts and feelings while he was at work and he basically kept working. I told him I fantasize about the peace that would come with death. He came home and went to sleep. Just further confirms that I’m alone and he’s a piece of shit. I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to my family because they already hate him from last year when I tried to leave him. If I talk to them them I’m just proving to them that I’m unfit to be a parent by staying with him. 
 

 It’s too much effort to deal with him. I can’t rely on him yet I’m trapped with him. He also doesn’t even remember when our kids were born. He literally told me that it wasn’t a big deal to him because it wasn’t happening to him. He said he didn’t really care about the ordeal. I remember when I was in labour he didn’t try to help me. He got mad at me because he was tired.

Fast forward to the birth. Everything went pretty well until I got to 9 cm at which point his heart started to drop. I was rushed into the OR for an emergency C section but ended up vaginally delivering instead after two hours of pushing. The recovery was slow but okay. I was proud of how I could handle the sleepless nights and other challenges. Then came going back to work. I don’t know if it was the stress of going back to work or working out but all of a sudden my pelvic floor went haywire. I could no longer properly use the bathroom and no one could diagnose me.

41,440,440,440,"This was a much wanted pregnancy after IVF/a hellish journey to get here. 
 

 I am grateful for my son but honestly, when I found out the gender at 3 months pregnant, I was heartbroken; I have experienced so much male violence/SA in my life, and have been scarred by misogyny, that I just couldn’t imagine raising a son. Not to mention having an estranged relationship with my own mother, I wanted to recreate a positive mother daughter bond so badly. I have so many negative associations about teenage boys, patriarchy etc. So much of my identity revolves around being an empowered woman in an industry often dominated by men. So bringing one into the world felt really hard.
 

 The mother-son bond seems weirdly discouraged by society (see r/JUSTNOMIL). So I feel scared I’ll not have an enduring relationship with him anyway, and have no positive template for this.
 

 Everyone said I’d feel differently when the baby was here but if anything, I feel worse. I am on the verge of tears whenever I see a mother daughter relationship on TV, or walk past girly things in shops. I know it sounds shallow but it feels like a dream has gone and I’m now in scary territory.
 

 I’ve been on Zoloft for just under 2 weeks, and had therapy throughout pregnancy, but nothing is working. I feel so resentful of people who “got their preferred gender”. My baby deserves better, but I almost fear bonding with him as so many men grow up to hate their mothers that I feel downright helpless.
 

 I also feel like part of my own girlhood has died bizarrely, like I can’t even fully relate to being a woman anymore if I have borne a son. 
 

 I think going through infertility and IVF really fucked up my brain and made me covet anything others have that I don’t, which has now applied itself to gender.

50,502,502,502,"Hi so quick question and long post. 
 

 I had a baby in August and since then my body is not the same. I need to know if anyone has experienced something similar? 
 

 A backstory: 
 About 7 weeks postpartum I was experiencing a light green discharge. Went to the dr. And was told I was fine. Did a bacterial panel, STD panel and all was clear. I went back a month later with persistent green discharge and now pelvic/uterine pain and cramping. Was told I’m fine and it’s a physiological change to pregnancy after further bacterial testing came back negative. 
 I felt like something was wrong and got a second opinion. I was placed on prophylactic antibiotics for the green discharge and an US was ordered. Finally, this month (4 months later) I was told again I’m fine. I did a transvaginal US along with another bacteria/STD panel and everything looks clear with the exception of some trace free fluid in my uterine cavity. Which my doctor told me could pose no issue since my US was clear otherwise. 
 The only issue is I still have the discharge and pain. The discharge happens at least once every three days. And pain is daily. I would describe it as varying from sharp to dull to cramping to achey. Nothing triggers it and it’s affecting me working out, having sex etc. 
 

 I should add I had ICP and discovered to have preeclampsia at my birth that went undiagnosed due to hidden symptoms. Otherwise healthy pregnancy and baby. 
 

 I just feel sort of hopeless since I’ve been cleared from a gynecological standpoint and was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar after having their own baby. 
 This is my first baby. I was completely healthy otherwise. So to be struggling with this postpartum is really bothering me. I would also be lying if I said I wasn’t experiencing any anxiety about these persistent symptoms when it came to the discharge and pain. I just want to know if anyone has experienced the same thing and got better over time?

 This was about 5 weeks ago. I knew I was miscarrying because while passing some blood and tissue on the toilet, I started cramping horribly. I called for my bf and fainted in his arms shortly after. I was out for about 10 secs. I went to the hospital, where they confirmed I was miscarrying, gave me fluids, told me to take Advil and reach out to my obgyn.
 My obgyn told me to take ibeprofen for pain while I passed all the tissue/miscarried at home. 2 weeks go by and I now have a follow up. my doctor saw me for an ultrasound to check everything had passed, and it hadn’t. I was scheduled for a D&C but had to wait a week to get an appointment due to the holidays. I finally have a D&C.

 My baby boy is almost 11 months old and he is the sweetest, easiest baby and I love him to pieces. But I have found motherhood so hard from the start. I have suffered from anxiety for a long time, with periods of low mood, but things have been so so bad probably since I got pregnant.
 

 The early days PP were terrible. Then things got a little easier and I started to feel more like myself again a few months in, but it’s been a constant struggle to stay afloat. Im in a constant state of burnout and overwhelm with all the responsibility and decision making, and have been finding staying at home very isolating. Every now and again I have brief periods of feeling a degree of positivity, but then the persistent low mood sets in again. 
 

 I live in the UK and since autumn has set in seasonal depression has hit on top of PPD, then I lost a pet last week and now I am just at rock bottom. I can’t bear to be in the house alone with my thoughts anymore, but my baby is still non-mobile and has a nap schedule which means I am somewhat limited in what I can do to get out and about. 
 

 I’ve started going back to work 2 days a week and this helped somewhat, but I’m a veterinary nurse and lost the pet I’m currently grieving at my workplace, so even this now feels tainted to me. 
 

 I’ve also started just abandoning morning nap and getting out to baby groups etc or seeing a friend, because I just find mornings at home so hard, but then the naps are off for the rest of the day which comes with other challenges trying to keep a tired baby entertained for hours. 
 

 I do a lot of walking to try and get sunlight (although as I said in the UK it’s so limited right now) and exercise, I’m on medication and see a therapist. But I’m so sick of feeling like this. I want to experience joy again. I look at other people and wish I could be happy like them. I feel like I’m constantly fighting through a fog and it’s so much effort.

66,637,637,637,"There are a lot of threads on Zurzuvae but not a lot with research or updates, so hoping this thread can be more useful. I almost didn’t take the med because of threads I read and I am so glad I did. 
 

 Background: 3 months pp with my second with terrible PPD. Lots of suicidal ideations. Crying constantly. Instant rage. History of depression and have been on Zoloft or Wellbutrin prior. 
 

 TLDR: On day 12, worked at day 4 and has kept working. If you’re experiencing PPD/PPA I promise you aren’t the problem. Your brain is failing you. Reach out for help! 
 

 What I learned before taking Zurzuvae: 
 

 The biggest side effect is somnolence but only 36% of people experienced this (in clinical trial). Other threads make it seem like it knocks everyone out. They did a study and found 9 hours after taking it’s as if your blood alcohol level is 0.05 (legal limit 0.08). It needs to be take with a high fat meal (24-50%) and 400-1000 calories because it is fat soluble. The normal dose is 50 mg, they did have some people drop down to 40 mg with similar affect. It costs about $16,000 without insurance, my insurance denied it at first but approved it after appealing and no cost to me. The original study the moms weren’t breastfeeding. There are a few tiny studies with breast feeding moms and the amount is breast milk is less than 1% weight adjusted, so like taking 0.5 mg dose for us and it doesn’t reach that level until day 5. We tried to learn when the drug peaks in my blood to reduce exposure but they say it’s between 3 and 16 hours so too broad to say. They observed no negative affects with breastfeeding. It is a synthetic 
 

 Side Effects (% of patients in trials): somnolence (36), dizziness (13), diarrhea (6), fatigue (5), UTI (5), memory impairment ( 3), abdominal pain (3), tremor (2), hypoesthesia (2), muscle twitch (2), myalgia/muscle pain (2) 
 

 Side Effects I experienced: dizziness, memory impairment, muscle twitch 
 

 Started Zurzuvae 50mg and here is my day by day breakdown:
 

 Day 1: Took at 7pm (once kids were asleep) with high fat meal. Pretty shortly after felt drunkish or just off. I was worried I may not wake up overnight but did without any issues and was able to take care of the baby. 
 

 Day 2: woke up and felt pretty normal all day. Still depressed. Took second dose at 5:30 pm since it didn’t knock me out like I expected. 
 

 Day 3: Extreme depression (maybe from coming off Wellbutrin) and felt really off. Didn’t feel like I could safely drive all day. Talked to my doctor and discussed dropping to 25 mg but worried it wouldn’t be as effective due to limit data, so tried 50 mg again at 5:30pm. 
 

 Day 4: woke up with energy (despite terrible newborn sleep) and didn’t feel depressed at all. No thoughts of wanting to kill myself. Able to handle unpredictability without crying. 
 

 Day 5: tired but not depressed. I did stay up about 3 hours after taking it and had insomnia which I have seen others report. But Kids having meltdowns and I felt able to handle it. Actually handled the chaos better than my husband for once. All the side effects have gone away despite an occasional headache. 
 

 Day 6-11: no depression or anxiety. I’m the happiest I have been since before my first was born 2 years ago. Have been taking everyday at 5:30 pm. 
 

 Day 12: having moments where I feel like my depression is coming back but not certain. Very dizzy. Difficulties functioning during the day. 
 

 Day 13: depression is back, so sad, and crying a lot. Hoping this is just a temporary swing. Dizziness and weakness again. Very tough day. I didn’t take my last dose bc I couldn’t handle another day of the side effects. 
 

 Day 14: first 24 hours without meds. Feeling much better! Not as good as day 4. It seems like some rebound depression or mood swings are normal while brain rewires. 
 

 Day 14-21: off zurzuvae. Definitely still battling some depression but the intensity is soo much better.

67,646,646,646,"Hi all. 
 

 I did not have a great start to breastfeeding as I didn’t get a session with the lactation consultant before leaving the hospital. We were re-admitted at 48 hours old due to jaundice and baby losing 13% of his body weight. I pumped and fed around the clock (they actually wanted me to try breastfeeding on top of that but it was too much). 
 

 Saw LC multiple times at the hospital and a clinical setting and whenever I tried to feed (with nipple shields can’t BF without them) it would be frustrating because he wouldn’t be getting enough, he was hurting me even with the nipple shields and I still had to bottle feed after.
 

 I think this gave me an aversion to nursing because I no longer feel like I want to or want to be the sole food source for baby and I’m enjoying having others help me when I need a break or nap. 
 

 I’ve been pumping occasionally throughout the day but the milk only amounts to a couple feeds during the day. I hate the feeling of engorgement and I’m not producing that much (probably because I don’t pump that frequently). I totally can’t pump every 3 hours like the recommendation and now I’m up with baby in the morning, feeling engorged and the pain and swelling is really bothering me and making me upset. 
 

 I don’t think this classifies as DMER and while I haven’t gotten a formal diagnosis for any postpartum mental health condition but wondering if anyone else really doesn’t desire to breastfeed like me when I feel like everyone I talk or posts something online talks about how much they want to breastfeed and how hard they’re working to increase supply when I really don’t feel like I want to or have the energy. I also miss my pre-pregnancy/breastfeeding boobs a lot and I think the body image aspect has a big effect on my postpartum experience.

68,647,647,647,"Just a little something I ended up writing at midnight, and I thought this was a place where I could share it without being judged.
 

 

 

 The room was cold, the lights too bright,  
 I had dreamed of calm, of a softer night.  
 I’d planned to breathe, to feel her near,  
 But things unraveled, sharp and clear.
 

 They said it was time, no words to spare,  
 An urgent need, they cut with care.  
 The dream of natural washed away,  
 As I watched my hopes dissolve that day.
 

 No one asked, no one knew,  
 The battle inside that no one could view.  
 I tried to hold on, tried to be strong,  
 But everything felt deeply wrong.
 

 My body failed, or so I thought,  
 A scar remained where I had fought.  
 She’s here, she’s healthy, perfect, and small,  
 Yet I still feel like I lost it all.
 

 The shame seeps in like a quiet storm,  
 How can I feel distant from a life I’ve borne?  
 Her tiny hands, her newborn cries,  
 Yet something inside me silently dies.
 

 I didn’t talk, didn’t share,  
 The guilt inside is too much to bear.  
 Everyone smiles, says she’s a dream,  
 But they don’t see my silent scream.
 

 I love her deeply, more than words can say,  
 But why does my heart still feel this way?

 They tell me I’m lucky, she’s safe, she’s here,  
 But my mind is clouded by fear.  
 Did I fail her? Am I enough?  
 This journey, it’s been far too rough.
 

 Her eyes meet mine, they’re bright and new,  
 And sometimes, I can almost feel it too—  
 That connection I thought would be,  
 But then the guilt washes over me.
 

 I’m scared of this feeling I can’t shake,  
 That I’ve somehow made a mistake.  
 I carried her close, through all the strain,  
 So why does it feel like I’m lost again?
 

 I should feel proud, relieved, at peace,  
 But the fear and guilt, they never cease.  
 She’s here, she’s healthy, my baby girl,  
 Yet my heart is heavy in this broken world.
 

 Maybe, one day, I’ll feel whole inside,  
 The shame and fear will finally subside.

 I was prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro and took my first dose yesterday. I also take Adderall for ADD, but I skipped it yesterday to see how the Lex would affect me. After having breakfast and taking a postnatal vitamin, I took the Lexapro.
 

 Within an hour, I felt somewhat energized. However, after 2-3 hours, I began to feel very strange—dazed, sluggish, with a racing heart and confusion. When my husband came home briefly, he said my pupils were ginormous, which really freaked me out. I told him I felt weird, almost as if I hadn’t slept in days. He thought I was overthinking things and left for work. I was terrified when he left because I didn't want to be home alone with the baby. 
 

 I called my doctor and spoke with a nurse, who suggested my symptoms might be related to the Adderall. I explained that it had been almost 24 hours since my last dose of it (10 mg IR). She then suggested I might be experiencing anxiety and advised me to take it easy but to continue taking the Lexapro. She also told me to call or go to the ER if my symptoms worsened.
 

 I know how drugs feel. I was high, and not in a fun way. It felt similar to a comedown from Molly (MDMA) or a speed bender with no sleep. This unsettling feeling lasted about 4 to 5 hours before improving, but I felt on edge and strung out for the rest of the day. I realize this isn’t typical for SSRIs, but I can’t dismiss what I experienced. It didn’t feel like an anxiety attack; my body was reacting poorly to the medication.

 Some information: 
 I’m a stay at home mom, my husband works.
 

 On his night shifts, I stay at my parents because I’m too afraid to stay home alone. 
 

 He recently took some time off, which meant I had him home for a while. He just went back to work and I’ve been having such a difficult time staying home - and the “root” of the problem is being afraid to spend wake windows with my baby. 
 

 We have a routine and when I’m busy with the essentials (feeding, pumping, diaper changes, etc) I’m fine. But when everything slightly settles down and my baby is playing and I get a glimpse of the clock and realize I have 1-2 hours of wake time with them still I begin to panic, I cry nonstop.  
 

 I’ve felt like this before with night shifts, but all other shifts I was completely fine. And out of nowhere, after his time off I can’t function on any kind of shift. 
 

 I’m just looking for some answers/ words of advice. Idk. I’m just so lost..

 He sent me a reel last night about a lady who said she was trying to do everything ie feminism and live up to the hype of social media. She said she “thinks” men want a nurturing partner to produce offspring and create a peaceful home.  
 So I asked him why he married me and he can’t give me an answer that isn’t tied to me being a mother. I kept asking and he said it was because I was kind and loving and wanted to improve myself as a person. He also commented on my looks quoting the Song of Solomon.  
 So I told him that I guess I am looking for a specific answer that he can’t give me. Other than I’m “nice and kind”. That just affirmations to me that I am not “special” or “unique” in any way. He could meet up with any number of women and determine they are nice and kind and want to improve themselves. His answer just affirms to me that I am replaceable and he can find happiness with someone else who is not me. Someone who is smarter, prettier, funny, and better at everything else. 
 

 Tell me I am not wrong for wanting a better answer than just he likes me for “being giving and helping other people”. 
 What kind of an answer is that? I know I’m not the prettiest and my body isn’t what it used to be. I have lots of grey hair that has appeared within the last year. My face is tired and saggy. I’m not educated and don’t have any marketable skills. I’m just a SAHM and I don’t even do a good job at that. I don’t know what he wants from me but what he is saying is not helping.",,"last week tough switch med serious side effect suicide ideation make list belonging do upon passing not tell husband talk go emergency room feel need kid would ok house would sort thing

I feel like a horrible mom because I get so frustrated and I end up yelling or crying or just throwing something when I separate myself. Have any mamas dealt with this? I want help. I want to be a better mom for my baby girl and not wanting to be like this anymore. I never wanted to be a single mom, but this is the card I’ve been dealt. When I ask the women in my family for help, they just tell me to suck it up and deal with it cuz “nobody told me to have a kid” and to figure it out. I love my baby girl so much. She is my entire world. But I feel like I should already have a handle on how to deal with her by now since we’re a year in.

 Hi everyone, I’m a mom in my 20s with a 5-month-old baby. I’m currently a stay-at-home mom (SAHM), and while I absolutely love my baby and would never do anything to hurt them, I’m feeling overwhelmed, lost, and constantly crying myself to sleep. Lately, I’ve been battling suicidal thoughts, but I need to clarify: I would never harm my baby—it’s just that this new life is starting to crush me emotionally.
 

 Financially, I feel like I’m drowning. We’ve always been careful with our money, but now my husband checks our budget every week. It used to be once a month, but lately, it’s gotten so much more frequent, and I feel like I’m being micromanaged. I know saving is important, but it’s getting harder to breathe under the constant pressure. I miss having financial freedom, and I’m beginning to resent being a SAHM. I want to work, to feel like I can make my own money and decisions again but I guess this comes down to getting married where it’s no longer “ My” but “ Our money”.
 

 One of the reasons we haven’t opted for child care is that it doesn’t sit well with us. There have been constant news/stories about daycare centers overdosing kids with patches or drugs to calm them down, and we’re not keen on the idea of someone else teaching or influencing our child about things we don’t want them to be part off . It’s just unsettling.
 

 I probably know why I’m feeling this way but this is a background story. Growing up, I had a very different lifestyle. My mom was a widow and worked hard to provide for us to the point her business boomed, she also hired help—nannies,stay at home helpers —to manage things. I never had to do much in terms of chores, and I always had people taking care of me when I was young . I know that sounds privileged, and it is, but that’s the life I grew up with( my grandparents are against the idea of having people around to do houseworks and stuff coz they think it’s gonna make us lazy.
 ). 
 When I finished my degree in pharmacy (which was more of my mom’s dream than mine), I decided I wanted to live my own life and I was encouraged by my uncle (It’s probably a way for him to make me independent). I told my mom I was moving to a different country, and I asked for her help with just the processing part like plane ticket and atleast $2k pocket money and that’s it—I wanted to do the rest on my own. It worked. I didn’t want to rely on her money, and I managed to build my life from there.I’m a nurse now and manage to pay all my bills by working 2 or 3 jobs while I was studying.
 

 Fast forward to now, and it feels like I’ve gone from being independent to completely dependent again. My husband sometimes jokes that I should manage to take care of our baby because my mom raised four kids, but I have to remind him that my mom had help. And now I’m pressured that he’s talking about a second child,him and almost all the people around me.
 He does his share of housework because I told him from the beginning that I wouldn’t be doing it all alone unless we were rich enough to hire help. But lately, I’m feeling resentful. He listens to podcasts and videos about parenting, but I wish he would focus more on searching how to physically help with the baby. He works from home three days a week, I just want him to step up and I don’t want to be a nag or doesn’t want him to feel that I’m ordering him around . He doesn’t have initiatives. Instead, I have to ask him to do it, or remind him when it’s time for a bath.He constantly forgets about it and I feel like he doesn’t even know his own child’s routine. We talked about it and he started taking our baby out of our room with him every morning coz our baby wakes up early so he got time to play with her while I continue to sleep. 
 

 I get that he might be under pressure, too, but if he expects me to stay at home for the next five years or more( which he expects me to be and do home schooling), he needs to level up financially. I’m not willing to live a life where we constantly struggle. His mom can’t help on weekdays, and my family isn’t in the country, so I’m feeling even more isolated.
 

 I never thought being a SAHM would feel this suffocating or financially restricting. I love my baby, but I’m not loving this life, and I feel guilty about that. Has anyone else been through this? How did you cope with these feelings or find a way to gain more control over your life? Any advice would mean the world to me.
 

 Thanks for reading.

 Lately, I find myself repeating in my head, “This is my son; I am his mom,” but sometimes it feels like I’m taking care of someone else’s baby. That thought breaks my heart. I go through phases where I either feel overwhelmed, constantly researching and trying to perfect my parenting, or I feel completely numb. When I feel nothing, it’s like I’m living in a dull haze, and I worry that I’m cheating my son out of a joyful experience.
 

 

 He’s almost 6 months old, and I’m just out of energy. I thought I was just tired, which I am, but it feels like it’s deeper than that. I try to engage with him and support his development, but I find myself becoming apathetic. Some days, I’d rather just put him in front of the TV and stare at the wall.
 

 

 I’m embarrassed to admit that I’ve lied on the pediatrician’s questionnaires about PPD. I always rushed through them to avoid raising any flags, but now I don’t know how to approach my doctor. All I want is to be a better mom for my baby.
 

 

 If anyone has been through something similar, I would appreciate any advice or guidance on how to navigate these feelings. How do I know if I need medication or additional support? Thank you for reading.",,"ftm think might struggle ppd ppa sure feel part new mom something serious

93,778,778,778,"My wife had our baby 8 days ago. She came home on day 5. 
 

 She forbade me to be in the birthing room because I don't speak the local language well enough to communicate with the doctors or be a medical proxy. I reluctantly agreed. Her mom went instead. After she came home, she accused me of abandoning her at the hospital. I asked her if she heard herself or remembered the long arguments where I said I wanted to be there and I was scared to leave her alone. She said even if I spoke the local language, I would have abandoned her because that's the kind of person I am. 
 

 Now, she is chasing me for every little error I make. Microwave door open? She points at it and asks me if I'm 5 and why she has to remind me. 
 

 We both get up at night to feed/burp the baby, but I am so anxious about our marriage that I can't fall back to sleep afterward. So I get about 1-2 hours of sleep a night while she gets 3-4. I do all the house chores when i get home and cook breakfast and dinner, but if I do them not exactly how she would, she reminds me and chastised me for being lazy. 
 

 MIL comes in the day time to help with baby. Recently MIL is doing the same thing wife is. Chastising me for this and thay, getting involved in disagreements my wife and I have had in the past. When I stand up to MIL and gently but sarcastically tell her off (b/c I'm not married to her and don't have to take anything from her) wife blames me for being rude. 
 

 I'm literally assaulted from all sides and my wife refuses to see any wrong in her mother and all the wrong in me. She gaslights me and demands that I apologize. Blames me that she doesn't have enough milk for the baby. 
 

 In a rare lucid moment, she admitted that she would be offended if my mother did to her what her mother does to me. My parents are far away though and can't help. But she still says I should apologize and accept her mother's rudeness.
 

 I cannot sustain this. I might be able to if I could sleep. But I can't. I gently suggested investigating PPA/PPD to my wife earlier and she says I'm gaslighted her. Don't tell me it will be over in 6 months to a year. I will either have suffered a psychotic break or have left by that time. Help. 
 

 Edit to say that I have already bared my heart to her, ugly cried and pleaded with her just to try to be nice.

I had to get a c-section very last minute at my 38 week appointment because my blood pressure was not coming down and my baby was still breech. I barely had anything ready and set up at home too. After I had my baby things still continued to feel chaotic. I had what I was told was acid reflux throughout my pregnancy but it turned out to be gallbladder attacks. I went to the ER for one after my birth and was told it was actually my gallbladder. I had to stay at a hospital out of town for 4 days. I only stayed for so long because the gastroenterologist I was given drug everything out.. I didn’t even have the problem solved while there and he made me make an outpatient appointment after my stay to get things done.. Then a hurricane came through my area and thankfully we weren’t affected but my city was pretty shut down and it slowed down my progress on getting things done. Then I had to go back to the ER because my c-section incision had a small opening on one end (thankfully it’s healed now). That same night I had the worst gallbladder attack that also gave me a horrible panic attack. The pain lasted for 3 days and I went back to the ER on the third day. My levels elevated due to my gastroenterologist procrastinating my procedure. I got sent back to the hospital out of town to stay the night and then have my procedure. For 3-4 days after my procedure I was in a lot of pain and had so much soreness. They also didn’t take out my gallbladder and only put a stent in the duct so I’ve been paranoid that the pain will eventually come back.

100,827,827,827,"I’m seeking advice on ways to prevent postpartum depression. I have three sons. My first, who is now 7, was very calm as a baby. He would eat, sleep, and cry very little. I could go anywhere with him without worrying about crying in public or feeling overwhelmed. 
 

 However, my second child was the opposite—he cried almost 24/7, and it was exhausting both mentally and physically. My mom helped for a while, but after she left, I felt stuck at home. I couldn’t go anywhere because his crying was relentless, even in the car. My personality is quite introverted, so I avoided going out. I fell into a cycle of depression that lasted four years. It was such a difficult time, and I felt like I was losing control. I became paranoid about my health, convinced I had every disease, and went through multiple tests, including CT scans, MRIs, and colonoscopies. I knew I wasn’t well, but I felt powerless to stop it. Thankfully, as my son grew, he became a sociable, smart, and funny kid, and my mental health improved.
 

 Recently, I had my third son about a month ago, hoping he would be more like my first. However, he cries a lot, and I’m experiencing the same challenges as before. I can’t take a shower, cook, or do anything for myself. He doesn’t sleep at night, and during the day, he only naps for 10 minutes before crying again. I’m terrified of slipping into depression once more, especially now that I have responsibilities towards my other children and need to complete my thesis by December.

 I'm writing this after finally breaking down and crying at work.

But, I'm not fine, I've never been more overwhelmed, I cannot mentally handle the work I was doing before, and I need help.

I can’t be present for my daughter or husband because I am living in the worst anxiety over it all. And my therapist has tried to logic me into thinking more positive but I can’t be. I have this thought too that because I have never heard of anyone personally dying of child birth it’s gonna be me. I’m not even pregnant or looking to get pregnant again anytime soon. Anyone else?

105,874,874,874,"Forgive my rambling, I think I just need to vent. 
 

 I can count on one hand the times my daughter cried. Three times at the hospital before we realized she was having latching issues, once during her first diaper rash, and once when we accidentally kept her up past her wake window.
 

 She’s truly a dream baby. When she’s hungry, she’ll whine a bit— then immediately beam the brightest smile when she sees her father or I come to pick her up. 4 month old and I’ve woken up every morning terrified it’ll end, but no. She’ll keep me up until 2 am, sure; but with giggles and joy that I’d be happy to lose sleep to behold. I love her with every fiber of my being.
 

 All this, all this joy, all her love, all my boyfriend’s love, the gift of motherhood I was never supposed to experience— and I’m a shell.
 

 Empty and somehow simultaneously in absolute agony.
 

 I broke down in front of her for the first time tonight. Through all my pain, I always smile when she looks at me. It didn’t matter if I had to choke back tears with suicidal thoughts in my brain, she never ever saw me cry. I broke down and would you believe it— my saving grace smiled at me. I saw the big, goofy, gummy smile and I broke. I laid her down, fell to the ground and wailed.
 

 My boyfriend deserves better than the mess I am, my parents deserve better, and at the tippy too of it all— my daughter deserves better.
 

 I haven’t showered in weeks, I never leave the house, I barely eat and live on cold water and nicotine (no, I’m not breastfeeding). I want to say I don’t recognize myself, but I’ve lived a life plagued with mental illness— honestly, I feel like I recognize myself now more than ever. I’m back in that dark place I found comfort in before I met my daughter’s father. I feel like I tricked myself into false happiness with the love of my life and our child. I love them, I am happy, I should be fucking happy. I’m so blessed, but why? My daughter is perfect, healthy. I am loved, I’m cared for and I am important, why can’t I let myself feel it?
 

 I think about death way too often nowadays, but I could never do that to my family. My boyfriend is planning to propose soon, I’m an only child and my dad just recovered from cancer. My dogs starve themselves when I’m not around. I need to be here, I want to be here, but god why can’t I get the thoughts out of my brain?
 

 Therapy, medication, I don’t have insurance and I’m on a fucking waiting list for therapy? I want to kill myself and I’m on a waitlist. I’m so emotional and cold and distant, I know it hurts my boyfriend because he doesn’t know how to handle it. What can I say? What do I tell him when he asks how he can help? There’s nothing, I don’t even know how to help myself. How do you say “dig me out” when there’s quicksand in your throat?
 

 What do I do when there’s nothing to do? I literally can’t bring myself to leave the house, I can’t bring myself to do anything. I’m broken.
 

 My partner needs me, my family loves me— but I’m too deep in the quicksand to hear their muffled cries. The only thing I hear through the fog is my daughter needing me. Her tiny little noises when she needs a change or wants a cuddle.
 

 I thought I knew darkness before, but fuck— at least I could kill myself before. I don’t have that luxury now. I grew up without a mother, how could I let my baby go through that?
 

 My boyfriend is struggling in his own way too, I know the change took a toll on his mental health— he works a strenuous job full time so I can stay home with our daughter. He works hard, he makes me breakfast, he helps with chores. What do I give him in return? Mood swings that hit like wrecking balls and an unclean home, a mess of a woman.
 

 God, fuck. What is happening to me? I just want to feel the joy I know is surrounding me. My hair is falling out in literal clumps and I have a stress rash that I can’t seem to get rid of. I’m a fucking disaster.",,"forgive rambling think need vent

110,918,918,918,"Hi all, 
 

 I started feeling not myself when my LO was about 5 months (I think, memory is a bit hazy)... 
 Took me a month or 2 to look for help. Then another 3 or 4 to get off waiting lists and get help. 
 My symptoms got worse as I waited. I didn't think it was PPD as I wasn't sad or experiencing psychosis. 
 I was having some out of body experiences, I could sleep 16 hours a day easily and still be tired, incredible brain fog and short term/long term memory issues and a general apathy for all things in relationship, life, my child or even my own parents. 
 

 Started SSRIs, was given a diagnosis and the apathy started to lessen and I had validation and hope which felt great. 
 Started feeling a little better... bit by bit... a couple of set backs and my dose increased bit by bit. 
 

 I got pregnant again which I was delighted about. Dose increased again a little while later. Now to 175mg... max dose 200mg. 
 

 My biggest issue now is dissociation. I find it so hard to feel anything. My therapist reckons it's a life long struggle of growing up learning to supress. I want to be excited about my new LO. I want to experience the joy I know I can with my nearly 2 year old. I want to feel fear and love. 
 

 I suppose I'm wondering if anyone else ever went through something similar? Is it the meds? I am making intellectual brakethroughs by the dozen in therapy- linking my fear of loss ans abandonment ans exclusion, a love so great as having a baby my body shut down all emotions so that I couldn't fear losing it if anything happened. 
 If my dose lowers will I be able to feel more? Am I stuck like this forever? Did I ever have feelings?

 My son was born by emergency c section which I feel traumatized me a lot, I did very much want him but was not prepared for this at all. I had my older son about 5 years ago and also dealt with PPD/A but I feel like this is so much worse. 
 

 He is inconsolable 90% of the time unless he’s being held and then when you do hold him, you pay for it after because he screams being put down. I don’t want to wear baby-wear because I get overstimulated by having to be “attached” to him and I’ve tried swings/bouncy balls but he solely just wants to be in someone’s fucking arms 24/7 and screams for at least 20-30mins and sometimes hours. 
 

 We’ve brought him to the paediatrician who ruled out gas/formula issues and claims he’s just a “Velcro baby” and I need to just “remain calm”. I also have the issue of family telling me I need to just give in and hold him, which makes my life harder because of the aftermath. Certain family continue to overhold him against my wishes, also making my life miserable after which is extremely frustrating. 
 

 I feel like this stage is hell everyday and is going by so slowly. I want my life back and feel like I’ve been robbed of my own mental peace and most times feel like I don’t like my baby at all. 
 

 I also lost my father about a month ago and can barely mourn in fucking peace because apparently my baby’s having a harder life than I am and needs to cry consistently. 
 

 My partner is extremely helpful but also works so I try not to ask him to leave too often but, he will whenever I ask. My other son is on the ASD spectrum and is not as difficult to deal with but in finding I’m having less patience with him due to dealing with the other child. 
 

 I just really feel as if this baby has ruined my life and I just don’t see a light at the end because this seems to just be his personality and I’m in fear for what’s to come next. Especially with overbearing and spoiling family members that will probably make the situation worse when he’s older. 
 

 I guess I’m looking for some encouragement, it does feel good to vent but I’m just tired of feeling like this everyday because I know it’s not my true self and a lot of the circumstances are not my fault.

113,932,932,932,"Sharing for the mama who feels like she is suffocating under her PPD and PPA. 
 

 I took my first Zoloft yesterday. 
 

 It took me 4.5 years to get here. Here as in, a place where I’ve realized I cannot holistically heal myself from my PPD any longer. 
 

 In 2020 (S/O to the Covid mamas…), I welcomed my first child. An answered prayer. The joy of my life. Everything I ever wanted. 
 

 I almost immediately began to spiral into what I now know was PPD and PPA. 
 Every symptom you can imagine, I had/have it. Rage towards my husband, inability to make simple decisions, overwhelming anxiety, sleep deprivation, no joy, panic attacks… the whole enchilada. 
 

 I pushed through. Despite it almost crippling my marriage entirely. 
 

 It is by God’s providential grace my marriage is still in tact, as I almost single handily destroyed it from a place of PPD and PPA. 
 

 I was 9 months PP with my first child when I started to take proactive steps to heal. 
 Christian counseling.
 Prayer. 
 Bible studies.
 Daily exercise. 
 Adequate sleep. 
 Letting my husband and parents help me with childcare so I could go out for a solo errand. 
 High quality supplementation. 
 Whole food diet. 
 

 I slowly started to heal. Time helped, too. 
 I healed, but I was never fully back to normal again. I just lessened the load and learned to live with it. PPD and PPA was my new baseline. 
 

 I now have 3 beautiful children and one angel baby (miscarriage). 
 

 4 pregnancies. 4.5 years. 
 

 I never healed. I just carried PPD and PPA with me this entire time. I silently suffered. Although I never felt feelings of rage or disconnect towards my children, my internal dialogue was like a scene from 300 at all times. I lived in fight or flight. I hated my husband and parents for NO reason. I was not rational. 
 

 I was a/am a high functioning depressed, anxious woman. 
 

 Well, this week I decided I didn’t want to live like this anymore. 
 “A wise woman builds her home, but a foolish woman tears it down with her own hands.” - yep, that’s me. 
 

 Paul in Romans 7 when he says his heart and mind want to do what’s right but the flesh can’t listen? Yep, me. 
 

 For the sake of my marriage, my household environment, family culture, and my OWN JOY…. I talked to a professional this week. 
 

 And guess what? From carrying this for so long, I’m on the verge of entering major depression. I also have premenstrual dysphoric disorder and probably have had general anxiety disorder my whole life. 
 

 There is no amount of kale I can eat, supplements I can take, weights I can lift, sleep I can sleep, and sunshine I can bask in that will change my messed up serotonin. 
 

 So, yesterday, I took my first Zoloft. This is not my end. This is my beginning. This is not failure. This is actually bravery, admitting I can’t do it alone. It took me almost five years and it almost cost me everything. I’m not less of a Christian or less of a woman because I’m now prescribed an SSRI. 
 

 I can’t heal when I’m trying to survive. I pray Zoloft will help me learn to thrive again so I can work on me more intentionally and in a less frantic way. Zoloft helps my brain so I can help my heart. That’s what I’m hoping. 
 

 SO - if you’re reading this and you’re afraid to be honest with your doctor because you don’t want to be labeled something or you are fighting help… Pray about it. Be strong. Be courageous. And know you don’t have to hold this all together on your own.

I don’t want to be here ( not in suicidal way) it’s just too much and I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I feel like the only time I’m happy is when I’m playing with my sons. I’m scared that my partner will get fed up and leave because I can’t get him to understand how I feel. How do I get him to understand he’s not doing anything and to stop thinking I’m attacking him all the time when in reality I am doing everything in my power to not go off the deep end?

 After the birth of my second son 8 weeks ago, I was fine for 2 weeks, experienced mild anxiety but I loved my baby more than anything.  Then the ppd set in and I want nothing to do with my baby, don’t feel like I love him, annoyed that I have to take care of him (he is very well taken care of I just have no desire to care for him).  
 

 I can’t stop ruminating over the fact I have lost all my love for my kids and joy of life. I don’t feel connected, but I WANT to feel connected SO BAD! This in turn ramps up my anxiety.  I have to take Ativan most days to get thru the day. I started zoloft 25mg 4 weeks ago and just upped it to 50mg yesterday with the help of a psychiatrist.

116,936,936,936,"This is something that has bugged me for ALONG time and I am wondering if anyone else has these thoughts of if I just have some weird attachment issues. It is causing a lot of my PPD issues because I am blaming the girls for ""ruining my life"".
 

 Backstory: I met my fiancé when I was 26 and he was 27. Before I met him I was in a relationship with a man twice my age, who was very boring so I did not do typical ""20 year old things"". I worked 2 jobs and then sat around the house when I wasn't working. My now husband on the other hand was very adventurous during that time, had/has a huge friend group who was always together, partied, took trips and just had a lot of fun.
 

 I met my husband and finally had SO much fun. I fit right into the friend group and we were always together and having the best times. I was so happy I finally had found my best friend who I loved doing life with. The man of my dreams. Our relationship moved fast and we got engaged 10 months into our relationship and started wedding planning. We were supposed to be married this past June, however we unexpectedly ended up getting pregnant and had to push the wedding back (was due a week after our set date). We ended up going to the courthouse for insurance reasons and got married and just had our twin girls 2 months ago. He is an amazing father and even better husband, all 3 of us girls are truly blessed. It is a love I have never known and feel so lucky to have him.
 

 That being said...even before our girls were born I really struggled with the fact that I wish I had met him sooner. I feel myself almost get angry and resentful that I did not get that pre-kid, teen, 20's time with him. I got a taste of it for 2 years and it was the best 2 years of my life. I know how much fun life could have been during that younger time with him. Him and his friend group talk about all the ""wild"" times they had together and I just wish I could have been there with him. Then we had the girls and it really felt like the nail in the coffin. Like that I am officially ""old and boring"" and even further proves that I will never have that stage of life with him. Which is silly because we still do SO much (we are blessed with a lot of support for our girls from friends and family) and I have the rest of my life with him. Like we just sat at our friends house last night for a bonfire and drinks with the girls with us and had a fun night. I just for some reason cannot shake the anger, sadness and longing for more of those younger years with him. I find myself crying on almost a daily basis because I just long for something I will never have and don't know how to accept that. It makes me have awful thoughts about my girls, like this is somehow their fault and makes me not want them. Like stuck in the ""what if""...what would life look like if we didn't have them. Would I be happier? I tourture myself with these thoughts. Maybe this is a co-dependency/attachment issue? Has anyone else felt like this?",,"something bug along time wonder anyone else thought weird attachment issue cause lot ppd issue blame girl ruin life

117,944,944,944,"I am 12 months postpartum now and still struggling with PPD symptoms which started 2.5 weeks after I delivered. This has been the worst and darkest year of my life. I don’t wish PPD on anyone! 
 

 I’ve tried therapy and Zoloft which slightly improved my symptoms but never truly healed or cured it or made it better. Got off the Zoloft about two months ago and have since been feeling really bad again. 
 

 How do I get my doctor to prescribe zurzuvae? I brought it up once but they dismissed it saying it was very costly and unless I was willing to pay out of pocket, it would be hard to get. I have great insurance though and would like to try. 
 

 Also, would they prescribe it even though I’m 12 months postpartum? Are my symptoms now considered just depression?

118,946,946,946,"To preface, I never intended to be a parent, I have struggled with mental health my entire life constantly in flight or flight. My husband and I have grown apart in vast measures that I didn't even realize until my one year postpartum mark. I do love my daughter deeply, I believe I can be there for her in ways I didn't know I was capable of because of my love for her. And I surprise myself daily with how well I do and how well she's growing. 
 

 However, I'm struggling immensely with my mental health and the state of my marriage is obviously not helping at all. I feel like I'm pulling the weight of everything and my husband constantly forgets how fragile I am with my mental health. I won't go in to detail but I am constantly advocating for myself and the space for my feelings, I am always making the sacrifices and putting literally everyones well being before my own and always getting the shit end of the stick in every conversation I initiate to find solutions. It honestly feels like my husband is offended and resentful to me that I am not in love with motherhood and not making sacrifices with a big smile on my face (even though I told him before we got married I didn't want to be a parent- our pregnancy was not planned). I desperately wish for the day I can wake up and feel happiness and peace and feel rested enough without riddling myself with guilt to enjoy my daughter. 
 

 I know I am in a bad spiral, I know that this is a rut, but I don't know how to keep myself in a neutral headspace to prevent these horrific spirals where I feel so utterly numb I don't have the energy to feel hopeful. I feel like I'm running frantically, only to be stuck in the same place. I want to enjoy life, I want to rediscover myself, fall in love with this new identity of mine and happily be present watching my daughter grow. But I am pulling and giving from an empty cup, I literally don't remember the last time I felt any sort of relief. I feel like something is wrong with me because I still feel this way despite being one year postpartum. 
 

 My husband and I agreed to have our daughter start daycare so that we could have more time to work on our relationship and ourselves individually to be at a healthy place with ourselves and in turn be better to each other and our family. But I feel immensely guilty about it, it feels like I am placing her care with other people so that I can have some alone time.... I feel like she'll hate me if I don't spend every second with her and I already feel like a failure of a mother because I am not enjoying motherhood as society perpetuates I should be at this point. 
 

 This is the most honest I have been in a long time. Please leave any suggestions or comments that it does get better (or worse) from your experience and anything that I should try to implement to make my life feel less like I am auto piloting everything. Also, I apologize if this didn't make sense, I am all over the place with how overwhelmed I am feeling.",,"preface never intend parent struggle mental health entire life constantly flight flight husband grow apart vast measure not even realize one year postpartum mark love daughter deeply believe way not know capable love surprise daily well well grow

She stopped crying while I was crying and I know she likely felt so neglected. I haven’t been sleeping because my anxiety has been so intense. She’s a great sleeper although not at the same times everyday but when she’s asleep I can’t sleep. I just worry and worry. I feel like I have to get chores around the house done and then the day rolls around and I can’t be there for her because I haven’t slept at all. My anxiety is just so bad right now. I’m on medication and I’m going to therapy. It’s just not helping. I can’t eat or sleep. I have no appetite. I could go all day without eating and not notice. My husband luckily took her before I had been crying for too long. But he got mad at me and kept saying “she’s just a baby” and “you’re not enough”. I handle all of the night feedings and diaper changes because I feel like he won’t wake up. And when I try to sleep, he bothers me almost constantly. I know he’s not trying to be unhelpful, but I am so sleep deprived. I only get maybe three hours a day. That sleep is over multiple sessions. I don’t ever get uninterrupted sleep for more than an hour. I must mention that my anxiety is super high because I have PTSD from childhood abuse. I’m terrified of not hearing her when she cries and neglecting her. I don’t ever want to subject her to what I was subjected to. I feel like me sleeping consistently will subject her to potential neglect. I just can’t take care of myself for fear of not being there for her. I’m positively exhausted.
