1,176,176,176,"Hey all! A few months ago I had posted here asking if anyone had any experiences with Zurzuvae. I had previously had PPD with my first baby and just had my second baby 3 weeks ago with an 18 month age gap. I also had no prior history of depression before getting PPD. I wanted to share my experience since it’s a fairly new drug and there wasn’t a whole lot of info out there when I started looking into it.
 

 I was able to get a prior authorization from my insurance to cover the Zurzuvae so I did have the actual prescription filled before I gave birth and only paid a $5 copay. If I didn’t have insurance it would’ve been upwards of $20,000. I started taking it the day I came home from the hospital (less than 48 hours after giving birth).
 

 Overall I immediately felt better after giving birth the second time than the first time around. Deliveries were both vaginal and generally pretty easy (including postpartum recovery). With my first the hormone drop was IMMEDIATE and I remember feeling weepy/sad literally the second she came out. This time around, even without taking the Zurzuvae yet, I felt way better and really experienced that “newborn bliss” everyone talks about. I’m 3 weeks pp and still feeling completely normal aside from a couple of random crying episodes (but honestly I attribute it to normal postpartum hormonal changes because they were so minor).
 

 While taking the Zurzuvae I didn’t experience any of the side effects people talked about on this sub- especially the tiredness. The only tiredness I really felt was normal newborn tired. I never really worried about the “eat something really fatty before taking” and aside from a little dizziness here and there had no side effects whatsoever.
 

 It’s hard to know for sure if the Zurzuvae kept the PPD away or if I just got lucky with the hormonal balance this time around, but either way if you can take it I’d recommend it- my personal opinion is that it won’t hurt to try!
 

 Also last thing to note- throughout my pregnancy and even now through postpartum I took/am taking a few vitamin supplements on top of my prenatals— iron, B6, D3. I started taking the B6 and D3 around 24 weeks pregnant and the iron around 32ish weeks pregnant. I’ve continued to take these postpartum and will continue to do so for 6 months (it took around 6 months for me to battle through the PPD last time). Obviously talk to your medical professional but I have a sneaking suspicion these supplements actually helped me keep the PPD at bay this time around. I’m not a doctor, this is purely an uneducated gut feeling �
 

 tldr Took Zurzuvae immediately after birth of my 2nd; no side effects and no PPD 3wks pp. Unsure if it was the Zurzuvae that helped or I just got lucky this time around.",,"hey month ago post ask anyone experience zurzuvae previously ppd first baby second baby  week ago  month age gap also prior history depression get ppd want share experience since fairly new drug not whole lot info start look

After going through my history- trying it about 6 years ago and it having negative effects, she suggested lexapro instead. For background I am 4 months PP dealing with depression and rage. I am breastfeeding and we want to try for another baby this year so a medicine safe for both of these situations is important. 
 

 I am on day 3. I have not slept in 3 days. Maybe combined 6 hours. When I do get some sleep it is restless and horrible. I’m not one to overreact but this is actually worse than having a fresh newborn- sleep wise. Next I’m clenching my jaw without noticing, and it’s painful. I’m not sure if it’s because I get frustrated sleeping or what. Last, I’m late on my period, not pregnant. I saw online this could be because of lexapro. I really do not want it to hinder my fertility at all. 
 

 I know everyone’s initial reaction is probably to change medications but I don’t want to give up. Only a few are really “safe” for pregnancy and breastfeeding. Has anyone else had these symptoms?

 My brother and his gf had their first baby in the fall. She has always been a bit crazy even before she got pregnant (example: made a scene at the grocery store and squared up to an older lady because she told my brother he had unique eyes - which he does, he’s received that compliment his whole life) but since having the baby, her emotions have been at an all time high on both ends. I feel terrible for her because there is no neutral ground for her anymore.
 

 I believe she knows she is having signs of PPD as she’ll post on social media crying about the baby and how she’s struggling but when my brother tries to help with anything or simply talk to her, she rages and tells him how stupid he is or that he’s a POS. One time I was on the phone with him when he asked if he could feed the baby for her because she was tired and she started screaming and said she would c*t her head off and c*t her wrist if that would make him leave her alone. About twice a week she packs her car up with the baby’s things and tries to take her daughter to her grandmas to live there while my brother is at work. Yesterday when she tried that it was because my brother was active on Snapchat while he was at work (it was something I sent him) and she thought he was cheating (he’s never cheated a day in his life). 
 

 He’s tried to bring up the ppd with her and talked about her speaking with the doctor and she just wants no part of it and gets mad again. At this point, I’m worried about her, my brother, AND the baby all being in an environment that can get that extreme. He’s at a loss for what to do and how to help, she’s living like she doesn’t want to acknowledge it, and unfortunately she doesn’t really have any friends or family she can confide in. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!!
 

 (Side note - I’m sorry if I come off insensitive or not understanding in any way. I’ve got no kids but I do understand how much your body goes through and how easy it is to be all over the place while you try to heal. Again, I’m just looking for help for them)",,"hello

7,282,282,282,"I am freshly postpartum and my world is reeling from how quick transition from pregnancy, through birth, then now has been. My husband has been absolutely wonderful support and so in love with our baby - physical recovery so far has been uncomfortable but I’ve been able to just heal in bed while easing into breastfeeding, motherhood, etc. But, I am an emotional wreck. I have a history of mental health challenges, which I’ve been able to manage with my husband and healthcare providers in my corner, and pregnancy was wonderful. 
 

 I was prepared to feel a lot of heightened emotion but am surprised at how it’s manifesting. I feel this overwhelming, suffocating grief and sadness now that pregnancy is over. I’m grateful my baby is here and that we get to spend our lives together, but I’m devastated. It’s the most confusing feeling - so happy yet so sorrowful. I wasn’t ready to no longer feel kicks or rolls, to not have my giant belly, to not listen to his heartbeat at appointments… I can’t even look at ultrasounds or photos of me while pregnant without sobbing. 
 

 And when I say sobbing, I mean sometimes to the point of just escalating into pure panic. Then the anxious thoughts starts because now that I’m not pregnant, I can’t protect my baby like I could before and something could happen. I can’t wait to watch baby grow but at the same time I want time to freeze so I can just stay in this newborn phase with my family forever. My heart can’t handle the thought of change. I just stare at the little hands and toes and cry. I’m not sure if that even makes sense. 
 

 I’m not overwhelmed by anything except how I feel. The hormone crash is intense. I’ve talked to my husband about how I’ve been feeling and it’s a struggle to form sentences through the tears. My Dr. was able to see me today and gave me referrals to great resources. So, I’m not alone. I also am aware that emotional upheaval is normal and will most likely pass as my body adjusts but… I just needed one more second with my beautiful baby while pregnant. To feel that connection again.

I had pretty terrible PPD with a NICU baby, emergency c-section, and near-death experience during childbirth - it was one of the most challenging periods of my life. Not to mention hating breastfeeding and wanting to throw my husband off a cliff. 
 

 I did a ton of therapy, and after a while, my therapist suggested that I try psilocybin. I tried it, and it truly changed my life. It was like 50 therapy sessions in 5 hours. I don't know where I would be without today. I share this because I learned that there is a stage 2 clinical trial where moms with PPD can get access to a psilocybin experience. If anyone is really struggling - it might be worth looking into - it's incredible to be on the other side of crippling depression.

 I just feel empty every time I look at myself. I love my son so much but I feel like I have died. We have an 18 month old golden doodle, who acts great when my husband is home but when I’m alone with her, she grabs burb cloths, pacifiers, our laundry, and some other things. I think it’s because she likes me chasing her and thinks it’s play, but I can’t chase her as well with my leg so I’ve had to lure her with treats and grab whatever when she’s been eating the treat. Lately I feel like if it’s not my son crying, my dog is whining, and I’m trying to keep the house in relative order. My leg hurts so much from all the walking around the house I’m doing it’s extremely painful for me to do the night feeds, so my husband is doing it, which is making me feel guilty as well.
 

 I was pretty good at showering when my son naps but lately I’m too scared to so I’ve waited until my husband gets home, usually I’m begging him to walk the dog (she’s usually whining to go out, but he’s does the ‘she’s fine give me a few minutes’) so I can shower with peace of mind that someone is around if he needs anything. 
 

 I get really mad now about everything. All the visitors we’ve been having I’m annoyed, when I don’t have visitors I’m anxious about being alone all day.

 I’ve seen a lot of people in this sub say they have a hard time bonding with their baby or they just don’t love them. I love my baby more than life itself. The further I get into postpartum though, the more I hate myself. 
 

 My birth didn’t go as expected at all. I was trying to have a natural, unmediated birth. I came to terms with needing the epidural. I wasn’t dilating and the epidural wasn’t working currently for me either. So, at 3am, they rushed me back to the OR because I needed an emergency c-section since my baby started to not tolerate the contractions. During my c-section, I lost a lot of blood and kept passing out. My hemoglobin was under 7, but they didn’t want to give me blood after my c-section because I’m “young and healthy.” So, my body failed me by not dilating as it should. 
 I planned on exclusively breastfeeding, but my baby lost 13% of his body weight because I wasn’t producing enough. So, my body failed me again. 
 

 I’m snapping at my husband. I can’t sleep when the baby is sleeping because I feel like I’m failing as a mother and a wife. I want him to have the best life possible, but I just can’t get it together.

 It occurs to me that I should tell you from one mom to another. You will be OK even though now you are not OK, and it’s OK to not be OK.

13,352,352,352,"I am a FTM 3wks pp and suffering from depression, anxiety, and so much rage that I can barely function on the daily since my husband went back to work. I think I have lingering trauma from my birth experience as well - I truly thought I was going to die while I was having my baby.
 

 I try to meet my baby’s needs immediately, but she will scream bloody murder if I’m not fast enough and I get overwhelmed/overstimulated almost instantly. My husband says that babies cry for no reason and I can’t deal with the crying that just won’t stop. I’ve never done well with noises, I am sensitive to sound and have never coped well with it. I handle this by screaming back at my baby and then crying with guilt because she doesn’t deserve it. It’s a vicious cycle and I just don’t know how to stop it. Even putting her down in her crib in her room doesn’t help because our walls are so thin I can hear her shrieking. Then the anxiety of being away from her kicks in and I’m scared something will happen. I fear putting in headphones or ear plugs because how will I hear her if she starts to choke or something?
 

 My pride won’t let me reach out for help either, and I know how stupid that is. My mentality is that I wanted to be a mother for so long, why am I so desperate to escape it? I feel like a failure if I need to ask for help. Which is also ridiculous because I feel like I’ve failed my daughter already. I gave up breastfeeding because it was too much and I am constantly on edge/stressed out. Pumping has become an absolute waste of time because my production (which was already low after a complicated birth) is now abysmal and it just makes me feel worse. I struggled to give myself any credit, any grace, any kindness before I got pregnant and it’s worsened tenfold since my daughter was born. I am so awful to myself.
 

 I am overcome with emotions that are drowning me every day to the point that I want to end it all. I have an initial consult with a therapist in 6 days, but that feels like an eternity away. I have never been so mentally unwell in my entire life and I’m so scared that therapy won’t help me or that I’ll ruin my child. I don’t have fears of hurting her ever, but I do have a fear that my mental health will continue to plummet and I’ll hurt myself terribly. And no child needs a mom that is so at risk or that can’t find any joy in life. To make matters worse, my own mom died almost 8 months ago and I haven’t been able to heal from that. I miss her so much and I hate that I’ve had to go through this without her. 
 

 Her dad is a godsend because he immediately takes over when he gets home and on the weekends, he does his best to listen and validate my feelings as I break down into a crying mess every night, he wishes so much that he didn’t have to go back to work so soon after our daughter came. He has encouraged me to go to therapy because we both know he isn’t a professional and not equipped to wrangle what I assume is PPD/PPA/PPR. I love my husband so much and I feel so lucky to have had a child with him, but I feel like my child deserves someone better to be her mom.
 

 I just don’t know how to manage - how do you do it? How do you cope with these out of control feelings? How do you better acclimate to motherhood? Were there any resources or support groups that helped you get through? Was therapy enough? Did you need medication too? Looking for guidance, sympathy, or anything really.

When our second child was born, due to some circumstances, I was very limited in my ability to help for most of the first year of his life. This child was also very difficult breastfeeding and she was reluctant to give it up. All this amounted to her having some pretty decent struggles and eventually admitting that she may have PPD. 
 

 She started on anti-depressants or anxiety medicine over a year ago, but it has only helped a little bit. She has tried to come off of them a couple of times, but she can’t. The problem is, they are only sort of working. 
 

 She is always talking about how stressed she is even when there is nothing to be stressed about, she is always tired (2 year old still having sleep issues is partially to blame), and she is rarely happy. This has been having a negative effect on our relationship. I do everything I can to help out when I am home but we both have FT jobs and are burned out by the end of the day.

 With my first son, I want to say I had severe postpartum anxiety that cleared up by the 2 week mark. I can't remember exactly when, but it was time for my two week appt with my provider to check on my incision, I remember distinctly having a conversation with her about how I had the blues but was feeling better. I remember being up 24/7 crying all the time and refusing to sleep eat or do anything outside of take care of my son bc of how awful the anxiety was & I think it was so awful because of the lack of sleep..
 

 About 5 days postpartum partum this time, it hit me like a truck the same way it did with my first. I felt like I had ice or fire in my body and just cried because hated the way I felt. I kept replaying how I felt with my son and how awful it was.. The previous days, I would weep only when the sun went down and then after that I would be okay. After the 5th day, when I forced myself to get some sleep, I felt much better..I had some anxiety that lingered, and quite honestly at 8 days pp, I had SUCH a great day that I thought it finally ended for me. It came back slightly the next day but nothing severe. All of a sudden this morning at 6am it hit me again, and the anxiety is coursing through me and hasn't let up. I tried to sleep and for a whole hour I just was in and out of sleep waking myself back up with anxiety, it was awful... I know I've been through this before with my first, in the exact same way, I know that it passed, but had anyone else suffered with the baby blues really badly and it ended by the two weeks?? I'm so terrified this won't end soon and might take longer. I think having a timeline in my head makes it worse bc I expect to feel better by then.
 

 The reason I'm thinking this is just the blues is because I developed a form of postpartum depression with my first a few months after he was born... and it was significantly less extreme. I would get sad and cry, but it never kept me up at night or gave me severe anxiety. And the fact that I dealt with this exactly the same as with him..",,"currently  day pp extremely bad morning second baby go believe baby blue

24,523,523,523,"My 12.5 year old Pomeranian Eevee was diagnosed with late stage heart failure in May and was given 3-6 months maybe a year to live. We were given meds to keep her comfortable and to maintain her daily life. I was suppose to be due in September and had major anxiety she wouldn’t make it to the birth. She was my light and comfort during my pregnancy journey. I know I was suppose to mentally prepare for the worst but every day she looked and acted like the happy little pup except for the terrible coughing fits she had all day and night. I prayed that she at least make it to the birth to meet her human brother and she did since he came a month early in August and she lived up until he was three months. I’m starting to have a lot of guilt, that maybe I didn’t give her enough care or attention during my pregnancy and afterwards cause I was tending to my son and that she felt neglected when I had to close the door on her at night cause her coughing would wake the baby up. Then I felt bad that maybe I should’ve waited to have a baby so that her last years would be full of my attention. I start to think that maybe I could’ve taken better care of her health, done more for her quality of life. Then I also feel bad that I didn’t take enough photos of her and my son or even me and her. The day before she died she collapsed and I could tell she wasn’t right even when she got back up and was semi normal. I wanted to take her to vet but my son needed to feed and nap and by the time i finished the vet was closing and she didn’t seem bothered. I was gonna take her in the morning if she didn’t seem like herself again. I spent a little extra cuddle time with her before I had to put my son to bed and I don’t know why I said it but I told her if she was in pain and needed to go it would be okay and that I loved her. ( I feel selfish for thinking maybe if I hadn’t said that she would be here still and maybe she took it as I didn’t want her to stay anymore.) I woke up at 5am dec 10th to change my sons diaper and she raised her head to look at us but didn’t follow like usual so when I was done I came back and noticed she was laying too still. All i remember was a blur and she died in my arms. I feel guilty that she waited for me to wake up and she wasn’t the first thing I held or that I left her in the room for a bit before holding her. And now I can’t stop crying and feeling sad and I don’t want my son to feed of that I feel like a bad fur mom and a bad mom cause I just feel like I haven’t handled anything right and I can’t give my son my full attention without getting sad and seeing her during our normal day routine with him. Like I didn’t have enough time to grieve her before I dropped her at the vet cause my son needed me. Everything felt rushed and like a dream. I’m just overwhelmed with emotions. I just don’t know what to do anymore. My parents who originally didn’t want her but then feel in love are also sad but they keep telling me I have a son now and I need to put my grief aside for him. I know they mean well and they are very old school when it comes to emotion (Asian parents with very little emotions) but I just can’t seem to stop crying. When does this get better.

38,758,758,758,"So to start with some context, I have recently diagnosed audhd and I have had depression and anxiety from a very young age. I've gotten that under control with the right medications and therapy, but not without a handful of bumps along the way. I am so lucky to be married to my best friend and to be starting a family with him. He is kind and patient and funny and just the best I could've ever asked for.
 

 I have had some turmoil with my in-laws within the last 5 years or so that began when we overheard my (now) husband's mother scream crying that she didn't want him to marry me a few months into our engagement. (Now I know I'm not nearly as wonderful as my husband; I am tarnished with childhood trauma and I'm working hard to prevent spreading any of it to my son.) But she was a big part of my childhood (my husband and I were neighbors and good friends growing up), and I looked to her for wisdom and advice and she was a real inspiration to me. When she let out her true feelings that she didn't like me, my world shattered and I instantly threw up invisible barriers to protect myself. So we act totally fine and catch up like all is well when we see eachother, but I can only handle seeing the in-laws maybe 2 times a month. By the end of each get together I am drained of all emotional energy. They are inherently good people, but they are in their own little bubble they've established, with very few friends or family involved in their lives. It's hard to be one of the few people they have around, especially since my husbands brother moved across country last year. It feels like they're more reliant on us to fill that gap wince they're empty nesters now. When we slowly started to come over less, they seemed mostly fine with that, and the relationship with them felt much less rocky.
 

 I just gave birth to our beautiful boy last week and I have never been more happy in my life. Truly, I have never loved my husband more than when I see him being a daddy. I have never felt more purpose and contentment with my life. 
 

 However, the second our baby was born, my MIL has swept in to try to be with us as often as she can. It is my biggest pet peeve when someone tiptoes around their real intentions as if I'm dumb or complacent. My MIL is insisting on coming by everyday to drop off something to ""help"" us with. That sounds like the right thing that people should do for new parents, sure, and I'd love it if she'd been this way the last 5 years. But she has shown time and time again that she doesn't like me for her son and thus, this ""help"" feels transactional and wrong. I'd even let that go if she hadn't already blatantly disrespected us and our boundaries with the baby.
 

 It's often debated what boundaries parents set, and if they're reasonable or not. I made it clear throughout this pregnancy 1:do not kiss the baby by any means and dont put your hands on his face 2:do not invite yourself or others over.
 

 My in-laws kissed my son at least 30 times and when confronted said ""oh we agree babies shouldn't be kissed on the face, but we just did the top of his head"". Then I was told she invited aunts and other people to come see ""her baby"".
 Now I respect that she's his grandmother and she has every right to be excited and to love him. 
 I've been emotional as hell since this boy was born and it is almost all joy. But then the stress of having to set boundaries with this difficult person that I can never fully cut off has put me into a spiral. Every time she messages I feel my chest swell with anxiety and anger and I end up sobbing uncontrollably and screaming like a banshee at how mad I am at her. I then cry from how guilty I feel for being so upset when this should be the happiest time of my life. My husband has been the perfect dad and spouse and I've been making things so difficult but I can't control my emotions. My baby's eyes and my husband's hugs bring me back to earth but having a newborn is already hard on a relationship. I don't want to also have to be the bad guy with my MIL because ultimately, while I'd rather not have her in my life, she is my love's mother and I do respect that bond.
 

 I am sleep deprived and my body doesn't feel like my own. I don't feel like myself and I miss who I was pre-pregnancy. But I'm also so in love with being a mom. It's an absolute Rollercoaster. I'm joining a post-partum program soon, but I'm afraid a great deal of healing will only be able to be done if I confront my trauma and issues with my MIL. I'm going to offend her and probably mess things up for a little while but for my own sanity I think these feelings need to be addressed with the source.
 

 That was a lot but I needed to sort out my thoughts and vent. I already feel a little better now, whether or not anyone responds to this.
 

 Thoughts? I'm not opposed to hearing that I'm a pos daughter-in-law because I have considered that theory as well. I just love my little family so much and I want to keep all negativity put of this bubble that we're forming while we adjust to our new lives together.

39,764,764,764,"I am almost certain wife has PPA/PPR but she refuses to look into it or even read the descriptions of it I send her. It is our first LO. She insists she is the same person she was before, but she isn't. She's cold, cruel or indifferent to me (though she's slightly improved on this--from 100% cruel in all situations to being cruel only once a day but otherwise mostly indifferent--she did this, though, only after I gave her a mandate and deadline to stop screaming at me for leaving the microwave door ajar). I want to forgive her, but she gaslights me when I mention that her behavior is wrong and I can see in her body language that she still feels rage to me. (This from a woman who told me women use period pain as an excuse for their character flaws / bad behavior). 
 

 I try to be positive and help her recover. Her mom babysat for an hour with pumped milk and we went to have a meal at her favorite cafe. 75% of the time she was on her phone looking for items for the baby. She buys countless things that even the doctors have told us we do not need (e.g. a billerubin test device even though baby is now at almost normal levels and the doctors say it will resolve in a day or two). In the first few days, she cost us thousands of dollars by running overdrafts without moving some money from savings and I can only alleviate this by hourly checking that she hasn't spent another $500 on something and overdrafted (I mentioned it to her and she says it's my responsibility but i cant press because she cant take it right now) meanwhile I am the real villain for forgetting to take out the trash. 
 

 I'm up with the baby at night with her to burp baby, but she refuses to bottle feed so neither of us get significant sleep. (I also cook breakfast and clean and do diaper duty). She refuses to acknowledge the liberties her mom takes in our home (while MIL is also helping) and screams at me if I try to set healthy boundaries for MIL--such as not barging in unannounced while I am naked.
 

 Ladies: what did your husband do to help pull you out of this cycle? I sat her down to watch her favorite comedy TV show yesterday while the baby was feeding and she couldn't even recall what the 20 minute episode was about because the whole time she was reading something about the best soaps to buy for baby (we already have 5+ designer soaps for babies and the doctor said there's nothing wrong with her skin and to keep using what we're using but just to wash with soap once or at most twice a week).
 

 I'm thinking we can have a five minute dance off or something, but I've got to pull her up and out of this because she is destroying herself and our relationship too and I can't take this too much longer. I read somewhere that mental illness explains behavior, but it doesn't excuse it and there are / should be consequences. 
 

 My latest idea is to try to get her to dance for 5 minutes...silly but I'm trying everything.",,"almost certain wife ppappr refuse look even read description send first lo insist person not cold cruel indifferent though slightly improve thisfrom  cruel situation cruel day otherwise mostly indifferentshe though give mandate deadline stop scream leave microwave door ajar want forgive gaslight mention behavior wrong see body language still feel rage woman tell woman use period pain excuse character flaw  bad behavior

I’m so tired. Anytime I tell people that they say “well yeah, you’ve got three babies”. Thanks, not helpful. But..it’s like my soul is tired. I get plenty of sleep for the most part. But down to my bones I’m just..tired. Burnt out I guess. Tired of feeling unheard. My toddlers don’t listen to a word I say. “They’re toddlers”. Yeah, I know, thank you, but they LITERALLY don’t listen to a word I say. Something has got to change. They listen to their dad. He comes home and all I want to do is be listened to. Tell a story where he’s engaged, making eye contact, not changing the subject or saying “haha look at the baby” when I’m mid sentence. My kids don’t listen, he doesn’t listen. I stop talking mid sentence sometimes to see if anyone notices and they never do. I do so much for them, and I know if I died tomorrow, I’d be missed, but right now, it feels like everyone would just miss having clean clothes and food. My husband has to work a lot. Because We have three babies. And I can’t complain, because we’ve been blessed with three healthy babies that I’m able to stay home with. I can’t complain. Everyone tells me “you’re so blessed”. I know I’m blessed. I feel blessed. But I feel empty a lot of the time too. I cry so much more than I used to. I love my kids so so so much. But I feel like I’m just a vessel holding love for them. I’m nothing else. The old me is gone and I can’t find her anywhere. I have hobbies but little time to do them. I know this is just a season of life. My rational brain knows that. “These are the good old days”, “don’t wish their lives away”, “some day you’ll miss the fingerprints on everything”. I know. And part of the reason I cry all the time is the guilt I feel about that. I love them. But I’m so tired. But to wake up every day to the same stuff “no don’t touch that”, “don’t hit your brother”, “please don’t wake the baby”.. I’m so tired. I’ve never tried therapy but I feel like I need to. Something just doesn’t feel right. I’ve lost myself sometime in these past 3 years and every now and then I’ll get a glimpse my old self, but I can never get ahold of her for any significant period of time. I can’t afford therapy and insurance likely won’t cover it. Waiting to see if it’s approved so fingers crossed. I don’t want medication. I just need someone to listen to me. Even if they have to be paid to do it. I need confirmation that I’m not just a ghost, I do really exist and people can hear me. I’m also anxious, overstimulated, my needs are rarely met, and then, after a long hard day, I’m laying in bed and I get the tap on my shoulder from my husband. But my sex drive is absolutely gone has been since baby #1. “That’s normal, you have 3 babies”. I would love to feel normal again. But I don’t remember what normal feels like.

 Apologies ahead of time, a lot of this is ramblings I just need to get off my chest.
 

 

 My son was very wanted. I struggled for two years TTC, ended up having to do IVF and had our miracle baby. Since having him, I have good days where I just have all the good energy to play with him, but there’s other days where I just stare at him and think I’m not good enough to be a mom. I keep thinking he should have a better mom - someone who can care for him in ways I struggle to. I feel like he deserves so much better. I was holding him yesterday and I just burst out crying because I felt like I don’t deserve him. I had to immediately give him to my husband and walk away for a bit.
 

 My relationship with my husband is rocky, but it got worse since a few days ago because I didn’t think about something and my husband has had enough. Words exchanged can’t be unheard. He’s usually very loving to me, but last few days he barely speaks to me, which makes me feel very alone and broken as a person. He’s always been incredibly supportive and patient throughout our relationship. He says he still loves me, but something is different now and it’s severely impacting my mental health. Our relationship is literally hanging on by a thread but divorce is out of the question. And he isn’t the type of person who would ever want to do couple’s counseling. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, afraid of what I’m going to do to mess things up again.
 

 Most of yesterday I just kept thinking I don’t want to be here. The thought of growing older and actually being responsible in raising a child gives me way too much anxiety. I feel like I can’t do it. I had a good upbringing but I feel like I can’t do the same for my son because our house right now just feels broken. I have trouble planning ahead because I mostly just think about myself and what serves my needs. I’ve been like this most of my life that it’s been such a struggle for me to break free from it. I’m used to others planning stuff for me, but when I have to do it I get immense anxiety because I keep overthinking that it’s not good.
 

 I just don’t want to be here but I’m too much of a coward to do anything about it. I don’t want to live but I keep thinking about everyone I love and them wondering why I made such a selfish decision. I can’t talk to anyone about this because I know what everyone will say… but I’m really struggling right now. I didn’t know who else to turn to, so I’m posting here.
 

 I’m really struggling mentally. I just feel sorry for my son and husband that they have to deal with me. I’m just sorry all the time. I’m just… really struggling to get through the day.

 I think I have developed PPD, my doctor told me it was likely to happen do to me suffering from depression as a teen. Back then I hated myself, how skinny I was and how weak I was. From that I'd punish myself by cutting and I also abused alcohol. As I gotten older I grew to love myself more and now only drink wine recreationally. Fast forward, I started dating my best friend, we got married, bought a house together, are both students and he's also military, and I just pushed out our baby boy this Monday. I thought I'd be fine as I’d been only having an issue with accepting my new body during pregnancy. I never to account that my issue with feeling like a burden to my husband(he takes care of me a lot and its sometimes hard for me to see the things I do for him) would come to hunt me. After having our son I felt so absolutely happy. Things started to take a dive since I'd been struggling with all the pain that comes with labor, not being able to do much as you risk hurting yourself further, and not being able to breastfeed if you're taking medications such as opioids. With this being my current reality I've developed feelings of hopelessness, nightmares/trouble sleeping, feeling useless and pathetic, and overall feeling like a failure as a person and as a new mother. I realized it was hitting the lines of PPD when I started to feel like my husband and son would be better without me, like I didn't deserve the great treatment or happiness, and like I wanted to give up completely( let go of life) whenever the extreme pain strikes. My mind for some reason can't understand that its the first few days after labor, so of course I shouldn't be doing too much, of course I’ll have to wait to breastfeed(I've been pumping and dumping to keep up supply for when I can use it), and of course I’ll feel useless or like a failure due to small mistakes or not being able to fully help out or see the things I do do. I fully understand all of this, though even then, my mind is still beating me down, I've been crying so much and saying and thinking horrible things about myself. I fear I’m falling into a hole again, most of me wants to stay there. My husband is so supportive but sometimes I hate that he helps me so much, I feel like he deserves someone who’s stronger, more independent, has full confidence in their selves. I love him and my son more than anything in the world, but I can't lose the feeling that I’m holding them back.

My bf is amazing and supportive, however I feel the need to ""protect"" him from the crazy that is about to unfold with how raw my nerves and emotions are. I can feel the depression building and as soon as he walks out of the door tomorrow I am going to erupt in wailing and tears until I can fall back asleep. 
 As usual after giving birth I have 0 support other than him, no family or friends visiting, its just me, 4 walls, my newborn and resounding silence that echoes and goes on for hours. Ruminating about how alone i am in the world except for bf. Im lacking a woman in my life though and lacking that care that a female relative or friend gives- Instead its just me caring for everyone, no one spoon feeding me and waiting on me hand and foot as it should be, if only for a day here and there.
 I can't wait for him to leave for work in the morning so that I can let it all hang out, I want to cry and sleep all day without anyone around to be freaked out or upset by the ppd on display.

I have so many negstive thoughts in my head about my ability to be a mother, and even whether or not I want to be a mother.

 I made it clear before I gave birth the dog and baby don't get left alone together because neither understand boundaries and I know the dog would never deliberately hurt the baby but accidents happen.
 Last week the dog accidently jumped on the baby twice on separate days and made the baby scream and cry (no major injuries to the baby). Both times the baby was being changed by me and the dog got overly excited and jumpy and I'm starting to hate the dog because of it. The owner of the dog has been there when the dog jumps on the baby and I've had multiple near misses where I can push the dog before it lands on the baby but then I feel horrible for pushing the dog.

56,890,890,890,"I have a history of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, and pretty sure undiagnosed issues as well) and having my baby has made it so hard to cope. I feel like so many days are just me fighting for my life. 
 

 So back in February 2023 I got out of a longterm 4 year relationship (that's longterm for me atleast) and a few weeks after the breakup I started talking to who is now my current bf (we did used to talk back in like 2017, so he wasnt a complete stranger). My last relationship wasn't healthy on both sides and me and my ex really hurt each other so I don't think I ever gave myself anytime to actually heal, just jumped into the next relationship. My bf and I started dating March 2023 and actually got pregnant that same month. So as you can imagine everything's moving pretty fast. Well I also lost my job of 3 years, got evicted, been playing catchup with carpayments, lost another job and just keep on getting slapped in the face with lots of struggles. 
 

 I could feel the depression, anxiety, and rage creeping in during pregnancy but tried my best to ignore it. I did pretty well keeping a smile on the outside while I was going through a lot in my mind and physically. 
 

 Fast forward beginning of this year I gave birth to my beautiful sweet baby. My daughter had horrible colic up until around 4.5 or 5 months. It was the worse, no matter what i did she just would keep crying and crying. Sleep deprivation plus and crying baby does not mix well for an already mentally ill person. My bf was working a lot around the time (working during holidays in retail he was pretty drained). So when I gave birth he tried his best to be present but he was so tired it didn't feel like he was as present as he could be, or maybe he was and I just needed extra help. Not even a full 2 months into being postpartum bfs mom and I had an argument and currently 7 months and counting later his whole side of the family still won't talk to us. I have a very small family so I only have my mom and dad (they're separated so it's either one or the other). 
 

 About 3 months pp I went back to work and have been struggling to make it on time, I'm late every single day. I call in. I bs everytime I'm there. I get overwhelmed so incredibly easy. Thankfully I'm part-time and only work about 5 hour shifts a few days a week, but they're killing me. It doesn't help that I had to go to early mornings shifts. Waking up for for at 5-6am when I go to sleep at 12-2am nearly everynight is not for the weak. 
 

 We even have lots of financial issues going on, we had our electricity turned off 2 different times this year. 
 

 I don't mean to get into full detail about everything but I just needed you guys to understand the amount of stress's and change is just getting to me. My life has completely changed since last year and I have no idea who I am. I can't work on any hobbies of mine bc they require me to be focused and it's hard to do that with a 9 month. I'm constantly fearing of losing my job bc I can't get my shit together. I can't never keep the house in order and it's always either messy or needing something to do. I don't even do makeup anymore and I used to do it daily. I don't do anything for myself and I'm having a hard time doing things for my family. I feel so lost. 
 

 I love my baby so much but I never imagined having a baby honestly, especially this early in life. I feel so stupid for how things turned out. I try my best to be patient but sometimes I have the worse breakdowns. Lastnight I couldn't stop crying and screaming bc I just wanted to make some food and my daughter was tired but fighting her sleep really hard. It was so tough and I was all on my own. (Bf works until like 11pm-12:30am so I'm literally all alone). 
 

 Some days are so easy to control my emotions. I really do feel like the best mom ever and I'm so proud of myself but lately ive been in a slump and I get easily triggered by my bf, baby, cats, work, literally anything and everything. I kind of have friends but if I'm honestly speaking they're just old high-school/old work friends. I never really used to hang with them much outside of those places. My past relationship kept me from being to close to anyone so I pushed my many ppl out of my life. I don't have anyone that close to me. Sure I have some people that I know if I reached out to they could be there for me and actually understand what I'm going through but I just feel disconnected from everyone. 
 

 I'm not sure the point of me writing this, it's just been a lot and I want to feel heard and seen. I'm sure it'll get better eventually but I don't know how much more stress I can take. I feel like a horrible mom a lot of the time. it's just ne and my bf for the most part, occasionally I have my mom's help but she's getting older and has health problems so she can't always help out as much as she's like to. 
 

  Disclaimer: my bf treats me really well and he always tries his best to help me feel better and take over when he's home, but I know deep down he's struggling too. Especially since his whole family are basically disowning him atp.

 Of our 5 year marriage someone from his family (mom, nephews, uncle and sister) has lived with us ranging from 3 to 9 month stints and they typically come with some form illness or caretaking that he has to provide.

 Fast forward to today. My sister in law has been here for 7 months from another country and she just does not wash her hands. She uses hand sanitizer because I strongly push for it all the time but things like when she touches the trash bin outside and comes in or wants to start washing dishes, I’ll ask her and she thinks washing her hands without soap is an ok solution. There is a cultural difference and language barrier but I feel like I’m

Ive already set a boundary that I or my husband would be the only one sterilizing the bottles and pump parts so that’s good. But I had terrible PPA with my mother in law last year staying here and was not feeling safe in my home and while I know it would never be intense like that with my SIL. I’m just getting nervous especially because she cooks a lot and naturally ends up around things

60,920,920,920,I have undiagnosed postpartum rage triggered by being overstimulated and by my husband mostly. I feel like I am like one of those expensive firecracker fountains. The trigger lights the wick and every tiny thing creates a domino effect. My toddler has asked me to stop screaming and they told me that I scared them because I scream. I also do not spend as much time with then due to my work schedule. They do not act excited to see me either but they will greet and run up to my husband and other family members with excitement. I understand that I have probably traumatized my child and I just want them to feel safe around me again. How can I rekindle our relationship? I know it isn't too late.,,undiagnose postpartum rage trigger overstimulate husband mostly feel like like one expensive firecracker fountain trigger light wick every tiny thing create domino effect toddler ask stop scream tell scare scream also spend much time due work schedule act excited see either greet run husband family member excitement understand probably traumatize child want feel safe around rekindle relationship know not late,0,0.8042084873,0
61,921,921,921,"I have been so anxious about this since my baby was born , i had a really bad experience with my in-laws when i was 6 days postpartum and they were rude and didn't respect my boundaries. Now almost 4 months postpartum, my grandma had a stroke (luckily she has her memory and speech but her face is partially paralyzed) she lives in puerto rico , so i would have to travel there, i feel like everyone expects me to be there with my baby with or without my husband, my mother and step-sister were pressuring me about it, ive never travelled on plane by myself or with my LO and definitely not from CO to PR. Im scared that my boundaries will not be respected and i will snap at one of my family members ( an i wouldn't want to), i obviously want to go see my grandma and be there for her in her time of need but theres so many things i would need to consider, like ticket prices is a big one and i would need to get a portable carseat, the fear of my LO getting something like covid or rsv, long layovers and things like that, i talked to my husband and he said i dont owe anything to anyone, that i should do what is best for our baby not for everyone else, has anyone else had these fears?

62,924,924,924,"I'm just shy of 11 months postpartum with twins that are now corrected to 9 months. I am also currently in remission with cancer. My anxiety built tremendously during my cancer treatment and pregnancy exacerbated it. I went on zoloft at 29 weeks pregnant with 1 increase around 3 months pp. Things were okay, however, my husband and I are struggling with each other (he denies it and says it's all in my head) as well as lack of family support. I decided to wean/taper off the Zoloft to try to get my libido back and potentially help myself lose weight. What a disaster. I weaned over a total of 2 months or so, so very slowly. I'm also weaned down to 2 pumps per day. I'm a total mess. Hormones and feelings all over the place. I feel like a terrible wife and mother and I'm just angry all the time. Will I ever feel normal again? I'm also finally going back up to full time hours at work. It seems like my husband wants to compete as to who has it worse. This post is all over the place.

64,929,929,929,"I’m at the fucking ledge today…. But I’m talking myself off it because I don’t want to do that to my daughter. She’s almost three years old and with her birthday getting closer, it’s kinda triggering…. I hate that I feel like I don’t want anything to do with her (she wasn’t planned but we planned it anyway because I felt like I had to keep her regardless of my feelings; she was a surprise baby) I hate that I resent her because of all the trauma I went through when I gave birth and when I was abused by my ex spouse who is also a narcissist. It’s like trauma on top of trauma for six years and it fucking hurts. Trauma therapy helps me so much though but it doesn’t help when my family sometimes brings up the fact that I’m stuck with her regardless. Like, I didn’t realize that I actually had a fucking choice when I got pregnant??? No one told me this shit. He forced me to keep my mouth shut when I had CPS involved because of my PPD three days after I gave birth to my daughter. Now that she’s almost three, I’m really trying to bond and really connect with her but it’s so fucking difficult. I feel like I died when I she was born and I hate it. I still feel that way and I fucking hate it. When I was in the psych hospital, I was finally feeling better but when I was back in the abusive environment that I was put out of, it triggered soooo many self harm urges that still exist now. I’m out of there after six, almost seven years of being with my narc, but I’m struggling to even love myself, much less her….. I want to fucking scream. The distance still feels like it’s still there but I’d rather hold onto her when she’s with me and cling to the sacred amount of time that I spend with her than when she’s with my ex….. I hate that when she’s away from me for too long, it’s almost like she doesn’t exist in the first place and I hate it. What the fuck is wrong with me?? Like, I’m finally going through trauma therapy because of all the hell I went through, but I feel like such a shitty Mom for not wanting anything to do with my daughter some nights……",,fucking ledge today talk not want daughter almost three year old birthday get close kinda trigger hate feel like not want anything not plan plan anyway feel like keep regardless feeling surprise baby hate resent trauma go give birth abuse ex spouse also narcissist like trauma top trauma six year fucking hurt trauma therapy help much though not help family sometimes bring fact stuck regardless like not realize actually fucking choice get pregnant one tell shit force keep mouth shut cp involve ppd three day give birth daughter almost three really try bond really connect fucking difficult feel like die bear hate still feel way fucking hate psych hospital finally feel well back abusive environment put trigger soooo many self harm urge still exist six almost seven year narc struggle even love much less want fucking scream distance still feel like still rather hold onto cle sacred amount time spend ex hate away long almost like not exist first place hate fuck wrong like finally go trauma therapy hell go feel like shitty mom want anything daughter night,1,0.873903502,2
