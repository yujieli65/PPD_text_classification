"First time mom here. My husband recently started a new job working graves. In the past, my husband would not help much and get easily irritated when he did graves because of how it affects his body. I had many discussions with him on how I didn’t want him doing graves again because of the past events and especially when we now have a 7 month old baby. I’ve been dealing with ppd as well and have anxiety about being alone at night with our baby. Well, my husband started working graves regardless because the shift pays the most. It’s been a few weeks since he’s started and I’m already getting overwhelmed and stressed with everything. I work 10 hours a day and come home to care for my child, my dog, do chores, and still have to cook/pack lunch for my husband’s shift. We both have the weekends off, so I usually let him sleep the whole day on Saturday and ask him to help around the house on Sundays. He hasn’t been helping me though and would rather sleep the whole weekend. I tried to have a discussion with him today about how overwhelmed I am being the sole person caring for literally almost everything and all he had to respond with was “k”. I was so defeated and saddened with his response that I just shut down and walked away. I can’t just stop caring because I have to take care of our child and dog and it’s not fair to them if I shut down completely. It’s been so hard but my husband doesn’t care. I don’t know what to do at this point…",0
"I gained 80 pounds while I was pregnant I went from 125lbs to 205lbs by the time I gave birth and only dropped to 198lbs after birth. I ate healthy my whole pregnancy and kept relatively active, I even tried a small calorie deficit and nothing stopped me from gaining weight every single week. My whole entire body is covered in visible thick stretch marks even though I moisturized with bio oil and hyaluronic acids, I even have them on my arms. I’m breastfeeding, I was told my whole pregnancy “it will fall off during breastfeeding” and it didn’t if anything my body holds onto the weight and stores extra fat for my milk, I’m now 5 months postpartum I’ve been working out for 2 months straight and I haven’t lost more then 5 pounds and it’s such hard work… I spend what little personal time I have working out for 30-45 min a day or taking 45-90 min walks and nothing is changing. It’s ruined my mental health and body image and I’m becoming depressed about it now, I’ve since given up on working out I’m just eating like crap and surviving off protein drinks and apples and lots of liquids to keep my supply up. I wanted so badly to just be healthy and happy but I’m hateful and discouraged. All my friends and even other moms I know all look like themselves again after having their babies and I feel like it’s not fair I’m so bitter and angry but I don’t know what to do, I tried to do everything right and now I spend my days watching streams and laying on the couch, crying.

"i’m not usually one to ask for help when i need it but i know that when it comes to this topic it’s important to speak up when you need support. some days i will feel completely abandoned and alone by my babies father and like im doing it alone and then the next day ill be so over the moon about everything and be extremely thankful for him and all he does. idk it’s a weird time right now, im 7 weeks pp. should i be worried about anything or is it just a normal hormonal reaction to sleep deprivation!?

"I (31f) and my husband (34m) just had our first baby together. He is so sweet and I'm loving being his mommy! My husband is a great partner as well. I pretty much handle getting up with him at night because I breastfeed, but he will get up with me and change his diaper or just keep me company while I nurse. He is wonderful and I'm overall very pleased.

Despite this- I feel like there is a weird disconnect with my husband. I feel like while I'm excited about our new lives together with our son, I'm mourning the life we shared before. It's difficult to be intimate (I'm still healing so no sex - I'm talking about even just cuddling in bed together or trying to make time for the two of us) because our son seems to be a little ticking time bomb. Great baby but his timing is... Immaculate to say the least lol.

Does anyone relate to this? It's strange to explain because I'm happy and he is good to me and our son, but I feel like I'm mourning our old relationship. I will be ""missing"" him while we are eating dinner right next to eachother lol? So strange. ",0
"Hi there, 28F with 2nd baby. 6 weeks PP and wanting nothing to do with my baby. I DO love him, don't get me wrong, but I feel like I want nothing to do with him. I take care of him because I have to. I'm EBF and will feed and snuggle him, but after he's content, I give him to his dad or someone else. I leave the room and I dont want to be around him. I have a 3 and half year old as well that I often find myself losing my patience with quite quickly. Hes a very active three year old and can be very needy. I wish I could just leave my family but know I would greatly regret that and I need to be here. My family is not giving me the support I need and I feel like no one is listening to how I feel. What should I do? I have an appointment with my OB on Wednesday to talk about things but thinking of canceling it because I don't want to face it. ",0
"Hi, I 23F am 18m Postpartum with my daughter. I had a pretty difficult end to my pregnancy, she was breech for almost all of my 3rd trimester, I had 2 failed ECVs and overall just a very painful last few months. My daughter was not a planned pregnancy at all but my partner and I were very excited and happy to have her. Her delivery was very traumatic and everything that I had planned or expected was out the window. I won’t go into detail but she ultimately arrived via Emergency Cesarean. I struggle with the delivery still to this day, I used to find it hard when I found out anyone had a natural birth but I have since moved on from that to just resenting anyone who is pregnant. I don’t know why and it makes me feel so guilty and upset with myself. But anytime someone in my circle is expecting, part of me just can’t handle it. It makes me so overly emotional and sometimes mad. I’m happy for them, I know I am, I check in, I’m there for support but something inside of me just is crushed Everytime. I’m a mixture of mad but also just deeply depressed. I didn’t have any trouble conceiving, I love my daughter more than anything, even though her birth was traumatic I still am so happy we made it through together, I just don’t understand why I feel this way. Is this normal? Does this happen to anyone else? Am I a terrible person??",1
"Back tracking , I’m 24F, and my husband is 24M, we have two children under three together, and we live with his parents and brother and his wife, until we get enough money to purchase a house,

During this time, i do all the chores around the house, and buy groceries for everyone including cooking meals and cleaning up after every one, my sister in law helps partly , but she has a new born, and uses that as an excuse to do nothing, I do understand though a new born is hard to raise, 

I work from home normally, I put it about 8-9 hours a day, but I am able to multi task as I do everything though my phone! Seasonally I work in an office, and I leave from about 9am until 8-9pm ,

I work long hours with very needy and emotional people, 

My husband only works in the summer time then he leaves for bigger work in the winter for a few month- to weeks at a time. 


I love my children, but they do require a lot of supervision that nobody seems to do without yelling at them. 

Today, while I went to work I left my two children with my father in law and my husband, 


all I heard since I came home was how bad they were, how they had to change dirty diapers, feed them etc. 

And I am so freaking overstimulated and overwhelmed it’s not even funny,

I’ve been up since 6 am, I haven’t eaten all day, and I’m overwhelmed.

I asked my in laws, if they’re hungry because my husband was getting food,

Everyone said no, 

So my husband had only purchased food for us and our kids,

My father in law decided to yell at me and say how can I not have gotten my mother in law anything to eat as well, 

As I am about to eat, and I don’t know what to do about this frustration and anxiety I have inside of me 


I don’t Understand how much more I can do and do and do and still be reprimanded like I’m 17 years old and selfish, I’ve asked everyone in the home twice if they wanted something back,


I really think I’m being overly dramatic, 

And I think I pay way too much attention, 

But I got so frustrated I ended up not eating and giving up my food to give my mother in law. 

I did feel alot of guilt cause maybe i should have gotten everyone something anyways, but i really can’t afford that right now. 

I wish my husband would’ve stuck up for me. 

My husband plays a video game between 8-12 hours a day, I think he’s got an addiction and he puts it before everyone and everything 

I wish one day I could be important enough for someone in my life, and I really wish he cared enough about me to see how frustrated I am, or to see I just need a break 

I don’t know why I write these things out, and I don’t know what I want,

I think I want to be heard , I think I want someone to see how hard I try, and I just want someone to appreciate me ",0

"Hi All! I have PPD. I'm supposed to return to work Tuesday but I feel so low that I think I can't. I just had a panic attack thinking about it. Some background: my husband cheated on me whilst pregnant for my entire 3rd trimester until baby was 2 weeks old. My breastmilk supply had drastically decreased. I have a years savings as an emergency fund. After that is gone, it's gone. I'm on a low dose of Zoloft, the lowest. I haven't consistently taken it daily. I have to make a decision and feel my mind spiraling. I'm in therapy and couple's therapy. Any thoughts, advice, or suggestions please. ",1
"FTM and I love my baby so much it hurts, and I don’t want that to change but I can’t stop crying and being anxious about the world around me. I’m having a hard time sleeping too which is terrible because I need my precious sleep on my shift and I’m so mad that my brain won’t let me.

It’s always the worst in the morning and gets better throughout the day. I’ve been started on 25mg Zoloft that will be upped to 50mg today which I’ve taken before pregnancy just fine, but it feels like it hasn’t kicked in yet. I feel like all the oxytocin from the first few months has worn off. My love for my baby is strong as ever but I feel like I can’t take care of him as much as I should, even though I know that’s not true.

My husband has been so wonderful and supportive and understanding but when the hell will the meds work?? When the hell will this go away?? I’m also starting therapy again this week too so I hope that helps. People keep telling me it gets better but I want to know for sure…",1
"Hi everyone. I’m KC, and I’m so grateful to be part of this community. Like many of you, I found myself completely blindsided by what postpartum actually felt like, mentally, physically, emotionally, and systemically. After experiencing a traumatic birth, an unexpected C-section, postpartum preeclampsia, and feeling completely unsupported by the healthcare system, I wrote a book called The Alchemy of Motherhood (set to publish in 2026 by Cynren Press). I’ve also created a supportive Discord community.

Now I’m planning something I wish had existed when I was pregnant:

A multi-city, real-talk, in-person, postpartum prep focused on many issues not discussed during pregnancy, such as, birth trauma, identity shifts, mental health, and the truth most of us never hear before it hits us at 2 a.m. in the dark.

It would include:

-Honest conversations (not fluffy baby prep)
-Guest experts (like doulas, L&D nurses, pelvic floor PTs)
-Free goodie bags, info., snacks, self-care station/tools, and support

� Would you have gone to something like this if it existed while you were pregnant, or even now as a postpartum mom?

I’d love your honest feedback as I shape this into something truly supportive for mothers. Thank you for taking the time to vote.

"I have a toddler and a newborn, and lately I just feel like I’m drowning. I’m trying to be everything at once—a mom to two very young kids, a wife, a functioning human being—but I constantly feel like I’m falling short.

I want to be present and supportive for my husband too, but I have zero interest in sex or intimacy right now. I’m exhausted all day, and I never get a real break. I’m home 24/7 while he can still do things like see friends, go out, or just... breathe. I feel stuck and lonely.

I know these feelings might be part of postpartum blues, but I just needed a place to vent where people might understand. Anyone else been through this? How did you get through it?",1

"hi, 

i’m a FTM 6 month PP. I have struggled with PPA but i think now it’s settling into PPD as well. 

i have started to feel enraged towards my husband (i felt this early on in my PP journey but it went away, and now is back). I’m exhausted and overwhelmed and some days my baby frustrates me incredibly. i love her so much but in the past two months she had extreme silent reflux i didn’t recognize and it made her aversed to bottles, and on top of that she is teething. not to mention my own mother who lives in a different state was hospitalized for a week and luckily okay! i have been pushed to my limits of frustration, anxiety (couldn’t eat or sleep), every day i do the same thing just to make it through the day. i’ve reached out for help to my pcp and am hoping to try medication. Most days i feel empty and out of sorts, i have a lot of high points and low points in a day….. i don’t feel suicidal, just not much of anything except irritation and bouts of rage and perpetual anxious intrusive thoughts that im going to die or pass out all the time. 

i guess im looking to hear if you’ve tried medication how was it for you? 
if you had PPD did it manifest in similar ways? 
i feel like the shittiest mom alive most days because i let her watch two episodes of bluey so i can drink my cup of coffee while it’s hot and try to wake up enough to play. 
i have basically no help most of the time, my husband works a lot and night shifts…. but i think i still hold so much anger towards him because he should be able to function on less than 8 hrs of sleep, and he’s almost always getting 8hrs uninterrupted. i average probably 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night these past two months.

"So my son is 7 months old now and i have been living with my parents since 4th month of pregnancy. They are very supportive and take care of my baby , make his meals help with all his chores but i feel suddenly they expect me to grow up and act like a great mom like thats my only job now
I am a single child and was pampered throughout and I'm not complaining but certain comments they pass hurt and makes me feel like they dont care about me the same way. Sometimes its like you gabe birth and you should sacrifice everything and take care of baby. Plus living with i get no freedom of speech anything i discuss with my husband they interfere and ask what ? No personal space basically. I know it sounds like I'm being very ignorant of all the help I'm getting and acting pricey but i get so many instructions on how to fo things for him when there are easier ways to do things and more effective. I feel there is judgement on jow me and my husband dont take the tedious oay of doing the chores for my baby boy.
At times it just becomes too much for me to handle. I cant move back to my place cz my husband has office all five days and I cant manage alone. My dad also will be very depressed if we move to our flat cz he literally spends all his time with him or doing his chores",0
"Since my wife gave birth we've been on a rollercoaster. At first it was awful, shouting at me over relatively mi or issues, throwing things, threatening to throw me out, screaming at her mom--the whole nine yards of emotional imbalance. 

I suggested therapy. We went. Didn't work cause she considered it a waste of time and hid from the psychologist. 

But therapy did help in the sense that my wife tried really hard on her own to right the ship, so to speak, emotionally--because she didn't want to go back to therapy. 

Wife's gyno/primary recently told her that ""her hormones are not in balance"" or something to that effect, but wife says it's not post-partum and she doesn't need medication. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm on a business trip and I call my wife after the plane landed late at night just to catch up. I tell her that some medical bill we have to pay is bigger than expected and it will cut into our budget more than expected. 

She asks why. I try to explain with the limited information I have or can easily get on my phone. She says this is not enough info and I need to ask for more. I tell her, okay, I will ask tomorrow morning first thing. She won't drop the topic and keeps asking me why the bill is so large. I eventually say ""I don't know"" and she's like well didn't you read the policy, contract etc and she keeps pushing me to explain it to her. 

I ask her, ""please, I just wanted to give you an idea of the budget, can you just let it go and we can talk about it tomorrow after I have a chance to look into it?"" In response she keeps pushing me to explain it and I get frustrated, because she knows I don't have the answer but is externalizong her frustration on me. 

The next morning she says it was my fault for bringing it up and I should know she can't handle such conversations without having an explanation. 

I think this is not very adult of her. We were already planning to make some significant purchases and I just needed her to tell her so we can avoid dipping  into savings (of which we have plenty) to make it all work. 

My question is this: is my wife's inability to let things go / regulate her emotions a symptom of post-partum? How long do I have to deal with this? I can't be open with her or have any serious conversation for fear of upending the apple cart. It feels like I'm married to a child whom I have to constantly worry about upsetting. It also reinforces all the stereotypes about women I long ago dismissed. At this point, I am just exhausted with it all and need to know there is light at the end of the tunnel...",0

TW i had a traumatic birth experience. i was feeling contractions throughout the day and didn’t think too much of it being a ftm i thought that maybe it was just baby’s pressure because she was so low. the pain started to get more intense i called my sister in law who’s had kids to explain my pain and she said i should definitely go in. my water broke in her car when i got to the hospital they said i was 7cm dilated already. i waited and waited for the epidural because i was in so much pain it took forever the anesthesiologist was so insensitive he told me i wasn’t in pain and it was all in my head. when he did my epidural he yelled at me because the needle made me twitch it felt like he hit a nerve. then i got to pushing i was super determined to have a vaginal birth and boy did i PUSH. only to be told my pelvic bone is too narrow to deliver my baby so id have to have a c section my biggest fear ridiculous i know. i could see my reflection through the lights above me my insides being cut open. i knew something felt wrong �when they got my baby out and went to do the fundal massage i lost so much blood i was internally bleeding because my cervix split while i was pushing. my baby keeping pressure down there literally saved my life. i had to get lots of units of blood i feel so depressed and anxious now i wish i could enjoy my baby like i should but im literally bed bound and need help to the bathroom i feel so miserable and discouraged everything hurts so bad. on top of all this pain i have to look after my baby and its so fucking hard i haven’t gotten decent sleep since my surgeries because i’ve felt so unreal and nothing like myself i just want the old me back i know it takes time and pp depression is a real thing but i’m genuinely traumatized and don’t know how to handle this feeling. ,1
"Hello, My name is J, I am a student at Linfield University I am trying to learn more about postpartum depression for a project and would love to hear all about how postpartum depression has affected your mental health, physical health and emotional health",
"Hi, I am 7 months postpartum and would love any advice comments, similar situations help here.. 
up until about 6 months postpartum mentally I felt great- then one day right at 6 months pp I woke up and felt like a completely different person. Depressed, crying nonstop, anxiety then started to feel like I’m living in a dream constantly- I read this is called depersonalization or derealization. It’s horrible. 
I went to my obgyn and started Zoloft 5 weeks ago- I stopped crying but haven’t seen any improvements in the dpdr and constantly feeling like I’m in a dream it’s such a nightmare. I feel like I can’t connect with my baby or my husband because of this. 

I’ve started exercising daily, grounding work, starting therapy next week and doing yoga but nothing seems to help except when I’m not alone and being at home makes it worse for some reason. 

I feel stuck in this anxiety thought loop of thinking how I don’t feel normal all day long it’s consumes my thoughts, I can’t even remember what my thoughts used to be before all this or what it even feels like to be normal. 
If anyone has heard of this please let me know how you’re doing, and how you navigated this. Any advice or help is appreciated, sorry for the long post I could go on and on about this. ",
"Hello to this beautiful community,

I am in a unique position to help support a new Mom and her partner and I wanted to come here and ask-what do you wish your partner (or others) truly understood about PPD and your experience of motherhood NOT being what you had envisioned? ",
"Sorry for the long post in Advance! 
I feel like I’m not entitled to say I had a traumatic birth experience, but every time I think about it I can’t help it but cry and feel angry and overwhelmed.
5 weeks ago I had my second baby, it was all so fast, labor started around 2 pm and I didn’t leave to the hospital until around 7pm. It was a Sunday so the hospital was short staffed. When I got there I was 6cm dilated and ready for an epidural, nurses were very attentive and went through my birth plan and said they could do everything in my list. 
After I got my epidural I told the nurse I was feeling a lot of pressure and wanted to push a little, she said she would be back and 15 min to check and when she did I was already 8cm. She then said while she still had her fingers inside me “I’m just going to check something” and proceeded to do a membrane sweep without letting me know, right as she did it my water broke. She acted like nothing happened, so I asked “ Did my water just brake?” And she said yes and continued by saying “ I promised I didn’t brake it” which just sounded guilty to me, especially because I knew it was because of the membrane sweep since my water broke because of a membrane sweep with my first baby. The only reason I didn’t get that mad about it is because I had meconium in my amniotic fluid, so now we knew baby pooped inside and they would check some stuff when he was born. 
The nurse left the room and said she would come back later and check on me, fast forward 15 minutes I sent my husband to fetch the nurse because I could feel baby descending. The nurse came back and checked and I was already 10cm, she then proceeded to to tell the nurses outside to call the doctor. At this point I realized the doctor on call was not at the hospital and I told the nurse I had to push, she proceeded to close my legs and told me we had to wait for the doctor, she kept doing breathing exercises with me until the doctor got there which was 30 minutes later. I just pushed for 5 minutes and baby boy was born at 9, so just two hours after I arrived at the hospital. 
I know some people have had worse experiences but I feel like I could have advocated more for myself and in a sense I feel violated. Whenever I think about my experience I cry, it took me weeks before I could even open the email to answer the inpatient survey, I think the most traumatic part for me was the nurse not letting me push for so long and the whole time I was thinking that it might hurt my baby, when I voiced this concern the nurse said it was actually good for me because baby was descending on his own and stretching the birth canal slowly and I would not tear as bad, but at that point I didn’t know if I should believe her or not. 
I’m also mad that they didn’t call the doctor before knowing that I was progressing so fast and knowing it might take him some time to get there, I’ve read online that they usually call them when they are 8cm and I wish that would’ve happened in my case. 
In overall baby is perfect and the rest of my stay at the hospital was good and the nurses were perfect. I’ve recovered so fast, faster than with my first baby, but I just wish I would’ve had a better experience. I wonder if with time this feelings will go away or if it’s bad enough that I need therapy",
"Hey everyone! Last week I asked what truly helped with your postpartum depression, beyond the usual “sleep when baby sleeps” advice and WOW. Over 50 of you shared some incredibly honest, helpful responses. I wanted to compile the most mentioned and meaningful ones here in case it helps someone else scrolling late at night (because... we've all been there).

What helped moms the most:

* **Medication** (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Cipralex, beta blockers, progesterone, etc.)
* **Therapy** (especially with a PPD specialist)
* **Getting outside daily** (even just to the mailbox!)
* **Showering + basic self-care** (brush teeth, change clothes, skincare)
* **Getting out of the house** (errands, library, storytime, even just a drive)
* **Support groups** (like PSI, local mom groups, or online chats)
* **Letting baby play independently guilt-free**
* **Doing** ***one small thing*** **for yourself each day**
* **Cutting out toxic/unhelpful people**
* **Podcasts** (like *Mom & Mind,* highly recommended)
* **Late night phone calls with someone who** ***gets it***
* **Starting daycare/childcare when possible**
* **Having a creative outlet or hobby** (coloring, sewing, journaling)
* **Comfort food (**yes, the Cuban sandwich counts **�)**
* **Reminding yourself:** ***t****his will pass*

This community is incredible, and reading all your responses reminded me that we're truly not alone in this. If you're struggling, *keep going*. Healing isn’t linear, but it is possible.

Feel free to add more in the comments if something helped you that’s not listed. Sending love to everyone walking through it �",

"Hi everyone. I am 10 months in PPD and I don’t know if it’s going to ever get easier. 
My baby was born with EEC syndrome which means he has a cleft lip, palate and only two fingers and two toes along with skin troubles. My baby is more irritable than most due to problems with swallowing food or milk and generally the trauma of him getting over surgeries. Just as we get over one hurdle of him starting to get used to eating food we get another hurdle of him needing surgery again. I will support him the whole way but I worry this is going to be my baby’s entire life. With his clefts he’s having 4 surgeries until 8-9 years old then with his hands and feet it’s an indefinite number of surgeries. I really can’t shake off this is my fault even knowing that the syndrome just randomly pops up and it’s close to one in a million. I don’t know how to stop feeling guilty I feel like I ruined my baby’s life even before he was born. Does anyone have any advice on how to keep going? I’m running on autopilot and I’m too scared to think about feelings because I know it will be bad. ",
"Has any other moms navigated motherhood while being diagnosed with CPTSD? If so, what are your tips?

I am currently navigating both while BFing and I am struggling. I was prescribed prozac but am nervous to take it and I see a therapist every week. My baby is currently nearly 9 months old and I have horrible mood swings.",
"I keep typing things and deleting them. Idk what it is that I’m needing. I’m tired, and I feel alone. I hear stories that sound like mine but then either they’re doing much better than me or they have much more going on in the meantime, or both. I have my partner, although he’s almost always working or sleeping. I’m a stay at home mom, so I’m not having to balance a job on top of this, I’ve already talked with my OB about PPD (little one is 7mo) and have started on a medicine for it in addition to one I already took for anxiety. And I suppose it’s helping… I’ve only had one breakdown past couple days as opposed to at least one per day. But I’m still tired, worn down, not filled with too much hope. I see people saying they wish they were warned about how things would be while they were pregnant, but I was and all it did was put extra stress in those last few months and then still didn’t prepare me for what was to come. And even now as we cross all these milestones—crawling, pulling up, trying baby food, etc—I’m still hearing “oh just you wait…”. And when I’m pouring feelings and being told “oh all you need to do is…” it’s not comforting, it’s adding another thing to the list of things that I’m barely managing. I’m not taking care of myself. I haven’t bathed in I don’t know how long, and just got back the energy to occasionally brush teeth. I’m rarely eating yet I’m gaining weight. All my energy is going to her. I’m snapping on my partner, I’m distancing from friends, and I’m feeling alone. And I’m not having the “I look into her eyes and everything is okay” moment. And then I hear from people that I can stop being hard on myself and that I’m a good mom, but it’s a generic statement and they’re also unaware that I smoke. Never in the house and not when she’s awake, and I don’t breastfeed, but it’s true. So how great am I? I keep waiting on a cop to walk up and shake his head at me in disdain and tell me to hop in the car for bad mothers. ",

When I moved I thought it was odd that bf wasn't moving in with me but didn't want to press because his uncle (who he was living with) was helping me out with bills (still is as my job didn't transfer properly and I became high risk and bed ridden) but as time went his uncle got increasingly upset with the amount of time bf was spending here. That cause a bunch of issues but once I became high risk I got a note stating he needed to be at my house more to assist with the daily dose (i.e sweeping, vacuuming, helping lift the kids and basic things you shouldn't do as is pregnant but because of his uncle wanting time I had to do more) that didn't sit well with his uncle and it caused even more tension. I have been told that because he's paying for everything I should be fine to give time up no matter what happens during the day (even though he'll leave at a moments notice for his uncle and be gone hours if not the rest of the day) under normal circumstances there shouldn't be an issue but nothing about any of this has been normal. I e expressed several times his uncle and his relationship has made me and others very uncomfortable but I've been I'm being too hormonal as well as expressed how I need more help some time and days like today our oldest was crying to go hang out with dad. I asked if he could for a couple of hours and was told no because his uncle has a minor flare up of his shingles (which we had discussed how he can still watch her the night before because it's a minor flare up and she's 3 years old and listens fairly well especially when explained that she can't touch him cause of as she says owies) so I have now been left with a heart broken crying child while trying to keep my own sanity. Meanwhile he is out with his uncle having fun and relaxing playing computer games and going for rides around town or out for food just him and his uncle. 

 I just broke down crying in the kitchen because my house is a mess from him claiming to clean it so I can relax with the newborn and yet nothing has been done. Then I see and hear about all he's doing with his uncle and how his uncle is buying him over $600 in model train stuff while I'm struggling to make sure me and the girls have at least necessities but I feel so awful because I just sat there crying and thought how I wish I was like him and didn't have my children and could act like him and hated myself so much for it ",
"I feel terrible. I feel so irresponsible for getting pregnant. I’m dooming this baby to a life of misery. I can’t create a better life for my child than I have. She’s doomed to live with crushing debt, expenses I can’t help to cover, working a job she’ll hate to afford to survive, a dying planet, a broken economy, and probably growing up without a mother because I don’t know how much longer I’m going to make it",
"I'm 4 months PP with OCD, chronic illnesses (fibromyalgia, EDSIII, narcolepsy), PTSD from birth trauma, and PPD. When do I get my life back? When do I feel normal again? My normal included not sitting on the edge of my seat all the time, taking a shower without hearing phantom cries, eating when I needed to, and being able to flush the damn toilet without waking someone up. I am so tired. Bone-deep tired, exhausted. My soul is tired. 
I want so badly to be the mom I see at Publix who's got her hair and make up done and is carrying her little bitty baby around the store while she shops. She looks so much more put together than I did prior to having my baby. How? How do they do it? I don't understand.",
"Honestly feel alone even when my partner is there. Like he’s there but not really there. Anything he does, pisses me off easily. I get mad easily. I know he changed a lot for this family but idk whats up with me. I’m 8m pp and idkkkk I feel like shit im so tired feel like im doing everything alone and i just wanna cry and die but also not leave my baby :(((( :(((((",
"I don’t know where to start. I feel like I need some reassurance that everything is going to be okay. I am 4.5 pp and struggling. Feeding didn’t go as planned. I hoped to breastfeed, but a high palate, tongue tie, poor transfer made for exclusive pumping instead, which is so much work. I also have supply issues, so that adds a great deal of stress.

I was doing okay, but the past few weeks, my ppd/papa has ramped up and I feel absolutely paralyzed by it. I have so much anxiety over whether I am doing the right things for my baby. Baby has become fussy on the bottle and doesn’t feed as well during the day, but feeds 2-4 times during the night. So we aren’t getting much sleep. I wonder if I am totally messing us up by feeding so much at night. 

I am also super worried that we haven’t sleep trained. I read so much on here that says people have babies who sleep through the night and put themselves to sleep. My baby has never done this, so I am worried I am screwing this up too. 

I am also just filled with general anxiety, dread, sadness. I have tried Zoloft twice, but it makes my symptoms so much worse. I am currently on day 4 of the second attempt to take it and am considering stopping again. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Does it get better? ",
"I just need to vent. Why does my baby's face make me smile and cry. How can I feel love, fear, happiness about who my baby will grow up to be but sadness about who I was and how much freedom I had but now it's just GONE!! Everything is on a schedule but as soon as I get use to it, the schedules changed cuz my baby is growing and we've entered a new stage of life / motherhood. I'm exhausted all the time but will wake up if my baby makes the slightest noise. She's so innocent and wide eyed. Why am I so afraid of everything? There's so many things that can happen, I'm just trying to keep my baby alive and happy.

So I cry everyday going back and forth between grateful and fearful. I can't watch certain TV shows, commercials or movies because the idea of any child, especially mine, being sick or hurt makes me cry. The idea of anyone hurting any child on purpose makes my blood boil. The thought that anyone would do something to my baby makes me want to set the world ablaze.

Ok.... I'm done 
Sorry about any spelling mistakes or grammar errors. I'm to emotional to care. ",
"I am 3months post Partum after having my baby 8 weeks early with a 4week stay at the NICU. I am EP because my baby isn’t interested in taking the breast. Pumping has taken so much of my energy that even though before pregnancy I could live on 4 hours of sleep, now I am barely hanging on with a consistent 6 hours. My husband is constantly comparing his tasks (washing pump parts, throwing in laundry) to me pumping every few hours and healing from a c section. It’s triggering my post Partum rage to where I am now throwing things at him. He is acting completely shocked at my behavior but he consistently says things like “I don’t know why you couldn’t do x chore” or “I’m tired too”… I feel so under appreciated and sad and I am so angry at him for even trying to compare what I feel to his issues. He is always overly defensive of himself and won’t just take on extra tasks or tolerate my moodiness and will take baits of fighting to where he is screaming at me. I feel like I married someone too prideful to honor his pp wife and put my needs first and center instead he has to make sure I know how tired he is as well.

Not to mention his family started a huge feud with me while I was pregnant accusing me of moving to a house too far away to separate him from his family and he and his mother are no longer speaking due to this. He is supportive in this situation but it did not help me to have a healthy mental state during pregnancy and after having such a traumatic birth experience. All of this I feel has added to my stress pp",
"I am coming here because I don't know where else to go and don't want my friends and family to hate my husband. I can't get over how he treated me through my pregnancy. He stayed out overnight twice and turned his phone off, and I had no idea where he was or if/when he was coming home or if he was with someone else. **One of those nights was on my birthday**, while I was 14 weeks pregnant. Now we have our beautiful daughter, who is perfect and the light of my life. I also can't help but potentially regret having a baby with this person who can treat me like this. Not only did he do those actions towards me, he has said awful things to me like he hopes our daughter doesn't look like me and that I do nothing (even though I was working full time, taking care of our dogs and house through the entire pregnancy)...

I  keep ruminating on how he acted towards me throughout my very challenging pregnancy.I am having a very hard time getting over this and I can't stop crying. Obviously there is itense animosity that is seeping into our relationship. He has also continued to say he did not cheat on me, but how will I ever know? He has continued his harshness towards me through this tender time of postpartum as well saying I am a failure for stopping breast feeding when My supply was extremely low. I am not sure what to do, who to talk to, or where to go. My heart is so hurt.",
"Hey guys.. I have been debating on taking my Zurzuvea. But I'm struggling so bad with PPD and PPA as well as rage. I breastfeed and my dr knows this but she felt that the benefits outweigh the risks and told me to just keep an eye on the baby and make sure she doesn't get too drowsy. 

Has anyone taken this and breastfed? What was your experience? I feel like an awful mother putting myself first and taking the medication. I took to tonight for the first dose and I'm terrified. ",
"Is anyone else just completely overstimulated by their dog? I love him to bits but ever since having our baby, our dog frustrates me. 

He’s a GSD and he’s very active and hyper. I had told my husband years ago that he needed to calm down (we had been TTC for a few years) and I knew this would be a problem once we had a baby. Well now we are here and I fear for our baby around our dog, it gives me anxiety that he may step on her or something like that. 

My husband is deploying and it’ll just be me with the baby and dog. I’m at my wits end and I don’t know what to do. 

Please tell me this is normal and it’ll pass. ",
"Wow I can't believe l'm writing this but tbh I have no one to say this to. I mean if I ever say it out loud I would be judged hard. I've tried to say it to my mom and my partner and oh god they told me not to say it again. But in reality I absolutely HATE been a mom. I love my baby, she is so sweet and adorable. A really good baby so far (she is 8months). I just miss my life and my freedom. I miss going out whenever I wanted, grabbing coffee or shopping, or even showering without her chasing me around and screaming most of the time. I can't even take a sht in peace.
I can't plan on doing anything fun cause I would have to find a sitter for her. Oh and the not sleep is the worse. It changes my mood. I used to be such a happy bright and smiley person. Now I'm mostly angry all the time, regretting been a mom. And don't even make me start on how my relationship dinamic has changed. (So far I have a great partner but still IT ISNT THE SAME) I would never let anything bad happen to her. But if my partner and I ever separated I would give him custody.
I know I would not be happy or capable of raising her alone. And even if I could I just don't want to do all the work alone. How is it far for only women to have to keep the kids?! Honestly ridiculous. I also feel like my mood swings are up and down A LOT. Idk if it's the hormones fro v having her 8 months ago or what. A lot of tin. get angry super easily at my partner and say really mean things. I can go from 0 to 100. I also have 0 sexual cravings. None. No idea why.
Before that(even when I was pregnant I would be sexually active). Now I just feel ew about it.
I don't get why women don't tell you how horrible been a mom actually is. NOW that I have a baby some other mom have say bad things about motherhood but not before! Like why won't they warn us??! I hate women now for that too. If I even got pregnant again I would not have it. Period. Idc how bad it sounds. I truly don't.
Becoming a mom is the biggest mistake of my life. And this short paragraph isn't even half of the bs I'm going through. And if other women ask me I would be try honest and tell them is horrible, I hope I don't get judge but if they the truth I'll give it to them.


**This was my original post at a different subreddit, then a mommy suggested I might have postpartum depression. Which made me wonder if I do? 
I’m not crying or sad, I’m just angry and annoyed I ever had a baby, I miss Me, my freedom, my old life. I’m miserable everyday (not all day but a big part of it) 
Sometimes I think about leaving my partner and the baby and start a new life.
Is this normal?? 

I do not want to take medication for this so I don’t see how just talking to a therapist might help???

Any advice or anecdotes I can relate to?? 

Thanks",
I don't feel like I want to harm my baby or anything. But I feel like I generally feel low grade sadness and want to know if it's because I'm 6 months postpartum or just coming to a realization that I'm not happy,
"Normally wouldn't post but I don't know if i should be worried or not. Im 2 weeks post partum with our first baby, im a stay at home mom and am doing 98 % of baby care along with house chores ect. I have been diagnosed with depression for about 15 years or so and before pregnancy has a pretty bad eating disorder, during the pregnancy i ate a lot and often i guess normal but since giving birth i find myself stressed, depressed and hardly able to eat. For context before the pregnancy i ate maybe twice a week. Am i having post partum depression or am i over reacting and just worrying about nothing?",
"Just as the title said. I had no idea postpartum would be this difficult. I've suffered from depression my whole life and am in therapy, and I recently did a stint of TMS which seemed to help. (I've had no luck with SSRIs, that's why I had the TMS... for treatment resistant depression.) After a couple months (and a rather traumatic vacation), I feel like I'm back to my old depressed self again, but worse. 

My moods are just up and down, I'm chronically tired and irritable. I literally have no appetite. And this is all exacerbated by a preliminary diagnosis of possible motor neuron disease, which I'm pretty sure I don't have. (But with a death sentence like that hanging over your head, it's hard to not think about.) I've been to multiple neurologists but they all say the same thing based off of one EMG and one NCS. I'm pretty sure I'm just dealing with malnutrition stemming from having an eating disorder most of my life and not eating enough during and after pregnancy. I also just found out I have celiac disease, am anemic, and have low B1 but high B6. (The high B6 is from taking my prenatal all the way up to 9 months.)

All of this just makes it so, so hard and I can't enjoy my baby at all. I just get so frustrated when I can't change his diaper because my thumbs don't work or because I can't get him down for a nap, or can't carry him because I'm so weak.I feel like a really crappy parent. My breast milk supply is super low and I'm trying to get that up, too. But of course, that takes calories, right?

My husband has been great. He's been an amazing help. But I just feel so alone. This is the loneliest and most isolated I've ever felt in my entire life. I can't turn to family because they're far away and my in-laws just wouldn't get it.

I'm just looking for light at the end of the tunnel but I just don't feel like that exists. 

Thanks for listening without judgement.",
"Everything has been great for the most part besides the usual not enough sleep, but my baby is sleeping better now.
I've recently (within the last 2-3 weeks) had a major confidence decline. I look at other women and moms and wonder what's it's like to be that little or to fit in those clothes? I lost 15lbs during pregnancy because I was gestational diabetic and watched what I was eating. After I had my baby I gained weight because I could eat normal again.
I can tell I'm more anxious and get mad so easily now about little things and big things that I haven't before. 
I don't feel sad, but I'm so nervous to ask my husband if he's happy in our marriage because I know me being angry more now and my low self esteem bothers him...",
"I (F28) have had two babies over the past three years and my ppd has never gone away since having my first child. It seems to just be getting worse. I’ve gained a lot of weight which really bothers me and been drinking a lot to cope with that and the depression. I keep waiting for things to go back to normal but I’m worried this is just my new normal. Feeling hopeless. I feel like a bad mom for being sad all the time, but I love my kids more than I ever thought I could love anything. It’s been almost a year since I last gave birth. When did you start to feel normal again? Ever?

I should add that I’ve been talking to a psychiatrist and have tried anxiety & depression meds for a few months now but they don’t seem to be helping at all. I’ve tried therapy in the past but it’s just not for me.",
"I'm 8 months pp and find myself feeling depressed and alone. I have feelings that I am unwanted and everyone's second choice. I feel like no one really wants to be my friend I'm just around so they are friendly to me. I have intense jealousy when friends hangout or talk without me. Last night I texted my best friend several times about random things. Much later that evening she said sorry it was a crazy day, which is cool but today a different friend was talking about their phone conversation that would've been during her very crazy evening. It has me feeling incredibly upset. 
Also I feel I have no one to talk to about it because I don't want to tell my friends I feel like no one wants me and then they feel obligated to talk to me more often out of pity. 
I do have my husband and he is supportive as best as he can be but he doesn't really know what to say to make me feel better. ",
"I feel guilty for being depressed. I had a super smooth pregnancy, insanely smooth birth, my baby has been an angel.  Hardly cries, started sleeping through the night at 6 weeks, although she barely naps during the day.  I'm about 4 months PP.  I have been home with her nearly the entire time.  My husband has been working non-stop.  I actually quit my job to be home with her, and will start working part time soon on the business my husband and I own.  He has literally been working like 16 hours days since she was about a month old.  I have it so easy.  I should feel so happy that I don't have to go work for someone else anymore, that I can work when I want because we own our own business and we're building something that's our own, that we can be proud of and are passionate about.  I have freedom. I feel very connected with my daughter and we have a strong bond.  I just can't help feeling so lonely and honestly bored.  I think to myself that it would help me to be working again, so I've been trying to find people to watch her so I can get work done, thinking it will help me feel more accomplished.  I can't find the motivation to even get started though, I just stare at my computer not able to get anything done and then I feel anxious about not being with her.  I try to get work done while I am home with her, and I feel guilty for not paying attention to her. I feel so lonely.  I think I'm getting better and then talk to my husband about it and he ends up making me feel worse than I already did.  Constantly offering suggestions on how to help myself, and just put her down and get some work done.  ""surely you can get some stuff done while she naps"", etc.  It just ends up making me feel like I'm not trying hard enough to be productive. I  can get the chores around the house caught up, but not much else.  I go for a walk to get outside and I feel better for an hour then feel like crap again.  Same with working out... try to get my heart rate up to burn off steam and I feel better momentarily then back in the dumps again.  I am definitely the type that wallows in my self pity instead of doing things that could help me feel better.  I'm also a very anxious, shy person, so even going out to SAHM groups or things like that feels daunting.  I can do it, but I really have to work up the nerve and be having a good day.  I even feel like I barely have friends.  I have some good friends I've been friends with since grade school but I don't always feel like I click with them anymore.  I'm kind of a one-friend type of person.  Once my husband and I met, and my closest girlfriend moved away, my husband become the new do-everything-with bestie.  I just had a birthday and no one besides my mother-in-law did anything for me besides send a text or facebook post.  Normally I wouldn't even care but, it was just the icing on the cake of an already shitty week.  I don't want to be on medication, it's just never worked well for me.  numbed me too much.  I need to start therapy but even that I feel bad for because of the cost.  I just feel so stuck.  I hate that my brain is just not allowing me to be happy when this is literally the best my life has ever been. I've always had a negative mindset and struggled with confidence but this is the lowest I've felt in a while.  ",
"Hi, I am 37 and this is my third baby. My first is 15 I had sever PPD that I disconnected from her up until she was 5. My second is 9 and I didn’t suffer from PPD. With him I felt I had the most wonderful pregnancy and postpartum recovery. My 3rd is only 3 weeks old and I feel like I am broken once again. I already suffered severe depression before pregnancy. This last pregnancy was very difficult. I found out I was pregnant 2 days before my husband’s terrible accident that caused him to have a severe tbi. Fast forward to March 5th, I was in labor 18 hours and I felt alone. I did have my mother and my cousin with me but not my husband. He was home with our son but even if he could have been at hospital with me he wouldn’t have been a good support. My baby came out after a rough 18 hrs with a broken clavicle and she was also revived due to her swallowing the Macconium( I know spelled wrong)   . On March 7th I was diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia and was hospitalized 3 days. I am now home feeling guilty and just alone. I am blessed to have my baby alive, my kids healthy and my husband alive. But it feels like I am alone and just worthless. I tried the suicide hotline but they were of no help. They just kept asking me how I was planning on doing it. Which I never said I was. (Sorry so long)",
"I’m 3 weeks pp, and I have a gorgeous little boy whom I absolutely adore. But sometimes I just feel like I’m in “survival mode.” 
I’m worried I may be showing signs of Postnatal Depression. I don’t feel hopeless or have intrusive thoughts, or anything the health visitors/midwives ask. Nothing like that. I just feel kind of empty sometimes. And general sadness every now and then. I’m not really tearful or stuck in the house. I’m always out and about doing something with my partner. But in some ways I’ve started to almost resent being around him. I have a history of situational depression and anxiety, but nothing “severe.” I’m terrified this is the onset of postnatal depression…can anyone relate?",
"Basically I have been through a lot. I have 19 month old son. We have been through DV from his father and we also got homeless after we left his father because of the DV. Ever since the break up I have had people complain when my son cries no matter where we live. Both shelters had the other residents complain to the staff about my son being loud. And after we moved to a hotel we had the staff at the hotel threaten to kick us out multiple times because of him being loud. We have a home now but now I still have people complain about him. My roommates complain about him to our landlord. (Our landlord is the owner of the home and she rents out the rooms to me and the other tenants). 

I can't afford my own place without roommates yet and I also can't stay with family. The only time people never complained about him was when his father and I were together because we did not have roommates and our neighbors minded their own business. (We did not really socialize with out neighbors.) But even if people complain about him in public I think they would not have said anything if they saw his father with us.

Well today I think I snapped. He kept screaming so much to the point where my ears started hurting. I then covered his mouth (i did NOT cover his nose) cause my ears were ringing and i won't be able to handle another complaint from our landlord. I kept screamimg at him telling him to stop while I was covering his mouth (again his nose was NOT covered cause I still wanted him to breathe. I just wanted him to stop screaming) he kept trying to take my hand off and i started singing outloud ""Everyone yells at me when my baby cries"" just hoping my roommates hear ME so they know what I am upset about. Especially since they think I am too lenient with him and some of them even suggested I should spank him. (I don't agree with spanking at any age but I especially don't agree with spanking someone his age cause thats even worse).

After he calmed down I noticed he had scratches on his face and realized the scratches are from him trying to take my hand off of his mouth. (His nailes are long cause he won't let me cut his nails.) And I know I did not scratch him cause 1) I was not trying to scratch him and 2) my nails are not long at all. Also I know he was still breathing cause he still kept screaming. And again his nose was not covered. I was not trying to hurt him at all. I was just trying to get him to be quiet so that he does not get us evicted from all of the complaints.

And giving him a hug does not calm him down either. All it does it make my ears ring cause he will then scream in my ear. 

I feel bad but I feel like anyone in my situation might have done the same thing. 

My son also has a habbit of kicking me for fun. If I sit on the bed while he lays down on the bed he will start kicking my back and laugh at me. He also kicks me when I brush his teeth but he does it in an angry way cause he hates when I brush his teeth.

I googled what I did and it claimed that covering a kids mouth could possibly lead to suffocation but that did not make sense cause I did not cover both his nose and his mouth. Only his mouth to stop the sound. And he was clearly still breathing cause he kept screaming even during that. And I was not trying to hurt him. I was just trying to not get evicted. And i have also seen plenty of parents cover their kids mouths as a last resort before to keep them from disturbing others.

Idk... i don't like what I did but I also did it mainly out of panic. The only time I get time away from him is when I go to work. And I am at a point where I think I am happier at work cause then I won't hear him screaming and I won't hear other people complaining about him screaming either. I feel horrible saying that cause I know lots of people talk about how kids are a blessing but in my case I feel like having a kid became more of a burden. Especially if you lack a social support system. And have to worry about other people being assholes cause they hate children. They already knew I had a kid when I moved here. I don't understand what they are surpised about.

"If you're in the thick of postpartum and feeling a little lost, lonely, or just craving connection, I get it. I started a postpartum Discord space for moms to talk about the real stuff. The sleep deprivation, the identity shifts, mental health, grief, the small wins, the hard days, and everything in between. No pressure to show up a certain way. Just a place to be real, ask questions, vent, or sit in the company of people who understand.

"I’m still too in the weeds from this morning to be able to concentrate enough to share all the context I think is relevant for this question.

But alas here I am asking, begging for a community to help me because I don’t know what to do. This isn’t sustainable, I thought I knew how to handle PPD and hormonal changes from my first pregnancy in 2021 but this new flavor is even worse.

I am angry. So angry. I’m having temper tantrums. I will raise my voice, stomp, punch pillows or couch cushions or scream at the top of my lungs when my 4 month old wakes up in the middle of the night and I can’t get her back to sleep easily. My senses are so heightened and idk how to get them to come down. Every sniff from my husband, breath or movement from our dogs just keeps me stewing. I go from being asleep to an insane level of rage within seconds. 

I stopped pumping completely 8 days ago. I somewhat slowly weaned myself down to pumping less and then used Sudafed to finish the job. I know I’ve messed with my hormones, but I thought the costs of pumping were outweighing the benefits. I was kind of an over supplier if that matters. 

I know this is all normal, I know this is expected. Thank you to everyone who cheers us on and says “it’s so great you’re aware!” But it makes me feel nothing. Being aware isn’t the solution. 

I’ve made a tele-health appointment with my OB for next week and plan to contact my therapist and psychiatrist as well. But in the mean time what do I do? What can I eat or drink or do that will make this easier? When will I stop screaming at my family and come back from being this monster? 

I’ve been in therapy and on some kind of antidepressant or anti anxiety medicine since I was 15 (now 34). I take an NDRI (aplenzin) and an SMS (trintellix) daily. I’ve been out of my trintellix for a few days while it’s restocked at the pharmacy.",

Just want everyone to know you’re not alone and sometimes talking about it can make it less scary and lonely.

"Our son was born a month early in January and he is very healthy and well-behaved. The birth (and aftermath) were very traumatic for my wife (32 hours of labor, emergency c-section that was pretty gnarly, she was stuck in her bed while he was in the NICU for the first couple of days and missed out on that bonding time; she has since been hospitalized twice - once for anemia/pre-eclampsia/UTI, and once for serotonin syndrome). She has always struggled with severe anxiety and depression and is in SUD recovery, but she says that she was doing fine caring for him and loving him until I went back to work ab a month ago. I WFH and so I have always been right on the other side of the wall and will relieve her/take over when I wrap up with a client or have a free hour or so. She has been working with her psychiatrist to find the right treatment for her depression, but today she came into the kitchen crying and told me that she did not care about our son, that she wouldn't do anything to harm him but that she doesn't think she would care if something happened to him and that she doesn't want to be a mother.

Me and the baby are going out of town this weekend to visit my family, and her close friends are in town to spend some time with her (one of them also experienced severe PPA), but I don't know how I can help or what I can do after this weekend? I don't feel like I can ask for any more time off of work, I already burned all of my FMLA time. And she is scheduled to return to work next week (and he is supposed to start daycare on Monday), but now I'm thinking that maybe she should take some more time (her boss has already offered it) while we put him in daycare, so she can have a little time to herself. So, like I said, not looking for psychiatric advice (against the rules, I know, and I'm and therapist and my FIL is a psychiatrist), just looking for any shared experiences ya'll may have had and/or any advice for a new dad/old husband looking to help my family. Thank ya'll.",
"Hey everyone! I’m 5 months into postpartum and navigating the ups and downs of PPD. I feel like I’ve heard all the standard advice: sleep when the baby sleeps, get some fresh air, ask for help, etc. But honestly… sometimes that feels impossible

So I want to hear from you:

What actually helped you start to feel even a little bit better? 

Big or small — a habit, a mindset shift, a conversation, a type of therapy or medication, a podcast, anything. Bonus points if it’s something that worked during those especially hard, lonely, middle-of-the-night moments.

Let’s crowdsource some real-deal support for each other

I'll go first in the comments �",
"Just wanting to vent and need comfort.
Every since I could remember, I wanted to be a golden mom. I wanted to be one of those moms who gives my all to my baby. I wanted to breastfeed and purchased milk bags and pumps during my pregnancy. When my baby came out 4 weeks early, as a premie, she was super small and could not latch. My milk did not come in, and I had little to no breastfeeding support at the hospital. I was told baby is hungry so formula feed. Ofcourse I complied, fed is best. But the guilt is eating me alive. I rented a hospital grade pump when I was discharged. I was able to give my baby liquid gold by pumping. But never was able to get me than 0.5-1oz in the beginning. Baby never latched, and I tried so hard. I was being pressured by the first pediatrician to keep trying. And I was told “what are you doing, you’re not trying harder” by the doctor. I was blamed for baby having jaundice by the doctor and I was told that formula won’t help the jaundice. Baby got so yellow and jaundiced I remember crying and hyperventilating. It was my fault. I spent every 3 hours for months pumping, just for my period to come and my supply to decrease to droplets. My mental health declined so much. The guilt of me formula feeding is eating me alive. The depression because formula is expensive and most of my dollars go to it is also eating me alive. The loneliness and depression of being told I should be losing more weight. 
I want to be the best version of myself for my baby. But I somehow cant. And baby is nearing 1 now, soon I will try for another. But how tf do I deal with the guilt of breastfeeding the 2nd baby and not the first. Almost makes me want to not try. 
I’m a shell of myself now. I brought a baby onto this earth, and I’m not giving them my best. I’m only giving them the bare minimum. How fcking pathetic am I?  ",
"TW past SI

I’m really having trouble being alone in my house with my baby (5 weeks). I work full time in healthcare, a job I find rewarding and keeps me suitably busy/challenged, but I’m on maternity leave until the beginning of June. I have a history of severe PPD with SI with my first baby. It’s not as bad this time, but I don’t know if this part (the dread and panic when my husband and toddler leave for work/daycare, the intense boredom paired with but simultaneous lack of motivation when I do identify projects around the house I could tackle (plus the difficulty doing them with a newborn)) is even part of it. I don’t want to ask to up my meds or add something new if I’m really just crying and judging myself for feeling this way. What if I eliminate the depressive symptoms and I still can’t just relax. I don’t remember what I used to do with my free time before kids. I used to wonder last time if it wasn’t PPD but just laziness or lack of fortitude. I’m my worst critic, lots of self judgement, which there is more opportunity for now when I’m not working. 

Yesterday I talked to my mom about going over to her house during the day, just to be with people and noise. I even reached out to my boss to do some unpaid tasks for her (she does a lot of presentations and research articles and often asks me to proofread). My first was born in nicer weather and we were better able to get out of the house and walk. Right now we have snow and freezing temps. I don’t have mom friends or friends who aren’t in the workforce that I could meet up with for coffee or lunch  

All of these things don’t feel like solutions, they feel like distractions from dealing with whatever the real problem is. I am going to discuss this more in therapy, it just feels like a heavy lift. Hoping someone can affirm that this was part of their experience, maybe give assurance that this gets better as you got better. If not, just ranting. ",
"Just need somewhere to put my thoughts and feelings.

Not really after advice, just a sense of not being alone.

Context is being at home (F) with a 2 month old on a particularly hard day and your partner is at impromptu drinks.

______________________

Loving you doesn't take away loving me; but it hasn't left much space for me.

My sense of who i am is lost; somewhere between my body being a factory and my mind wrapped around a schedule to help you thrive.

I lost my frivolity somewhere between the delicate wake windows and the painful let downs.

My adventurous energy lost somewhere between being your life source and being your entertainment.

I don't know my body. 
I don't know my desires.
I don't know this brain chemical balance. 
I don't know this new pain.
I don't know this new anxiety.
I don't know this schedule.

It's hard not to feel jealous of those who can go for late dinners without a thought of how you will go to sleep and how you will need me.

It's hard not to feel resentment of the 3rd and 4th and 5th drink of someone who isn't thinking of how they will feed you later. Maybe use the freezer milk? What if it's not defrosted in time? What if my supply dries up and that's all we have left? What if you don't sleep after the bottle because it's not your routine? What if i sleep through you cries? 

Must be nice to have that 3rd drink; or 4th or 5th. Bet you aren't even thinking about what is going on at home.

Must be nice to stay out for dinner because you felt like it. While I skip dinner.

Must be nice to only have one schedule to worry about.

Must be nice to know your body.

Must be nice to do something as 1 person, and not 1 and a pram, or 1.5, or 1 and a baby.

......must be nice.
.


But chin up.
Someone needs you.
Tomorrow is a new day.
And you don't have a choice anyway.



At least you are too little to see my tears; to feel my sadness; to read my notes.

I love you more than you will ever know little one, but I have lost the love for myself to make room for you.

"Ok, so, up until now I was doing great. I mean I would get emotional here and there but I felt like I was doing really good. However, this last week I just feel like I'm lost. I'm 4 months post partum and the last few nights I've been dealing with trouble sleeping and I go from eating a lot to nothing at all. I don't really know what's wrong. Does anyone have any advice? ",
"I’ve been fearing that I’m a terrible mother in the four months since I had my daughter. I’ve spent these months working on myself to the best of my ability. I’ve been going to postpartum groups, speaking to peer counselors, worked with a postpartum doula, and this is all in addition to my regular therapist and medication. We have done a lot of work on helping me reframe my feelings about being a terrible mother; I have felt this way because of feeling no connection with my child, feeling total apathy, wishing I never became a mom, sad all the time, too mentally exhausted to care for her.  All normal signs of PPD, which I have come to learn.

But this brought me backward several steps in the process. I had a migraine on Sunday and my spouse was working the entire day so I asked a friend if she was available to help
Me, which got out to my MIL, which lead her to say I’m a terrible mother who doesn’t love my child. It’s not true at all that I don’t love my child and I am heartbroken and believe maybe I am a terrible mother for getting so much help 

Update- she apologized, but I need some time. I’m haunted by these words and it’s going to take a bit for the wounds to heal ",
"I got married in December of 2024... and had my baby in January- exactly a month apart. Whenever I say I'm tired or I cry; my husband says, ""you're not tired"". It's so hard living with somebody who doesn't see how draining post partum truly is. I'm exhausted. I barely have time to feed myself. I just found out my baby is underweight for his age... and I am filled with regret for being married. My husband and I have been fighting a lot. I'm often quite violent when he makes me upset and he's very unkind with his words-- calling me retarted, etc. he's said some really hurtful things like recently he told me that he thought this girl at church was really beautiful and she had a nice ass. It broke my heart and now I can't stop looking at her at church. He also told me recently that he had a dream of this girl he went to highschool with and they were having sex. He apologized for both those things he said but it broke my heart again. After he says those things, im not going to lie, I do say hurtful things back like telling him to divorce me or that I hate him but im very hurt and I can't help but hurt him back.

I want to get divorced at this point. I'm wondering when I'll start feeling better and more in control",
"Has anyone ever taken Zuranolone?? It’s a new medication FDA approved to TREAT postpartum depression. 
Pros vs cons?? Downfalls? How was coming off of the medication?? ",
Sometimes it doesn’t even feel like he’s my baby? Did anyone else feel this way?,
"I’m on day two of medication (Wellbutrin 150 XL) and I wanted to share what I have recently been going through because it turns out that a lot of this **more common** than I thought previously. 

I reviewed it with my doctor as well and it was obvious that I have depression however it went from 0-100 in the span of a few days (I thought I was going insane, thank you hormonal fluctuations) I started noticing these symptoms around the end of month three of postpartum, they got REALLY bad at the end of month 5 (which is right now.) 

My friends are going through it as well and it’s probably better for us to speak out about it than to hide it. Who knows who else this might help...

Weird Postpartum Depression and Anxiety symptoms I have experienced:

* You have a hard time focusing on anything around you, you sort of have this tunnel vision
* It’s hard to look at someone in their eyes
* You go to sleep wired and wake up tired
* You seek comfort foods not because you are hungry but because you can’t think of another way to feel better (for me that is mini m&ms because of the texture)
* Same with online shopping, you do it to feel better because nothing else feels good
* Taking care of your baby feels like a chore, you want to just go to sleep and you don’t enjoy taking care of them
* You daydream about going to bed
* Listening to people and understanding what they are saying is hard
* You get irritated and mad at silly things like Instagram posts
* You think everyone is against you or doesn’t like you
* You hear negative voices in your head instead of music (this was an important one for me)
* Complete loss of appetite, no foods sounds appealing or even taste good. You barely feel hunger
* You don’t want to brush your teeth or hair
* You don’t care about your appearance
* You go through your day in a sort of haze or heavy cloud
* Everything feels heavy, your feet, anything you pick up feels heavy
* Your sugars/glucose levels are constantly low
* You continue to only watch things that make you feel good or a certain kind of way (for me that is Disney vloggers)
* Time passes much faster when you are depressed, you feel like you are quickly sleeping through it
* You have night rage, this intense feeling to break something (tv, mirror, thoughts of hurting yourself because you can’t handle all of the emotions)
* You really stick to a tight schedule and stick to it so that nothing can interfere with your only way of staying safe and in check. Safety mechanism\*
* You always feel less than capable and on edge
* Family members stress you out by being physically too close to you, hugs are hard, any sort of connections are difficult
* You have this deep inner need to feel better and fix yourself but you don’t know what’s wrong but something feels wrong
* You can’t find the motivation to start anything
* You forget things easily

I really hope your symptoms are not as bad as mine are. Let me know if you have any of these and if meds were able to help you out. I'd love any sort of insight or support cause this is tough. Tougher than I could've ever imagined. Blah. ",
"I just need to vent. 
I’m 11 weeks postpartum, and love my little boy more than life itself! I am of course struggling with PPD, and it’s even harder because no one checks up on me. I’m so glad everyone loves my son so much, but I wish others still cared about me. No one asks how I’m doing or has really checked up on me in the 11 weeks since I’ve given birth. My own mom has told me she loves my son more than me. That did hurt considering how low I truly feel. When I post pictures of me and my son together (I have only posted two, as truly there is probably 1/8th of the amount of photos of us together compared to him and his dad together that I have taken) everyone completely ignores me and only says anything about him. I know he is the main star which is wonderful! I just wish someone would tell me i look pretty since I’ve felt so awful about my physical appearance since birth, and just really struggling. My partner never asks how I’m feeling or if I need a break. He gets to basically do anything he wants and talks on the phone to his friends for sometimes hours while I take care of our son, and he takes care of him for 6-8 hours at night since he is out of work at the moment. I just don’t feel like my old self at all anymore, and I genuinely feel like my depression is getting worse.",
My PPD and PPA have been making it really difficult to eat lately. I just don't have the appetite. I'm worried how this will affect my milk supply. Has anybody encountered this? I also feel like I'm starting to annoy my husband with my issues. I just want to cry. ,
"For context I had severe PPD/PPA and pp psychosis with my last baby almost three years ago. I was put on medication and had finally evened out emotionally. I have my meds and have already met with my psychiatrist and was given to go ahead to start taking the “safe” ones (I’m breastfeeding). I don’t want too because I don’t want my baby to have any of the medications in his system. But I feel like I’m slipping. I might just be having an off day but I’m so emotional. I feel like wanting to cry constantly, but I also feel numb at the same time. I’m struggling. My baby was in the nicu for a week and I haven’t processed all of the trauma that came from that. He wasn’t breathing when he was born and I had a c section that ran a total of 3 hours so I never got to see him during that time and didn’t see him until later that night. Idk if I want advice or if I’m just ranting. Thanks for listening ",
"Zurzuvae 
Day 1: I took the medication with high fat meal& went to sleep like 3 hours later. I didn't feel too drowsy but when I woke up in the night to tend to baby, I couldn't even handle it. I stumbled to the bathroom before I fed her, as I usually do, but felt drunk AF. I came back to bed and tried to lift my baby but couldn't even manage! I had to wake up my husband to ask him to change her diaper and he said I sounded drunk. My baby slept more than she ever slept at night before. 
12 hours go by, so I should be able to drive a car at this time but nah, I still felt fucked up I went back to sleep& we slept till 1pm. I felt pretty good throughout the day. No depression or anxiety. I felt able to deal with situations calmly but physically, my body hurt! My back, my bones, and my joints ached all day even after Tylenol.
I'm not sure I even want to take it tonight but I'm going to. 
Day 2: only a little unsteady at night but not well enough to care for baby. Felt a little better during the day, less anxiety
Day 3: I really felt it at night, similar to the first night but not as much. The day I felt way better. Actually, did some housework and didn't hate life as much.
4: during the night, I was pretty fucked up. My baby was fussy and I couldn't care for her. My husband had a rough night but I feel pretty good today. I actually feel happy. I'm playing with my baby& cleaning. Very tired though and annoyed.
5: during the night, I didn't remember much. My husband handled everything, as usual. He even helps me getting her to latch during feeds. During the day, I felt low. As the day turned to night, it got even worse. I cried and I'm not sure why. I guess just because I'm sad that my daughter has a depressed mom that needs medication
6: I don't remember last night at all but didn't go to sleep until about 4am, took drug at 8pm as usual but stayed up watching movies with my husband. I hate to admit this but I use THC to help me feel better but then that's what makes me sad too because I know cannabis is transmitted in breast milk but I feel so low sometimes even with this medication.I hope by the end of this course I'll feel better because pp is really difficult.
7: I feel good today. A week in, only a week left of this torturous medication. I have little rashes in different places all over my arms. My memory of the night before is non-existent. I took the medication around my regular time & went to sleep about 4 hours later. I only feel the effects a little until I fall asleep and wake up, then I'm fucked up. My baby was good last night, I think. Okay it's the afternoon now& I cried a lot.

I think I forgot to take the med last night. My memory is pretty fucked up but I woke up this morning crying also. I had thoughts of not wanting my daughter and how I hate who I am. I had thoughts of understanding how women can leave their family behind and start a new life. 

8: during the night, I felt the med fs. As if I was drunk. Feel great this morning. I love my baby so much and I'm happy. I feel kind of guilty though for the strain I put on my partner. I'm letting him sleep now. He's 26& I'm 32. He's so good to me�& our baby. I'm blessed. I'm bleeding still though so that kind of worries me since I'll be 6 weeks pp tomorrow. The bleeding stopped 4 weeks then we had sex and a couple days later more bleeding. Pretty sure it's no concern though. This skin rash has become bothersome though�
9: during the night, it was all good but I was very emotional. That might be because some memories though. I used to never cry but pregnancy/pp got me crying all the time. I love my baby so much though& my life is amazing so I really should be happy but thess damn hormones got me all fucked up. I really hope this medication works. These side effects are intense af. I feel dizzy throughout the day. I noticed time seems to go by faster when I'm on the drug, like during the nights when I feed her. I look at the bf timer & way more time has gone by then what I thought. I hate having to do things but not as much as before.
10: during the night, side effects weren't as intense. I feel pretty good this morning. I find myself laughing at things that used to irritate me. 
11: during the night, I don't remember much so I think it went smoothly. It's just hard to bf cuz I can't even pick up my baby but I just do the side lying position so it's all good. I've researched bfing while on this medication& I know it's less than 1%.i read somewhere it's 0.357% that transmits. I know I cannabis stays in breast milk for like 6 days but my baby deserves a happy mom. I really try to limit my intake& this medication almost over. I'm so happy to be almost done with it. The no sex thing sucks cuz I'm not tryna have a baby with birth defects, that's just mean. At this point, I already feel like this medication is worth all the horrible side effects.
12: during the night, it was a rough night, not due to the medication though. My baby had a blow out then threw up while I was feeding her. We had to change the sheets and I had to shower. I was only a little unstable. Idk if it's because I didn't have enough fat for the medication to absorb to  or I'm just getting used to the med. Still was dizzy though. I didn't carry the baby at all tho. I do feel like the medication is working. 
13: last night went pretty well. I did feel the medication so I really worry that some nights I have not had enough fat in my dinner. Only minimal thoughts of how my life would be better without my child. 
14: during the night, there were no issues. 

Conclusion 
I suppose this drug is worth it if you really don't feel well. I'm not crying all the time. Just be aware the side effects may be intense. I do feel less worried. Before I was stressing about literally everything, now not so much. I do feel more like myself and I'm barely 2 months pp. I'm sure medication sped up the pp process because I've read it can take months to years in some cases.
The side effects were so intense but it's only for 14 days& then you may feel like yourself again. I'm glad I took the chance on this medication. I was the first one my ob prescribed it to. I can actually smile, baby talk, & I'm happy to take care of my baby when she needs me. Please ask any questions you may have���",
"Doing so helped my mental state to be better and more stable in my own time, having the app sending me notifications of nap time-sweet spot-bedtime made me anxious! 

Tracking my baby’s feeds and making sure he’s within the “supposedly intake amount “ made me worry if he’s over fed or under fed. 

I now go with the flow… i am enjoying this phase it feels amazing personally to just go with what he feels like and noticing his cues either hunger or sleeping. 

I only log his weight weekly on notes app to make sure all is good and wet diapers sometimes here and there. 

Little achievement in all of that regarding for my PPD",
You know what the hardest part of having a colicky baby while going through PPD? It’s that you can’t even cry or get a hug from your significant other because if you cry you’re just adding to the situation and your sig. other is probably holding the baby so you can’t even get a hug. So I just cry by myself. ,1
"I have struggled with my mental health (suicidal ideation, self-harm) since I got pregnant and while things seem to be improving with weekly therapy and prioritizing my sleep, I feel like I experience intense setbacks. Like last night, my 5 month old is going through a sleep regression and every time she woke up (every 30-40 mins), I couldn’t get rid of the feeling of wanting to end it all. We’re on vacation and I can keep myself together during the day, caffeinate and persevere but by the end of the day I’m so exhausted that when she doesn’t stay asleep, I can’t think of anything better than going to sleep forever and never waking up. I got about 6 hours of sleep after she finally went to sleep and I feel better now, but it’s still the morning. I’m scared of what the night will bring. Thankfully I have my husband who took the baby when I verbalized my thoughts to him.

I guess what I’m saying is I find it hard to believe that there are women who don’t experience PPD with such a lack of sleep but maybe I’m the crazy one. ",2
"I was in the midst of working through the worst part of my marriage when k found out I was pregnant last year with our third. Our second was around 9 months at that time and I had just discovered (another) moment of (another) affair my husband was engaging in about three months prior. I was actually speaking to divorce attorneys and everything. 

The gist: my husband was a shitty partner that pays bills and does nothing more than that whether it was household or child rearing that wasn’t performative, wanted kids and then the “weight of the kids and the responsibilities there in made him try to seek validation and attention from women that didn’t ‘need’ so much from him”

He cheated after our first child was born (never physically but who cares) and we had her during covid while living with his family so my PPD was so severe it took three years to get off of it. So finding out after our second that he was doing the same thing less than 6mos PP was infuriating and heartbreaking. I didn’t wanna have another child by this person and in us trying to fix our relationship one last time I got pregnant again (no excuses here).

I didn’t want to be pregnant again, I didn’t want anyone else to take care of. I already don’t have a life outside of my kids because I can’t trust anyone else to just take care of them. I partially tried to avoid divorce because I don’t trust my husband to know how to take care of them.

Pregnancy was fine. Our relationship is getting better and I don’t think he feels the need to cheat anymore (�). We have been in a better place the past 9 months for the most part. Now I’m a month PP and my PPD is kicking my ass-hard. Intrusive thoughts of self harm are louder this time, I love my kids and they’re literally the only reason I’m here but I feel so damn trapped. I used to love bedtime now I fear it because I don’t know which kid will keep me up all night screaming. I never get rest. I sleep maybe 4 hours Max and that’s being generous. I feel like me being so distracted with the kids (I put them all to bed sometimes staying in the nursery to be able to get some rest. (18mo is in the middle of a sleep regression) but I’m starting to feel like I’m giving him room to start doing the same things. My MIL has been the most entitled person I’ve ever encountered since I’ve been pregnant so they provide zero support but expect access to my kids. It’s all just making the fact that I have a kid I don’t plan, but had because I felt like he deserved to be here more stressful and disappointing. 

I’ve considered telling my doctor about this solely for the possibility of being admitted-THATS how tired I am. Then I go back to these kids that I adore that didn’t ask to be here and I know as a mom I have more in me to give so I just keep going. 

Really I’m just tired. And so damn sad. And disappointed. Either way I’m ecstatic to go get back on my meds- this feels HORRIBLE.

"To preface, im not judging anyone who cosleeps. I personally do not want to because i have an anxiety disorder and it causes distress for me and I also have to take a bite of seroquel to help me sleep. (I need this medication due to suffering from post partum psychosis) so sometimes it's hard for me to wake up.

I'm a ftm to a 4 month old and she currently sleeps in a bassinet beside my side of the bed. At around 2 months she was hospitalized with RSV and in the picu for 4 days. Ever since then she would  (like a couple times a week)  wake up for her 4 am bottle, and that's all I remember. I wake up to her sleeping on my stomach or in the nook of my arm between me and the pregnancy pillow I sleep with still. This stopped for a bit and fast forward to this last week ive been waking up with her in my arms or on my stomach with no recollection of how she gets there. Its been happening every night and ive been distraught thinking im going to kill my baby. Ive tried moving the bassinet a foot away from the bed  and ive thought about maybe putting the bassinet at the foot of the bed or maybe on my husband's side? Ive thought about even putting a bell on my hand. ",0

"I need advice. Idk if I’m TA. *Backstory* Me and my fiancé had our 2nd baby in September 2024. We already have a two year old who is very much in the terrible twos. Ever since i had my second baby my patience has been so thin. I have constant headaches which doesn’t help the patience. My fiancés patience is even worse than mine. He has terrible anger issues, but he recently started a new hobby that has helped immensely with his anger. I have been very supportive of his hobby, I’m happy to see him so happy, focussed and just really enjoying himself, he even found some friends which i think is great. But he has been so consumed with his hobby lately that he has been really slacking on helping with the kids and just being present with me in general. Ive been struggling with dealing with the kids lately, and stressing about planning our wedding, which is happening this August. Ive felt even more alone since he started this hobby and got his new friends. My depression has been getting worse as well. I don’t want him to stop his hobby but i feel he needs to learn to balance family, work and this hobby better. I need a break to be honest. I don’t know how to bring up this issue because anytime i bring up an issue he takes it from 0-100 and really beats himself up over it and usually if i bring up an issue about something he’s doing he usually responds with “ill just stop then” and i hate it and i dont want him to stop the hobby because he seems so much happier and his anger outbursts have been pretty much nonexistent since.",2
I have been feeling as if I am struggling extremely bad with postpartum depression. It is hard for me to gauge as I have always dealt with extreme depression and mood swings but it just feels as it has kicked up these last few weeks since I have had her. I am feeling very guilty and scared to ask for help. I haven’t been eating to the point I’m waking up in the night with the most extreme muscle cramps and dehydration so bad I’m downing water in the night like it’s nothing. I genuinely don’t remember the last time I ate a meal and it’s not because I don’t have the chance she is an amazing baby only wakes up about twice in the night and won’t even cry when she has a dirty diaper. She is three weeks old and is every thing I could’ve ever wished for I have always wanted a baby and had a hard few years trying to conceive which only makes me feel more guilty as I feel I should be over the moon to have her here which I am but I do have the worst moments of sadness. It happens mostly at night and feels like “Sunday scaries” as they say just worse. I feel the most intense guilt everytime I wake up like i haven’t done enough with her or for her. I have had a few thoughts of just ending it but I am so scared to say because I am terrified they will take her away if I say that. I have support but for some reason I don’t want anyone else to watch her I’m so scared to be away from her and I get the worst anxiety if I am. I am so scared if I bring this up to my on they will take her away or judge me. Is this normal with postpartum depression? I know that mom’s feel guilty about it but is it to the point they are having panic attacks about their baby being taken away because of it? I am just so scared to bring it up because I am terrified of being judged and having her taken because I am so sad. I know that it will be better for her to have a happier mom I just want to know if what I am feeling is normal with postpartum depression. I have heard so much about it and I thought I would never feel guilty about bringing it up if I had it but I cannot bring myself to say something due to the fact I am terrified that they will take her away knowing I am this depressed. ,1
"Hello, I am seriously struggling.. I am a stay at home mom of 2. I have stayed at home for 2 years now. Before having kids I worked all the time and enjoyed it. I am blessed I get to stay home, but I have struggled since day one. My ppd was bad with my first and with my second.. my second baby is 3 months old. I sometimes feel like I have no connection with him.. . I feel like I am a bad mom and can't entertain my 18 month old.. and are constantly just watching TV.. I feel so anxious to go out and do things with both of them if my husband isn't around... My 18th month old is constantly throwing fits. My husband recently went back to work and it has been so hard after having him home for 8 weeks paternity leave. I just have no motivation to do anything.. I just want o ball my eyes out. Finding mom friends is so hard...  Just venting here... Anyone else struggling or feeling the same way .. ",0
"Hi, 

A very dear friend of mine recently went through a traumatic birth. We live far away so I’m unable to see her anytime soon but wanted to send a care basket. 

I’m good on items for the baby, but what specifically are items or things that she would appreciate that could help her feel a little better? 

I don’t have children so I’m not sure what things would be useful. TIA! ",0
"me and my partner are both 20 with an 8 month old baby, he’s been telling me that he doesn’t feel in love with me, because we are not able to do the things we used to when we didn’t have a baby. now he’s telling me that he’s just trying to love me, he always made it seemed that it’s my fault, he doesn’t really make an effort visiting us (we live separately with our parents since our parents are the ones still supporting our baby) they told us that we should finish college first before living together. i’ve been struggling with ppd for months and his statements made it more harder for me. i tried opening up what i felt to what he said, but he only dismissed what i feel.

My wife struggles so much with accountability and playing victimhood because she can’t handle criticism or even the slightest amount of negative feedback. I went to the psych ward twice this year. From stress involving her and trying my best to hold it all together as she acts out in so many ways and doesn’t see her own toxic behavior. I am literally at the point I want nothing to do with her or our kid. She has made a lot of bold independent choices and each time I say anything that is in disagreement with her… victimization is happening .. it happens so fast she can’t process it and I’m at rock bottom on so many levels. I myself suffer from bpd…cptsd and I am very aware of my own symptoms but shit …….at least I’m able to listen and try my best to understand but I refuse to be a punching bad and everything isn’t always my fault…. There’s two sides to the story but man.. I can’t do it .. I’m done..I don’t want to argue just so I can have to always be the bad guy even when she makes these mistakes because of lack of communication and just isn’t able to grasp reality even after being in therapy. Sorry but yeah … my regrets are large and big so is my understanding of if I had to make this work. I would be having to be the blame person nahhh I got childhood trauma from that with my mom… I’m not dealing with that because I heard ppd can last for years ,1
"Not exactly sure what I'm looking for here, maybe just to vent. I feel like everybody is so kind and checking in when you are pregnant and saying to ""just reach out"" if you need anything, but then it's just crickets.
I had an extremely traumatic pregnancy- nothing to do with me but there were major concerns with my baby, who thankfully is home and healthy. Then we unexpectedly lost our home and had to move at 9 months pregnant, and are temporarily staying with family while our new home is being put together. Once I had my baby, I did have all the feelings and the bond is definitely there, but at 5 months postpartum I still feel like I got hit with a Mack truck. The sleep deprivation was expected but I think I was way under prepared for just feeling so unable to do literally anything. And the loneliness! 
After coming home from the hospital everyone wanted to visit the baby, and did come at first (usually during nap time, then overstaying, leaving me with a sink full of dishes and an overstimulated baby and no opportunity to nap or pump.) But it seems as though since the newness has worn off nobody has the time of day for me. One friend periodically texts to check in. But honestly all I want is company. All I look forward to every week is Monday when my Mom comes for about 45 minutes to take a walk, and usually just ends up commenting on my weight or asking about how I'm trying to get the baby weight off, which I literally do not care about. But even then sometimes she forgets to call or gets busy so I can't always depend on that walk. I am too scared to walk by myself with the baby because I get paranoid of predators everywhere. I do try to reach out and ask people to go for a walk with me but they don't respond most of the time, and the last time one friend ended up saying she could go if I could just watch her toddler for a couple of hours, but she ended up coming back late and didn't have the time for the walk after all. I don't mean to complain about babysitting for her because I love her daughter and she doesn't have a lot of childcare options- I just feel like it's a big ask when I am still coming out of the postpartum period. 
I sent out a somewhat desperate group text asking for company but mostly got radio silence. I feel like everyone who offered help when I was pregnant was just doing lip service. I wish I had decided to splurge on a postpartum doula and am wondering if it's too late now. 
Also I have very bad postpartum OCD and the family members I live with really do not respect my boundaries as far as kissing the baby and germs. They consistently belittle me and tell me I'm paranoid and that ""he can't get sick anyway because I breastfeed him."" He got sick at 3 months when a family member kissed him on the head not 30 seconds after I said it made me uncomfortable. The baby getting sick was awful not only because it's just generally awful and scary when your newborn gets sick but also due to the circumstances and we had just finally started to feel like we were getting a routine. I have still not been able to get that feeling back. 
I've tried looking for a post partum support group or just moms groups to fill the week with but there's almost nothing available. I've done a couple of meetups with  other church moms but feel very out of place. I just don't know where this supposed village is? I do try to ask but nobody responds. The one time I tried to honestly say I was struggling to a friend they just offered to call an ambulance. Which was definitely unnecessary and scared me. I love my baby and have nothing but loving feelings towards my baby. I would honestly love a bit of sleep, but more than anything I just feel lonely and wish someone could just give me the time of day to walk with me. I don't know why everyone talks about this ""support system"" and just ""reach out"" when they don't seem to really mean it. Sorry for the long rant. Just needed it out of my system I suppose.",0
"I live with my in-laws, being his parents and his big sister, to add on, my husband is in the marines so he isn’t around much. I don’t live with my parents because they have no room for us and the environment is not ideal to raise a child. Having an apartment is not an option because We are investing in other things ATM. We just had our first baby and I find myself in a situation whereby my MIL babies my husband’s sister and treats her as a priority. Eg. If my baby is crying and my SIL needs to talk, she would let my baby cry and deal with her daughter.
My MIL does everything for me, washes my clothes, cooks and everything. I mainly take care of the baby unless I’m eating or showering. I try to handle the laundry and doing small house chores when my MIL has the baby.
The rational part of me says that my baby is my priority so therefore her daughter is most likely her priority.
The irrational part of me is like WTH! The woman is almost 40 she can take care of herself.

"Am 4 months postpartum. I had traumatic postpartum experience. Im in long distance with my husband from 10 months ..During my delivery I had severe swelling in both my legs, for that doctor gave lasix injection.. after taking that injection  I went silent for few seconds and I felt dizziness..followed that I behaved abnormal and talked irrelevant (like I behaved like a crazy person)..after discharge I had panic attacks and recently  am feeling better...but 10 days back I had intense fight with my husband over call and suddenly my brain felt like shock and I remained silent for few minutes and cut the call ..that night passed with fear..and next day I suddenly felt like going crazy and cried in front of my mother ..and every day im feeling intense fear like as if i might go crazy..actually my father died due to bipolar when im 6 years old...maybe all these things are triggering my depression...but I'm constantly being in fear of doing crazy things and having  intrusive thoughts ..i even went to psychiatrist and currently taking nexito 10mg ..but that is not helping me in any way ...please help!!",0
I find myself very irritable when my LO is extra fussy or wakes up a lot during the night. I’m trying to figure out if I have ppd and it could just be showing up as a lack of patience and irritability instead of crying/sadness.,0
"So my postpartum journey has been kind of a mess. I started early on with PPD/PPA which led me to be terrified to care for my child. With medication and therapy I am definitely better than where I was. My parents and my husband's dad and stepmom have been extremely helpful and came to watch the baby with me when I was at my lowest and taken the baby to their houses when we needed breaks. Right now my husband and I have the flu from hell, and my parents took the baby to their house for her protection and for our recovery. His dad is going to get her then for the second half of the week and weekend until we recover. I just feel bad and I hope my baby doesn't feel unwanted or something? She's only 3 months old and I'm glad she can have this early bond and love with her grandparents but I just feel like a bad mom that they have her so much. ",1
"I had only just realised I had postpartum depression all along. And my partner left me a month ago. He just said he doesn’t want to be with me and thinks he fell out of love. For context, he is also battling depression and was on antidepressants when he said it. 

I became extremely vulnerable since the birth of my son. Everything my partner would say to me felt like an accusation of some kind. I was overwhelmed and overreacting to everything. I even had anxiety about going outside. I still do, but it’s getting better. I kept thinking so low about myself. Even wanted to be gone. 

Now after what he did, I understand that I should’ve dealt with it before this happened. It just hurts now and I’m so disappointed in myself. I think I might have caused him depression. 

Is there any chance I could fix things, do you think?

"I am so emotionally drained, physically tired, lonely and my heart is hurting. I go out and see other mums married or with someone and I can't do this. I wasn't going to be a single mother for the daughter I thought I wanted.
I look at her and wish I could strangle her so I could be free. I look at her and wish I could give up my parental rights because I hate my loss of freedom, time, money, her father is sometimes present and I wish he could raise her. He so desperately 'wanted a baby' but he's in another state pretending to care but I would rather her be with him. I'm so over her and her need for food, I don't have the energy. I have some support with my family but I'd rather not have her. My hopes and dreams were stolen by her goddamn father who refused to be a family with me.
I'm so angry with him, I'm so angry at her, I'm so angry at me for being so gullible. I don't want this child, I want to be a mother, but I hate her, I don't want her. She ruined my life and maybe this is ppd but I don't see her in a maternal instinctual way, I don't see her the way I'm 'supposed' to.

"Hi guys, I hope you don't me posting in here to ask you these questions! 

I'm 39, just found out I am pregnant and going through the normal waves of excitement and sheer panic. It has been a total shock as I assumed I couldn't have children and I think I had made peace with that. 

I've been thinking about postpartum depression and trying to understand it more. Those of you with PPD, were you excited during your pregnancy? Was this the thing that you always wanted? How do you feel at the moment? Would love to hear your views to help me better understand this! 

Appreciate you all x",0
"I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this…

I have mostly enjoyable days, but I keep getting hit with this thought: What’s the point? Like, what’s the point of buying a house, making plans, or doing anything when it all ends anyway? It’s not constant, but when it comes, it knocks me hard and takes me away from my beautiful life and family.

I also find myself fearing the thought returning, so I end up ruminating on it even more.

I’m about 7 months postpartum—has anyone else felt this way? Is this normal?",2
"wanted to start of by saying I am a (23F). I recently turned 23 a couple days ago. I have 2 babies, 3 weeks old and 2 1/2 years old. I love my husband and my kids very much but I have struggled since I was young with anxiety and depression. I had an extremely traumatic childhood. watching things happen between my parents, my mother getting extremely ill with stage 4 cancer and struggling being a single parent, then ultimately fighting her battle with alcohol addiction being horrible and angry and violent. then through my teenage years as well, I had a stepfather who wanted to become romantically involved with me and a verbally abusive boyfriend….you name it. I really have been through the wringer. after my first child I found out about my husband’s porn addiction. really messed with me. but my husband has been true to his promise and not continued and is very loving to me. 

unfortunately I can’t forgive him for sending me into PPD. Then this year, I got diagnosed with OCD. a lot of other stuff occurred throughout our relationship that I kinda have felt off about but he is a good dad and husband. having my second child was hard. I found out that this pregnancy was high risk and because of this, I had to fly for medical care and the birth. I go to school full time as well. 

Finally after having my second child, I felt rage and extreme grief. Depression and anxiety like over never felt in my life.
I started dissociating and it felt like someone was strapping me to a chair in my brain and making me relive and watch all the most traumatic things that ever happened to me and I can’t scream or get out of the chair. I just made the decision that I cannot keep feeling this way and I need help. I have never felt as completely weak and unable to move like that before. I feel so bad that my kids are not gonna have a normal mom, just a broken one. I hate that I need medication and can’t have a normal brain. Just needed to vent

"I was here before after my first baby. We had a rough time with her due to medical stuff/traumatic birth/nicu/surgery

Ended up with ppd and ptsd which I was still struggling with when I ended up pregnant with my second. 

My first is now almost 22months and I'm 2.5wks pp with my second baby. 

Pregnancy was awful. I came off my meds in the first trimester as they weren't really doing much for me anyway and been off medication since. I had poor standard of maternity and mental health care which left me not even wanting to be pregnant anymore. (Something the teams were aware of.)

I couldn't get perinatal specific mental health as they don't bother travelling to my area and I can't travel 200 miles every time for an appointment. Phone/video doesn't work for me as I tried it after my first and there was just no benefit. I need in person support and I wasn't getting it. 

I was self harming a lot, including direct harm to my stomach, had periods of starving myself, and even attempted an overdose at 32wks because I just couldn't do it anymore. 

I finally got mental health help again after the overdose attempt. I'd been left since September with no help and the attempt was January. 

Things were better this time birth/immediate  postpartum. I got the delivery I wanted, no nicu and I have a healthy baby. 

For the last week it's started getting bad again. I cry a lot. I'm feeling suicidal. I want to self harm. 

I'm struggling so much with my first right now and just can't seem to cope with her at all. I get angry at her and have thoughts of hurting her like when I had ppd before. It's all still centred around her, even though I was able to have a positive experience with baby 2. 

When he turned a week old I could barely stop crying because when my first was a week old she was taken for emergency surgery. It's all still reminders of what we went through the first time which is making me feel maybe it's more the ptsd than ppd 

I'm yet to see any mental health professionals and even when I saw our health visitor I wasn't honest about how I'm feeling and I don't  really know why. 

I know I need help again and I'm hoping I'll get a call from the mental health team on Monday to sort support again. I won't phone myself even though I know I need it and I really don't understand why I'm like that... 

Think it's just how much I've been let down by them during my pregnancy. Feels like unless it's them reaching out they're not actually going to do anything ",0

"It’s been nearly 4 months after birth of second child. My wife and I had so much support and love after my daughter and despite of the challenges we did it together. #2 has been a very different story. Her family has been much less supportive, making more comments that upset her and less sensitive to my wife. Her rock (sister) is getting married and the wedding stress and I think realization that her sister is going to be less available and geographically separated permanently is sinking in. This along with much more stressful jobs (for both of us) and a toddler running around along with daycare issues feels overwhelming. It’s a lot, I’m generally an optimist and love my wife. Her view on life has become extremely negative. We’ve always engaged each other in conflict (neither of us is at all passive aggressive) I think our very similar in the moment upset personalities does not help our situation. It feels like she wants to create conflict through an intentional tone and word choice of instigation. I admittedly end up taking the bait. These conflicts always seem to erupt before we needs to do things - dinners, meet friends, dates etc and cause her to try and cancel. She knows she’s not herself and even said she would clearly hit all the flags for PPD but refuses therapy or treatment. Everything I try to do is “wrong” these days and it’s frustrating because even when I do 95% of things right she will erupt over the other 5%. Even when she recognizes later on that she was having a moment she refuses to ever apologize. She constantly tells me I can leave anytime, she’s given up, what’s the point.
I’ve never even mentioned leaving her ever in our relationship. I’m at a loss. I want to help her but I just don’t know what to do. I do try do be more aware, more sensitive, help more but I’m not perfect and at the end of the day sometimes I’m exhausted too from helping with baby and toddler and keeping up with all the household activities.",1
I just had a baby 3 weeks ago and I'm drowning my boyfriend has it all it seems he can do whatever he wants and watching him be happy while I'm miserable. It's hard and I know it's selfish but in a way a way I can't stand him I see as someone who is free and I feel trapped I've told him my emotions are getting worse and I see no damn urgency to maybe get some help. I know a part of me loves him very much because I do but there is this other side that wants him gone. I feel like everyday I'm finding reasons to be mad at him on purpose he's not taking it very seriously but it's serious to me I don't want to be like this. I feel the need to do things just to make him upset and i need this to stop I haven't gone out for myself since I've had her. I love her more than myself that maybe if I'm not here she will have a better life without me and all these new emotions. Idk what to do any advice would be nice.,0
"I had a baby. 

Then when he was 18 months i had another baby. I know a bog part of my depression is i am lonely. No mother no father and i don’t complain to my friends because they have the same issues BUT every time they cry to me the next day their parents are there and i love that for them. I just dont have that.  So for about a year now ive been pouring from a empty glass. Husband is Army so barley ever home if he is i dont wanna bother him. With my non issue issues. And i dont wanna interrupt his time to decompress while he’s watching TV or playing a video game. I am pitch perfect on the Internet, loving, caring, very interactive husband as what I tell my friends. I never had a mother or father going up. (I was six years old and I potty trained myself when I realized I should not be in pull-ups. Those exact thoughts came into my mind.) just to put it into perspective. I am truly mothering off of instinct. I don’t know what a family looks like much less a good one, but I do know right from wrong. When my husband was deployed for the first two years of parenthood I thought I was doing really good. I didn’t realize my son didn’t know how to play with toys mostly because I didn’t know how to play with toys, but he learned so quickly by just seeing my husband and so did I. I didn’t realize I had to teach him things like throwing or kicking a ball. I didn’t realize I needed to teach the little things like grabbing a toothbrush by himself. Until my husband started making comments like you gotta let them do it you gotta do this. You gotta do that and I’ve never taken them to heart because those are just things. I never thought because those are things that I just taught myself even up to college. I learned that you should wash behind your ears and it’s just something that I never thought about. I know this is turning into kind of a trauma, but I just need understanding of where I’m coming from. Tonight my husband was trying to make my son say sorry for accidentally poking him in the eye.  He was screaming and crying, and I was ignoring to allow him to parent. But then he made the comment. “ I have to teach you everything like always.” I just feel like I jumped from the cliff. I’ve been standing on top for so long and I thought I was backing away and now the only thing I wanna do is jump. It feels like he stabbed me and I don’t think I will ever recover with how deep this feels. I just don’t want to give my kids any trauma that I had and I also don’t wanna hold them back from life just because I don’t know how to do things. What do i do? Books on what to teach kids like very specific?  How can i make sure i am teachinb them everything they need without asking someone in my life. Im tired of the crazy looks or pity eyes. But i truly just raised myself and i dont wanna hold my lods back just because im socially/mentally/emotionally stunted. And if you’re gonna suggest therapy, I’ve been in therapy since the day I turned 18. And I refuse to have kids until I was 25 because I wanted to make sure that I was capable. I just didnt anticipate all of this little things that I didn’t realize. I didn’t even know how to do myself. ",0
"My partner is the youngest of 5 boys and I just had a boy so you can guess where this is going. 
We both agreed that we wanted to wait a month before inviting family down to give us time to get a routine in place but his mom bombarded us by deciding to come 1 week pp and say she’s staying for 3 weeks. 

I’m 5 weeks pp now 

Granted she’s not staying here but she’s here everyday by 8 am and doesn’t leave until 5 or 6. 

Let me just say I’m appreciative of the help during the day but it’s very condescending help. 

I get -

I stopped right there because even in the midst of me typing this trying to get some space and a break from being around her now that my partner is home, she busts in my room badgering me like what’s wrong with you? Get up! and my partner is just standing there doing nothing like just letting this happen

Anyway, I get that we’re new, young parents but we are not idiots. I am not an idiot. I went and took a million parenting classes, I’ve done the research and I’ve been here with my child to know him. 

But to constantly walk on eggshells all day in my own home, having her judge what I eat to the point where i’m starving myself and counting down the minutes until she leaves so I can eat or standing in the kitchen eating at the counter so she can’t see, being told all day i’m not burping him right, holding him right, changing him to slow, he doesn’t have on enough clothes, he’s not eating enough, give him gripe water for his stomach like my goodness I can not deal. Everything is a critique and my pediatrician doesn’t know what’s she’s talking about.

I would love to sleep while she’s over here but I’ve expressed things I don’t want done with my child (like the 15 doses) of gripe water she wants to give him a day and I’m nervous that she won’t respect my wishes ,because she argues me down about things anyway, and she’ll do them because I’m not around. 

She literally just bust into the bathroom just now!!! like seriously! I’m about to take a walk or something like I have to get out of my own house.

Calling random ppl I don’t know so they can berate me about not wearing my belly band even though I said it was in the wash and I was waiting for it to dry. Like I can’t do this for another week. It’s been hell and I’m tired. 

Like I can’t even see what I’m typing because my eyes are so flooded rn ",2
"Hi all, I'm a 1st time mom and im not sure how to cope. I'm on medication(zolft 50 mg) and it seems to be helping and i dont know if i should up the dosage again because i dont like being dependent on medication, but I still have severe anxiety especially if im awake with the baby alone and my husband is still sleeping. My overthinking takes over. My anxiety is not about about my baby but about how my life changed and overthinking about the future. I feel like I made the wrong decision to have a baby i have even told my husband i regret having my baby even though this was a planned pregnancy. I feel bad because when someone wants to hold my baby i give her away without any hesitation. I feel like im never going to enjoy my new life and never going to enjoy being a mom.I have therapy scheduled but it's not for another month i have an appointment with a primary care dr but that one isnt for 2 more months, and i think my ob is tired of me already. I just desperately wish my appointments were sooner because I feel like I'm going crazy and want to run away anf just wanna talk to someone that will make me feel like im not crazy and that i will be ok!

She said she would bring something when she watches my daughter,but she isn't always available.) As for help it's been very very little. Now that I'm back at work I need someone to watch my daughter. I only work part time, so you think it would be easy. We'll my mom set up a chat to have a schedule on when people will watch her. At first I wasn't included in the chat. I had to ask to be added. She's my child I should know who's watching her. Most of the time people will watch her at my mom's place. So my mom (baby's grandma) gets help watching her, but me at night? None!. I ask for help like I'm supposed to, and am told no. Well as the most recent asking. 

I had come home from work after an 8 hour shift. Was getting ready for bed, and get a call from her doctor to go to the hospital due to leveled potassium. It's still high but not as high as it was. I was told we will not help you tonight. I need to help your mom cause she might have kidney stone surgery. We did it alone so can you. You are on your own, and don't yell or complain at us. 

Then, also told I NEED to give my mom access to my entire daughters medical history and give permission for her to make decisions for when something happens to me. Also, my mom and this family friend have given my almost 8 week old daughter plain water. I looked it up, and saw what it can do. I confirmed with my nurse friend, and she said NO waterm. We'll the family friend basically said she's giving my daughter water. But I said NO. So I will have to raise my voice saying she's my daughter, do not give it to her.

I told the doctor I saw today all of this, that I'm overwhelmed, and I'm doing as I should in asking for help. He basically said, well, you're a single mom. There is no help. You will go to work, and you will not sleep at night. You will do it all alone. 
All the stuff he said has made me feel even worse. He didn't seem like he wanted to put me on meds, and I feel terrible. I already struggle with asking for help, andcwhen I do i get treated this way. This is why I don't ask for help. I'm tired, and exhausted, and feel like no one is listening to me.",0
"Just wondering if anyone out there is going through the same thing.  I’m going through my second bout of PPD, this time with my 4 month old daughter.  I had it with my son and ended up being treated for it with meds and therapy, which helped a lot and I was able to wean off meds by the time he was around 15 months.  I’m back on the same meds and in therapy again, and I’m feeling way better than when the PPD first hit about a month-ish ago, but I’m still not back to 100% and I’m starting to get frustrated.  I feel like I’m doing all the right things - in addition to meds and therapy, I’m exercising, getting fresh air, taking breaks from the kids and making a little bit of time for my old hobbies - but I feel like I’ve plateaued and am stuck in this place where I don’t want to die anymore but I still don’t feel good.  I just want to feel like myself again so badly.  I guess I was just looking to see if anyone else is out there in the same boat so we can commiserate.  Since this isn’t my first go, I know it does get better, and I know it takes time too, but I’m feeling impatient and frustrated by my lack of progress these last few weeks.",0
"I’m hardly a “new parent” I guess now when my baby is now 14 months old but I’m wondering when I’ll get back into the swing of things. I’ve never been the best at being organized or clean by any means but ever since have a baby it feels  like my husband and I can just never catch up. My house is a disaster and it’s affecting our mental health. I don’t want it to affect our kids so I’m wondering what do you guys do to stay on top of things? Does it get easier? I wish sometimes it came naturally but it doesn’t and especially not now. I don’t understand how people have time to feed themselves, their kids, work, clean, and live a fulfilling life together. Any tips appreciated ♥️ thank you! ",0
"Suprise baby number 3. Had really bad ppd/ppa/ocd with my second so worried I’ll have it again, I know it passes but I don’t know if I can do it again. ",1
"I had my first child on Valentine's Day and I'm having such a tough time adjusting to motherhood. I'm pretty sure that I have postpartum depression and it's taking a toll on me. It's especially taking a toll on my relationship with my husband. 

A little background: I'm 34 (turning 35 in a little over a week). I've struggled with depression since I was 13, was diagnosed with MDD when I was 25 and GAD when I was 30. 

Since we started dating, I've been educating my husband on my depression. He's gotten better at understanding it through the 7 years we've been together (we've only been married for 3 months), but postpartum depression is a whole other thing. Pregnancy was a lonely time for me, but definitely not as lonely as postpartum. I feel so alone, empty, sad, tired, frustrated, lonely and forgotten. I cry so much because I'm so depressed and I get a frustrated ""Why are you crying again?"" — not just from my husband, from my mom too. I open up to him about being depressed and I'm met with ""Why are you depressed? What reason do you have to be depressed?"" He doesn't feel like I should be depressed because we have our son now. But that's why I am... Because I feel like I'm not being a good mom to him. Whenever I'm having a difficult time with him, I hand him off to my mom because if I keep holding him, I start sobbing in front of him. There are so many times I've cried while feeding him. I just let him sleep most of the time. I feel bad because I don't know if I should be doing activities with him and waking him up more. I wanted to breastfeed him but due to latching issues and him getting thrush twice already, I haven't been able to. We've just been feeding him formula since we got home from the hospital. I've pumped milk for him and fed him that successfully twice, but pumping is taking a toll on my body. I found out I should have been pumping since the beginning, but no one ever taught me that. It makes me feel like such a failure of a mother.

Even with our living situation... I feel like a failure. I was fired from my job in October. I've been on unemployment ever since. Prior to me being fired, I got my license to be a mental health counselor. I wanted to advance at my workplace and get started on my career, hopefully earning more money. But instead, I got fired. I keep beating myself up for it because my husband constantly voices his frustrations about how we live. We're basically living in the same apartment I've lived in since I was 2 years old. My mom and I have been here for almost 33 years and it's not comfortable anymore. We've just stayed here because it's rent controlled and we can't really afford to move. We've accumulated so much stuff and when I was pregnant, we moved stuff around so we could make more room for our son. We still haven't reorganized everything we moved around because it's been tough with the baby here. My husband moved in with us a few years ago and to this day, I haven't been able to make room for him to put his stuff. For the past few years, he's been living here with his stuff organized in separate bags and the rest of his stuff is in a storage unit we pay for. It's no way for a person to live. With my depression and my lack of energy and focus, I just let my own stuff accumulate and accumulate without making room for my husband and his things. I feel absolutely terrible about it. We can't afford to get a bigger place because then my husband will be living paycheck to paycheck and he'll have to dig into his savings, which is a down payment for a house we've been wanting to get. We haven't moved forward with that because I don't have a job and he will have no help paying the mortgage. It's unfair to him. I understand how frustrated he is and it breaks my heart knowing I'm playing a part in it. I try not to further burden him with my issues because I know I've burdened him enough already. Even the other morning, he left the house complaining. I saw how frustrated he was and I heard his complaints about how uncomfortable he is here, and that affected me a lot because once again, I was blaming myself for us still being in this situation because my dumbass got fired. After he left, I just sat in our room and cried and cried. Right now, I don't know if I raged or whatever, but my husband just voiced his frustrations about his belongings again and I emptied two drawers of one dresser I have so he can put some of his stuff in there. I stuffed all of my belongings into the duffle I used as my hospital bag and two plastic bags. I told him I don't wear anything that was in those drawers (which is a lie) but I just want him to stop being frustrated and throwing his frustrations at me. 

I thought I was making progress with him. Earlier tonight, he spoke to me about how much he loves me, and how in awe he is of me because of my giving birth to our son, and how he thinks I'm a great mom to our son, and how sorry he is about being so critical of me, and for coming home with bad energy when I'm eagerly awaiting his return. There was more stuff we spoke about, but overall, it was a great heart-to-heart conversation. And now, it all went to shit because of him getting frustrated about his belongings again. ",2
"It’s been over a year since my baby was born. The birth was pretty uneventful and I’m so thankful that everything went so well, and that’s why I feel even more guilty that I still have something to complain about. Me and my husband were living at my parents house at the time and my mom left on a trip so she wasn’t there about a week before the birth and about 2-3 weeks afterwards, so the support I thought I would have from her wasn’t there. When she came back, she wasn’t very interested in the baby and seemed almost upset with me that I didn’t want her around. I was so angry that she left me and then wanted me ti open up
To her about anything concerning the birth or the baby like she hadn’t left me at my darkest time. I have forgiven her, but it’s still something that had majorly scarred my mind postpartum. Before I was pregnant, I lost a huge portion of my family due to life circumstances and my community was basically uprooted and I felt rejected by those families, then after I got pregnant and because of these circumstances I lost a friend extremely close to me. She just kind of disappeared. She was like a sister to me, and I thought that she would be at the house every day and be like an auntie to my baby, but she was very uninterested in my life ever since I got married and it was a slow fade into nothing. She has nothing to do with my baby now and we barely talk. It was incredibly painful for me to lose her and it’s still something that I’m working through. 

I did have some support from my extended family, they checked in on me the first 1-2 weeks afterwards and brought meals. I had support, which is another reason I feel terrible for feeling this way and doubt that what I was dealing with was real PPD. Yet still, I had such a horrible time adjusting to being a mom, I feel like I’m doing better now but I’m not sure if I should get help for what does remain. 

I was very weak after birth so my husband took care of our baby the first night and I was completely incapacitated until the next morning. I feel so guilty that I don’t remember the first cry, I don’t remember the first night. I was completely unprepared for the issues I would have with breastfeeding (low supply, flat/inverted nipples), I just remember dreading anyone coming to see me or the baby but at the same time I so desperately wanted to be cared for and for someone to see me. I felt like I was living in a cave, scared and territorial and wild. I dreaded coming home and being confined to the bed to feed my baby (she took 1-2 hours each feeding) and needing to know where our meals would come from. Everything was about the baby. The reason people fed me was bc of the baby. It wasn’t because they really cared about my health and me, it was always. Ultimately. For the baby. My body felt so broken and weak and I just wanted to be left alone to heal but instead I have a newborn to care for. I was scared that a hair in the bassinet would make choke during sleep, I couldn’t sleep even when my husband would take care of the baby bc my mind would be racing and if I could hear crying I couldn’t sleep. I had horrible thoughts about the baby and felt such a disconnect. I just wanted to disappear and not be “the mother” anymore. I didn’t want to die, I just wanted to go to a time where my life was my own again. I wanted to be cared for without being expected to care. I was so so miserable and wondered what I have done and when things would be better, I saw NO end in sight, I was chained for life. Once I was healed enough, I would leave the house in the morning with as many bottles of formula and milk I could take, and not come home until it was run out and I had to go home. I couldn’t be alone with my thoughts and I was miserable and just surviving until my husband got home. 

I’m getting better now, i stay home a little more than I used to especially since it’s harder to get out of the house. I do sometimes still have the thoughts that I just want to disappear and not deal with anything but my bond with my baby is so much stronger and I have so much love to give it hurts. My problem now is, I used to share some things about my postpartum before I realized that not everyone has such a bad postpartum experience, and I would be met with some weird glances and awkward responses. I learned to not talk about how it was for me, but I have had a lot of people in my life have babies/get pregnant recently and I have these intrusive thoughts like “she’s so happy now, but just wait until all her friends abandon her like they abandoned me” or “she’s happy now but wait until she has a low supply and can’t breastfeed” I’ve just watched so many moms thrive and it makes me sooo hurt that no one related to my story, I couldn’t help anyone else, I couldn’t bond with another mom about how truly difficult it was. They had a great postpartum, had plenty of support, and they were and are happy mothers. They don’t want to hear my horror stories, it’s not relatable it’s ruining the mood. I know how horrible these thoughts are and I always rebuttal them in my head because I would NEVER wish my postpartum experience on anyone. But sometimes I just wish I saw someone struggle a little bit so I wouldn’t feel so alone and like a horrible mom for not enjoying motherhood for a  while and that still being something that needs progress a year later. Instagram makes it seem like everyone has a hard time and no one’s honest about it, yet it seems like IRL many moms have a great time and they are being honest about it. Please tell me. Should I go to a therapist? Is there something wrong with me, did I have PPD, or was I/am I responding and healing properly to life circumstances? ",2

I don’t feel like myself anymore at all. I feel like this empty shell that’s just going with the motions.  My Fiancé is really trying his best to make me happy but he's very practical minded and wants to fix things, so I don't get a whole lot of emotional support from his side. I just can’t seem to get a grip on how I’m feeling.

Baby has struggled with reflux from day 1, we were planning on exclusively breastfeeding but as I had a c section my milk didn't come in and it's been a struggle ever since. I've been through everything from not having enough milk, awful latch issues, painful cracked and bleeding nipples, bleeding into my milk to the point baby threw up blood, it's just been horrific. Breastfeeding has been a major part of me feeling so low, it's made me feel like a such a failure as a mum not being able to feed her myself (yet i really dont have this opinion of other mums who formula feed and im sure i wouldnt think like this if we hadnt had such awful problems with formula ourselves (severe reflux to the point of projectile vomits, trips to a&e out of dehydration fears, multiple doctors appintments, spent hundreds on different formulas, the list just goes on). 

 As my fiance is back at work I'm  taking the whole night shift, then looking after baba on my own for the whole day too until he finishes. I feel as though I'm stretched so thin that I’m going to snap. Then on top of all of that I feel immense guilt especially when i see her screaming with how uncomfortable she is and struggling so much just to eat.

I think about how things were before i fell pregnant a lot, we were engaged just a month before while on our first holiday celebrating our 5 year anniversary,  and I honestly miss how completely happy I was during that time...My fiance and i have always wanted kids, but we found out i was pregnant when i had just fallen out with my brother who also kicked us out, we had just gotten engaged a month beforehand and had to rush buying a house and moving to another country while i was 8 months pregnant. 

I adore my baby girl and I’d do anything to make her happy,  but I’ve completely lost myself since her birth, with all the added stress of her feeding issues, I just feel either constantly overwhelmed or completely numb. I don't want to feel like this anymore and I really miss who I used to be �.

I'm not totally sure why I'm writing this, I just feel so alone, I don't know if I have PPD or if my low mood is just expected with everything going on, I just wanted to shout into the void for a bit. If anyone has words of wisdom or even if you've gone through the same thing I'd really appreciate hearing I'm not the only one whose felt like this �

Does anybody else experience postpartum rage? i don’t see this talked about very much but it is the biggest struggle i am dealing with right now. The guilt and shame that comes with it is worse than the rage itself. i feel like i’m losing my mind constantly and hopeless.,1
"Hello everyone first time posting here. So me and my wife just had our first baby this weekend and we were so excited and we’re in love with her belly and the whole progress. Well the labor was a bad one, it ended up in having to be a border line emergency c section. Ever since she’s been not herself at all, we are home now and all she does is sleep, won’t eat and won’t even look or worry about the baby. She just cries and says she wants to be alone. It is tearing my heart apart because that is the woman I love and I hate seeing her like that. Will this get better with time? What can I do? Thank you ",1
"Hello, I’ve had the worst week of my mental health life. In short, I had PPA regarding SIDS which decreased then severe depression for two weeks when my 4.5 month old now started the regression (at 3.5 months) then I’ve been tethering a bit but still pretty happy (singing him songs, being a really engaged mother to both kids, doing lots of outings, patient) until his vaccines and a new regression last week (45 min-1 hour wake ups). My anxiety kept building and building with less and less sleep then not being able to sleep from fear of being woken up right away until it exploded and my whole body literally shut down. I thought I should have gone to the hospital (pacing, intrusive thoughts feeling like I went crazy from one day to the next), but I got help from my doctor and meds quickly. I am taking a sedative so I can get some sleep, and I’m on Zoloft. After one night I feel like my anxiety has decreased a lot. The past 3 days, I haven’t been engaging with my kids (4 and 4.5 months). My husband is doing it all. I’m so afraid as I was a very happy person with very minimal anxiety before and now I feel I need to be in a hospital almost or could have. 

I’m looking for some hope. Has anyone got to the point of shut down and such severe PPA all of a sudden? What was the recovery? How long for Zoloft to kick in so I can maybe function a bit? How long were you on Zoloft for if no prior symptoms (and you like how you feel normally pre-baby…if that’s possible again)? ",0
"I don’t know if it’s just the blues or Post Parton depression. Maybe even just crying spells, but I can’t for life of me, stop crying. 

I’m not sad, but I’m not overjoyed either. I don’t feel any disconnected, in fact o want my baby as close as she can get. Idk what I’m feeling or how to navigate it. I’ve set up an appointment with a specialist but it’s two weeks out. Any advice or experience would help. ",1
"I just look at her and I feel no love. No motherly instincts to protect her and keep her happy. I do take care of her of course, but mostly out of obligation. Looking at her just makes me angry and every sound she makes is like nails on a chalkboard. She feels like more of a burden than a part of the family. 

I miss my old life. I miss my old body and my old relationship with my husband. And though it's not even a little bit fair, I blame her for taking those things away from me. I hate her for it. 

I truly believe that becoming a mother was the biggest mistake of my life. I just wanna take it all back. I'm not cut out for this.   ",0
"Hi everyone, I’m thinking about starting a service that takes the headache out of finding mental health care by matching you with the right providers or resources. It’s designed to save you from insurance chaos and endless Google rabbit holes, especially when you’re juggling new mom life and feeling overwhelmed. Would this be something you’d pay for? I’d love your thoughts. ",
"My husband (38M) does help a lot with taking care of our daughter (6mo F). However with that being said I (28F) still do majority of the work. Which is fine with me since he works full time and I do not. I’m with her majority of the night until about 6am when she gets up I will “sleep in” until about 9am. Whenever I bring up issues I’ve been having with him he just throws what he does back in my face, is silent and ignores me, or breaks down crying. For example- I work all day Saturdays and one time decided to go out with friends after work, and then the next day had to also be away for majority of the day. Husband took care of our daughter while I’m away, and I’m very grateful to have a partner that is willing to step up while I’m away. Fast forward a few days later I’m trying to get our daughter down for a nap, and she is fighting it hard. Screaming, crying, all the things. I’m overstimulated. He’s just standing there staring at me, watching me run back and forth trying to calm her and make a bottle. After a while, I blurted out “why are you just staring at me?” He storms off into the other room. I took a deep breath and approached him and said “I would just appreciate it if you jumped in and helped.” Well that was the wrong thing to say. He starts yelling and cussing. He says I’m accusing him of never doing anything. He says after all he’s done it’s ridiculous that I act the way I do. He says I’m mean and it hurts his feelings. Things get very escalated with him yelling/cussing at me, and I tell him I’m not comfortable with him taking over at this point. He broke down crying and went to the other room again. Hours go by. I am always the one to approach later after a fight like this, and I will ask if he wants to talk and he usually says no. I try to bring it up at even later times and he brushes it off saying he would like to move past it. I can’t move past anything whenever we haven’t communicated about anything. It feels like things are swept under a rug. When I try to communicate how I’m feeling in a calm manner and safe space he usually breaks down crying and tells me to leave him alone and that’s the end of that. I’m really depressed. I’m tired. I feel like I’m so trapped and lonely and he just doesn’t understand what I’m going through. I feel awful seeing him cry. I don't feel like there's healthy communication between us, but when I try to address it I'm usually met with tears or silence. We go to couples counseling but can barely afford it so we don't go as often as we should. Is this normal? I feel like I'm the crazy one and my sense of reality has been warped. ",
I’m so tired. I love my baby. I love my husband. I’m so overwhelmed. I’m ready to be done. ,
"My husband and i have been married for 4 years, and we just had our first baby one month ago. Which means I'm one month postpartum and truth be told despite the lack of sleep and big adjustment, I've been in newborn bliss. I have no PPD or PPA. I had an extremely hard pregnancy and was miserable every single day and so i think im just happy to not be pregnant anymore. I love being a mom and despite having to have a C section, and breastfeeding issues, l've throughly enjoyed this new season of life... EXCEPT for my husband. He can lean on the side of not being super empathetic or understanding but i did not expect this side of him to come out. It really breaks my heart. I'm determined no matter what to not let him ruin this postpartum newborn bliss for me....but it's been very hard. He lets his emotions get the best of him and never actually listens to what i say unless im red in the face and emotional.
He's in counseling and says he might have PPD but how is it that i carried out child for 9 months and was incredibly miserable due to blood pressure issues and incessant nausea, got cut open, stitched back together, baby in the NICU and didn't get to meet him for 8 hours while my husband was able to, breastfeeding issues, and of course the hormone drop and im somehow more level headed and emotionally stable than him? He doesn't care to learn about what my body has/ is going through, thinks im constantly nagging him which maybe i might be, but he did little to no research about anything for this new season. There have been MULTIPLE instances where he has crossed the moral line and said incredibly hurtful things to me. He does a lot of the load around the house and helps me physically a lot...but i have little to no emotional support from him. He thinks i have ""the easy job"" because i pump exclusively, thinks i use postpartum as an excuse, says all i do is bitch and yell about stuff and he doesn't want to hear it...ex: i told him when taking care of the baby on his night shift he needs to be awake and vigilant because im afraid for the baby if he's asleep, and l've said that FOR WEEKS NOW and he gets so mad and thinks im belittling him but LAST NIGHT i get up to pump and our baby is face down in the sheets.... I told him this is what i ""nagged"" you about but you blew me off. I think im just ranting at this point because i know im not the asshole here, but i think sometimes maybe i am? But then i know for a fact my body has been through so much that there's no reason i should be treated this way...regardless of an attitude??? That was a lot but i think i needed to just get it out. I just wish things were different and didn't expect my husband to be so blunt and not understanding. just want to be heard and seen. I've told him that and he just says ""all you do is talk and just keep going i don't have the bandwidth for this.” ",
" 4 weeks PP with my second, my first one is 8. Every day since I’ve had my daughter has been simply painful survival, a blur. My husband works out of state and is gone but maybe 4 days a month. He left to go back to work when she was 5 days old. 

PPD started creeping in around week 2, then coupled with severe, gut-wrenching anxiety a few days later. I’ve been on 50mg of Zoloft my entire pregnancy but had to get a bump to 100mg plus Ativan and Buspirone. 

I honestly just hate waking up every day. My newborn never stops crying. Only wants to be held. She hates every fking swing and contraption we spent hundreds on. Hates to sleep at night. 

I hate my husband right now. He always comes home from being away and just sleeps all day then goes out with his friends at night. He provides me zero mental health support and even blames/shames me when I try to talk to him about how bad I’m struggling saying it’s 1.) my fault because I won’t go to the doctor. How do I even have the time when I can’t go anywhere with my baby? She screams every time she’s in the car and it’s miserable. I can barely do anything. My 8 year old son is equally miserable and missing his happy, active mom. I gave up everything to stay home to include a 6 figure career. Now my husband just constantly guilts me about how “broke” we are, yet doesn’t want me to go back to work.

I feel lost, dark, and just the worst I’ve ever felt. I’m borderline suicidal and have thoughts about just leaving everything. I thought this is the life I wanted, and honestly, majorly regretting it now which causes me even more guilt and shame. Help.",
"I feel like I'm going crazy, 6 weeks postpartum and I'm exhausted from the night feedings, the clusters during the day, all the poopy diapers, I never get time to myself. The shower isn't even worth it because most times I step out he cries or when I'm just about to get in. I can't play my game console because je cries when I start something...EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm exhausted and burned out I have no escape. I'm at the point I want to get blacked out drunk just to not worry for once. ",
"My husband and I got together in 2021, we got married in 2023. We both always said we didn’t want kids. For me, I knew the responsibility of a child was just something I didn’t want, for him it was more of the state of the world. Last year in February we took a vacation in Jamaica and he got really drunk and expressed that he did want a kid. I always knew deep down that he did want one and honestly I was willing to give him one, the timing just had to be right.

Fast forward to June of 2024, I found out I was pregnant. I wasn’t on birth control or anything (no form of birth control really agrees with my body) but we were always pretty careful and I had honestly convinced myself I couldn’t get pregnant so it definitely came as a shock. The timing was not ideal as we still haven’t bought a house yet and it’s getting seemingly harder to do that. 

My initial reaction was “my life is over”. I smoked and drank and it was just frustrating to me that I had to give that up before I had decided to do so. I wanted to get pregnant when we decided to not necessarily on accident but I would’ve hated myself if I got an abortion. I hated being pregnant. I liked how my body looked but it was super uncomfortable, I had no sex drive, I was constantly exhausted, peeing all the time. I did not enjoy it and I knew instantly I never wanted to be pregnant again.

Here we are now with a 3 week old and the depression is setting in. We had a baby boy via emergency c section (the placenta had a blood clot which was cutting off his oxygen during each Braxton hicks contraction). I’m glad I had a c section because if I had to bear the pain of real contractions or pushing him out I might have resented him. 

It’s only been 3 weeks and I feel trapped. Not by my husband but by the baby. He will sleep in his bassinet for my husband or his nana but if I put him down he is awake instantly. I get that he is still a newborn but I feel like he is so clingy already. Every night he sleeps on my chest because I can’t put him down or else he will not sleep. I miss cuddling with my husband or just laying in bed rotting. Call it lazy if you want but I knew how I was before getting pregnant which is why I didn’t want to just yet. I get that it’s the consequences of my own actions and I’ve accepted that but I can’t help but feeling so sad sometimes. Especially the past couple days baby wakes EVERY TWO HOURS ON THE DOT to feed. I’m exclusively breastfeeding because I think it’s just easier but I desperately just want one night of full sleep with just my husband. 

Some days I regret going thru with having him and I feel horrible that I feel that way. I feel like I’m grieving the life me and my husband had together without him. I don’t feel like I want to or would harm him at all but I just miss it just being us. I wasn’t ready but I’m an adult and made choices that led to having a baby so I know I have to do it. I feel like I’m just counting down the days until he’s a little more independent and I can have some time with my husband again. ",
"Has anyone ever had the feeling that they don’t like their children? For context, I have a 3 year old and a new born. I feel like I’m having a hard time connecting with my new born and I feel like I’m disconnecting from my oldest child. Everything my 3 y/o does makes me so mad and annoys me now and idk why because I was always so understanding with him. I’m scared to tell my partner because I feel like he’ll get mad at me, ik it’s not permanent because I love my children so much I just can’t understand why I feel this way. What can I do to be better at being more patient with both of my children but more so my toddler ",
"I feel like I’ve lost myself. My son is 20 months. I thought it got a bit easier for a while but now I feel more lost than ever. I feel like I’m not good at anything anymore. I feel like Im a half ass mom (absolutely love my son, but so touched out, longing for adult activities). 

I feel like I’m half ass at work. I’m not even half ass at anything self care. I haven’t seen the gym in years. I’m a blob. My friendships aren’t even half ass anymore. I barely reach out or hear from any of my “friends”. 

I sit here on the play mat going through the motions. When I look into the future I know I see one more child around my table, but how can I restart this with a baby?  I’m so stuck. ",
"The pain was so bad I felt like if I had a gun, I would’ve shot myself. 

I then went into bad postpartum depression that probably lasted one to two years. My partner was abusive and I divorced him at 2 1/2 years postpartum. ",
"i’m 12m pp (i survived the year!!!!) and i’m still really struggling with my friendships. early on i had a friend bail on me. she was a friend of 30+ years and i asked her to come help me while my partner was away. she said yes, but just a few days before a dinner came up that she said was really important to her so she wasn’t going to come. to say i was devastated is an understatement. i was already dealing with ppd and such a blow made me want to end it right there. it was just so overwhelming. 

since then i’ve really struggled to maintain any sort of healthy relationship. i never ask for help even though i really need it. i just can’t bring myself to feel so vulnerable.

any advice?",
Hi! How bad were the side effects for anyone who has taken it? I have it sitting on my counter and I’m terrified to take it because I read that you feel drunk for 2 weeks - but I think I need to bite the bullet and try it - can you get up and function / go to work the next day? Anyone else keep taking it with breastfeeding and/or on Wellbutrin? ,
"Hey everyone,

I’m 4 months postpartum, dealing with PPD, and struggling with constant irritability. Lately, my partner and I have been stuck in a loop of negativity and arguments. The smallest things he does get on my nerves so much easier than before, and he says my crankiness and frustration have pushed him away. But from my perspective, I feel like I’m always upset because I don’t feel loved or emotionally supported—he’s been distant, which only makes things worse for me. It feels like a “chicken or the egg” situation, and I don’t know how to break the cycle.

We’ve started couples therapy (had one session so far, another next week), and I really want to make this work. I just need advice on how to handle this at home in the meantime.

If you’ve been through something similar, how did you reconnect with your partner when everything felt tense all the time? Any tips for managing irritability and improving communication without every conversation turning into an argument?

I’d really appreciate any insights. Thanks!

"Im a new mom (6 months pp) vaginal delivery. I don’t have the need or want to be sexual with my husband but it’s ruining my relationship. I orally please him every once in awhile but it’s getting harder for me lately. I just went back to work after 5 months of taking care of my baby, I take care of him all day, cook for us and everything. It’s become a problem and I’m mentally going mad. I hide my depression and anxiety 99% of the time bec I hate being asked the question “are you okay”. I’ve started to feel like a burden to my husband, I don’t want to say or do anything that will piss him off becz I don’t want to deal with fighting all the time. We have tried to communicate and I want to be better but how do I get better for him if I can’t get better for myself? I cry almost everyday, I feel sorry for myself, I feel sorry for him, I feel sorry for our baby. We’re new parents and I keep resorting to the internet about questions if this is normal for new parents to fight all the time. I’m tired of being sad and a burden. Am I wrong…",
"This baby was SO wanted. We tried for years and battled infertility to have her. I thought once I was finally pregnant I’d be so happy and ready. 

Instead, pregnancy was not kind to me. I was sick constantly, it never let up. I lost 40 lbs because I just could not eat. It ruined my gallbladder and I had to have emergency surgery at 34 weeks pregnant. We were financially stable with good jobs but the cost of the fertility treatments and getting pregnant drained our savings. That would be fine, but then once I was pregnant I was too sick to work. I basically took the entire year of 2024 off so now we are struggling to catch back up and rebuild. We’re paycheck to paycheck and even then it’s not enough. Thankfully because of the dip in income we qualified for WIC and that has been a huge help. But being on government assistance makes me feel awful, especially because this baby was planned. We had our shit together I swear. It just… fell apart.

Now baby girl is here and she is so beautiful but I just feel…detached. I dread when she wakes up from her naps. She’s three months old and I am afraid she’s falling behind because I don’t really have it in me to play with her and do tummy time. Most days I just hold her and watch tv and when she doesn’t want to be held she’s in her playpen playing with her kick piano or in her swing. My wife works and is currently going back to school so she’s out of the house a lot and when she is home she has to do homework. So I am the primary parent almost 24/7 and the only break I get from the baby is when I’m at work, but I’m only part time so it’s not much of a break. 

I wanted so badly for my partner and I to be parents. I wanted so badly to be a mother that I was willing to put my body through hell to get it. I feel like an awful person saying that I regret my child but that is how I feel. I look at her and feel nothing. She’s cute and makes me laugh and she’s honestly a very easy baby, but I just don’t feel this pull toward her that I thought I would. Everyone told me, you know, once the baby is put on your chest the first time it’s like life is so different and a love you’ve never known. But I never had that feeling even when she was first born. She just feels like this stranger that I have to care for. I think I love her? She’s my baby right so I feel like I do at least a little, but I mourn my life before her. I miss having money to burn and free time and just not feeling so much… nothingness.",
10 weeks postpartum struggling with binge eating and purging because of weight gain has anyone ever took these two drugs at the same time also still currently breast-feeding,

I struggled during post partum after a traumatic pregnancy and birth. However what I struggled with most was intrusive thoughts that I didn't deserve my husband and that I had cheated on him. I was seeing a couple of guys before we became official but cut it all off because I wanted him. This was 4 years ago. It never crossed my mind until I was 8 weeks post partum and I felt like I had to tell him EVERYTHING which I did but it didn't make me feel any better. I somehow recovered but now 2 years post partum (if you can call it that) the same issue has arised and I can't handle it. It's put me into depression and given me so much anxiety that I can't work and feel guilty everyday. Has anyone else ever been in this position? Is my brain punishing me? I also feel like everyone would be better off without me.,

"I had a micro premie 2 weeks ago. My little rainbow baby was born at 24 weeks. He is currently in the NICU and will be for at least 4 more months up until his due date. I have cried every day since he was born. I felt it hard to bond with him since I haven't been able to hold him yet. He has had a little episode with aspirating milk and choking which was extremely traumatizing to watch.I am  pumping to supply him with milk. I love him so much but I'm drowning. The NICU is 2 hours away from my home, i am currently staying at the ronald mcdonald house. I have been hospitalized since I was 22 weeks because of an incompetent cervix. I've been on FMLA but it ends in April so I'm worried about that as well. I've been going through insurances worried about my babies medical coverage because NICU is costly. Finally got him on my work insurance and Medicaid to assist with all of this. I'm just tired, and sad and worried. I feel so lonely. My racing thoughts about financial stability and my babies health and my family and everything keep me up at night. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to not feel this way. I have been keeping it together because I have a lot to think about, getting him set up for programs etc, but the paperwork stresses me out too... his dad works because he is currently the only source of income. He comes down on his days off but cannot stay. I need help so bad. I want to feel mentally healthy to be able to help my son. ",
"I have a 13 y/o and am wanting to have another now. I had some pretty miserable PPD within about 3-5 days of having my son. I made the mistake of trying to stay away from meds and “handle it” but it got so bad after a few weeks I was sobbing and scared all the time didn’t want to be left alone with my son. My mom got me to the MD when I couldn’t care for myself anymore. 2 weeks on meds and I started to feel much better. 

I want to have one more and my husband also wants one more. I’m excited and I’m terrified. PPD was so hard (I had way less support, less stable partner, first time with depression, less income)… I thought I was losing it and a terrible mom. Have you guys been able to get pregnant and not re-experience it or have it be much milder? ",
"I’ll be picking up my anti depressant today. Celexa if anyone can tell me how it was for them that’d be great!

Took therapy, self reflection and talking to my best friend to realize I probably have been struggling with ppd/ppa. The doctor didn’t ask questions just took my word that my therapist suggested I should get checked. 

Holy crackers was hearing the doctor say all the things that checked the boxes of what I’ve been feeling/doing cemented it for me.

It’s kind of freeing knowing the person I’ve become isn’t me, that this isn’t permanent. 

Just that 30 minute appointment I fell a huge weight off me, so if your on the fence do it. ",

"I will be 9 months PP on the 12th. I’ve been struggling with ppd since the birth of my daughter in June. My fiancé was a godsend immediately after birth as I was dealing with complications and health issues for the first couple months. We starting butting heads in October and had a big argument on Halloween, he cheated on me after with a coworker of his, who was also postpartum and was supporting her through her ppd and talking badly about me as a partner and mother and I found out a week later we agreed to try and work things out. Since then I’ve struggled with my self worth and relapsed in my ED. I knew I was gaining weight but it was slowly at first. Then on new years we had a big fight I outted him for cheating in front of family and friends and he used all my insecurities and fears as ammunition in our argument. I’ve spiraled since then and gained a substantial amount of weight in the last couple months. Food seems to be the only thing I find comfort in. When I try to diet to combat it my milk supply starts to decrease and it’s a big goal of mine to breast feed up until a year. I recently had a dr appointment and when they weighed me I have gained over 50 lbs since my daughter was born. I am the heaviest I have ever been and it’s led me to start purging again. I hate everything about myself now and am starting to resent my partner because of it. I feel so lost. I don’t think my self esteem will ever recover. ",
"I'm burned out today, I spent most of the day caring for my two children. My oldest is 16 months and starting his terrible twos I think, meanwhile my youngest is 5 weeks and is extremely colicky. I have no clue what to do. The baby is literally screaming and crying all the time and nothing is helping besides holding him but I don't want to/can't hold him all day and hes breastfed so it would be alot. I've tried feeding him differently, bottle feeding (after I pump), burping him immediately, burping half way, changing the way I burp him, gripewater, ovol, let him lay on my chest, and even hold him tummy down. While the 16 month old is destroying his crib, he fights his naps, screams his head off, won't eat, throws food around, drinks too much milk (6 baby bottles a day minimum), fights when he gets his diaper changed, throws his toys, and feeds off his brothers energy. I'm at the point where I have no clue what to do, I want to scream my head off whenever I hear one of them start. Any advice for how to deal with them would be appreciated ",
"My baby is about 19 months and I just lost my job as part of the federal cuts. I felt like I had found an identity beyond just being a mom after months of PPD and now I feel like I’m right back where I started, having to figure out who I am in addition to a mom again. Beyond that I’ve always been a remote worker since my son was born and the idea of having to go to an office and leaving him everyday is destroying my motivation. And I feel like nobody in my life really understands how much this is hurting. I try to keep it together all day for our sweet boy but as soon as he goes down I just cry. This journey is real rough some days �",
"I am a mom of a 6 month old baby boy, I am finishing my education degree, SAHM and my husband and I AGREED to get into the new house and put up a fence before buying a dog. Well apparently none of that mattered. Because we are still in our apartment (2bed) with a cat, a puppy (8 weeks) and a baby all while prepping to move, and finish school. I genuinely am so upset and irritated with my husband as I constantly remind him over overwhelmed I feel every day with what I currently have going on, and he brings home a puppy without asking/telling me. Because now that puppy is my responsibility because he works very long hours. I need help/ recommendations of what to do to cope because this is seriously too damn much, and makes me cry all the time from the stress. ",
"Posted this in the breastfeeding sub but figured it makes more sense to post here too. My lil girl is almost 6 months and I'm now switching to bottle feeding/formula. I exclusively breastfed this whole time but my mental health has taken a huge hit and last night I landed myself in the hospital. l've been trying to wean and feel so torn with wanting to stop for my mental health and getting the help I need while also still wanting to nourish and comfort my little babe. I'm literally grieving through this now and keep crying every time I give her a bottle. For my health and safety, it's what I need to do. Just wanted to see if anyone else can share how they got through the emotional part of weaning and how they might have coped. Hugs to all of you. Motherhood is really hard right now.",
"I am struggling mentally and I’ve never been at such a loss. I’m very in tune with my mental health, but try as I might, I’m struggling to put to words what I’m experiencing so I’m finding it hard to find a solution. I’m in therapy, I have good family support, love my kids to death, my mood is good most days, but I feel so stuck. I have a million and one things to accomplish and I feel like my brain is on strike. In the past I have just journaled then deciphered the action items and listed them all out. If that was too big I would split the actions into easier to accomplish bits and then slowly chip away. I’ve tried that and still just stare at the list unable to move forward. I can do it for someone else, but not for myself. The biggest issue I’m having is food fatigue. I have three kids (4,2,1) and the one year old has a dairy allergy and my husband is in heart failure which means dinners have to be planned with restrictions in mind. I will spend so much time looking at every label for ingredients that I get lost in grocery shopping for hours and then miss the chance to even pick up an order because I never got it placed. I spend so much time meal planning, prepping, cooking, serving, etc that by the time I’m done at least 75% of the time I either completely forgot to sit down and eat myself or couldn’t stomach the idea of eating after thinking of food so much. I’m very overweight but have never been an overeater. I just have a very slow metabolism and PCOS. I have been counting the calories I am consuming and most days I don’t even reach 1,000 calories because I’m so deterred from eating. I have talked about it in therapy and with the doctor. We’ve adjusted all my meds. My mood is honestly doing really well. My energy levels are finally improving, but I just feel so stuck and unable to take care of myself. ",
Hey y’all just wanted to provide some feedback on my experience with zurzuvae. Im an FTM and knew 3 days PP something didn’t feel right so I spoke with my doctor and we decided to try zurzuvae. I started it anticipating being incredibly fatigued but I found that I didn’t experience that at all. I would say I feel better but there’s definitely still a cloud that’s lingering and I finished the 2 weeks 2 days ago. So just wanted to put out there that I don’t think it hurt but I didn’t find it to provide the significant relief I’ve heard it described as providing. I’m starting Zoloft next week to see if there can be any additional improvements post finishing the zurzuvae course ,
"I was there. I wanted a baby more than anything. I did fertility treatments and was thrilled when I finally got pregnant from IVF. Now I have a three month old and I am miserable. I love my baby (I didn’t at first so this is progress) but I don’t like being a mom. I feel like I ruined my life. I have people close to me who are trying to conceive now; one of my friends is in fertility treatments and was exactly the way I was just a year or so ago (desperate to be a mom, devastated when the cycle is unsuccessful, excited about the prospect of having a baby) and I just wish I could tell her to slow down and think about what’s going to happen when she has a baby. The sleepless nights, the feelings of helplessness when you have no idea what you’re doing, the loss of freedom, the hormones, the financial burdens, the fights with your spouse. I don’t want to ruin her enthusiasm but I wish someone had warned me. ",

"LO is 8 weeks old now, the first 4 weeks were absolute bliss and me and my husband were in this wonderful baby bubble at home and nothing bothered us for that 4 weeks. At 5 weeks he went back to work, my mother came to stay a week or so and now she’s gone for about 2 weeks (thank god)- and WHY is it so much easier to be alone with the baby? Why is it easier to clean the house? Why is it easier to take care of myself mentally? My mother and I have a very strained relationship from day one anyway so her being here made it exhausting mentally and she made everything harder. Now.. and at an increasing rate.. my life is easier when my husband is at work. I love him to death I do, I couldn’t imagine my life without him and he’s a great dad, but I CAN’T STAND HIM! Why?? I don’t understand why everything he does annoys me, why he does/says such stupid things and is always in my way. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve had influenza a causing laryngitis the last week and I have zero voice, at all. He keeps asking me questions that require me to talk after I asked him (through text) to ask me yes or no questions or to try and understand my (limited) ASL and hand gestures. It’s driving me nuts. We got in a fight yesterday because he said “it must not be that bad if you’re not complaining about it or taking anything” when I have NO VOICE TO COMPLAIN WITH and I’m breastfeeding so there’s nothing I can take but Tylenol! This was later apologized for and he realized why the statement was stupid. Now today I ask him to bring me my pump and he says “Ok” hands me the baby and goes and does 50 other things instead of bring me my pump. I can’t even yell for him from the bedroom and be like “where’s my pump?” Or “hey you forget my pump?” No I’m freaking mute. Since my c-section I’ve struggled to sit up especially with baby’s weight on me. I was laying down when he put the baby on me and while I could get up if I really tried I didn’t want to feel the stabby pain so I tried to just wait and he never came. I laid there and cried for a minute with the baby and then got up. That turned into a fight. He did the same thing yesterday about picking up groceries, I told him if he wanted me to I could go get them. He said “Ok” and then when it came time “Can you take him so I can go get the groceries” I of course did and he went and got them, when he came back he was running late for work and then started to yell at me that I don’t do anything and I couldn’t even get my ass up to go get the groceries. I SAID DUDE YOU DIDN’T TELL ME YOU WANTED ME TOO??? Why does he say “Ok” if he isn’t going to or doesn’t want to do the thing?? He apologizes and tries to go back to normal and he really does try to make up for it and I feel like normally I’d let it go but lately I just despise him. I want him to go away. Why? I know my therapist is beating around the bush with the idea that I have PPD rage. But how do I stop hating him? I want that 4 week “baby bubble” back where we couldn’t have been more in love with each other. ",
"Hi every one I may not be the typical poster but I’m just looking for some help. I have been with my girlfriend for 8 months I can genuinely say that she is the love of my life. When we met she was pregnant from a previously extremely abusive relationship. She’s an amazing woman and absolutely incredible, she had her baby 2 months ago. The first month was different but nothing bad she was happy and her normal self, a month ago I noticed a dramatic and nearly polarizing shift in her. She went from very affectionate too not wanting too be touched. Me just placing her hand on my back which used to comfort her as she is under a lot of stress now makes her uncomfortable. She acts extremely cold towards me which as lead too a lot of fights recently. I’ve just been trying to understand how too help her and what she needs from me which often is met with a “I don’t know” from her. We used too do things together often but since I saw that shift all she wants to do is hang out with her friends, we get zero personal time any more at all she barely even wants to speak too me yet she seems 100% normal with her friends. I love her daughter with everything in me and look at her as my own and she has stated that she sees me as the father (bio dad is not worth the air he breathes) I travel for work so we only get to see each other on weekends mostly we have plans for this weekend where I will be watching lil miss (the baby) so she can go out dancing with her friends. When she asked me to do so I gladly said I would because I enjoy my time with lil miss and I want her to go out and have fun. And so I asked if we could spend the day together Sunday before I drive back to work 4 hours away. Today while driving too see her she texted me and told me she was going too an event Sunday morning that would last all day. I was disappointed but I’m trying hard too be understanding. So I asked if we could have watch a movie and hang out tonight. 1 hour away she told me her friend was coming over so I sat there and talked with her and her friend from 9:00 pm till about 10:30pm till her friend got a phone call from a guy she is talking too and they spent the next 45 minutes talking too him on the phone. So I get up and go shower and get in bed. At 12:15am she comes in and asks why I didn’t wait for her because she wanted too shower with me and got mad that I went and she says I hid in the room. She asked what was wrong and I told her I just want personal time with my girlfriend. Which lead to an argument where she tells me I’m adding too her stress. I’m not raising my voice or getting upset I mostly just listen too her and let her vent. After she calms down I ask her what she needs from me and she tells me she just needs my presence and patience. I love this girl and I just want too help her but I’m so confused because acts so warm too her friends and so cold too me. I don’t know what to do if any one has advice it will be unbelievable appreciated. 

Thank you and I hope any one that is struggling  is able too pull through the bad and heal. ",
"I'm thinking of telling my doctor I'd like some help managing depression but I'm scared. I always downplay how I feel bc I'm embarrassed to need help and tbh I don't really like my OB and being even more vulnerable in front of him than I already am is going to be very hard for me. But I'm really starting to struggle. I just don't know what to even expect. Are they going to just prescribe antidepressants? Or send me to a therapist?

"I got Escitalopram prescribed today. 
But I’m too afraid to take it after reading the likely side effects.

With my first baby I think I had ppd (I couldn’t get out of bed for a fortnight. I didn’t eat for around 6 days. At one point my mum was spooning water into my mouth just to make sure I had some fluid in me. I was at the point where if I didn’t have a wee in the next 24 hours they were going to have to send an ambulance). During this time I took one sertraline tablet and got the craziest side effects and didn’t take any more. 
But, With rest and support, I guess I just got better. I can’t remember when, how or how long it took but I did. I do t think it actually took me too long. I’m not sure what or how but something just got me better!

This time. I feel worse. But it hasn’t got to the point like I was above. Mainly because I have a four year old that needs me too. And I just can’t have these being his first core memories.

But, I’m terrified of those possible side effects. I can’t risk feeling any worse than I already do, even if it’s just for a week!

Has anyone here beaten ppd without meds?
If so, how. 
I need to be better. I want to be better.

Also to add, I am at my worst in the mornings!! I feel better and better as the day goes on. But it’s taking me longer and longer each day to start to come out of it. 
A kind person on here did give me some super advice and info about this type of situation, but if anyone else has managed to beat this please let me know how!

"This is going to be long, sorry. I have a two year old and a 6 month old. I haven’t been doing well. My two year old goes to daycare full time and my typical day consists of my toddlers morning routine…potty time, getting her dressed, hair and brushing teeth, breakfast, and getting to school. Most days my husband helps with our 6 month old but I still have to get her in the car with my two year old. Then she comes back home with me and I try to take care of her, clean/organize the house, get some work done when she naps, make lunch, make dinner, then get her back in the car to pick up my toddler. My husband will usually help around dinner time with our 6 month old but I don’t get a break at that point. I do my toddlers nighttime routine. Some days that can be 5 hours long or more. On top of that my infant wakes up like 4 times in the night and sometimes my toddler wakes up once or twice. I’m just exhausted, today was my first shower in a week...I feel like I never have time to even pee. The point of this rant is because I’ve been finding myself getting angry and snapping at my infant. I’ll tell her to shut up when she starts pulling on my hair and crying non-stop. This after I’ve tried rotating her at all her stations, feeding her, rocking her and I’m usually trying to get something done at the same time. I just snap. Then I find myself coming out of it and wondering why I acted that way. Just today she slipped out of her Bjorn bouncer and fell forward, she didn’t hit anything hard but her face was against cold concrete. I was trying to get something done and didn’t notice until she cried. I feel like a terrible mom. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I find myself detaching from my maternal responses to her needs. Besides talking to a therapist, what is recommended to try at home? ",

"I am 9 weeks postpartum.  I am struggling with anxiety, intrusive thoughts and depression. Before getting pregnant, I was on antipsychotics and anxiety medication daily and had been for many years. When I found out I was pregnant, my OB took me off of my meds due to the risks and unknown of of my antipsychotic. I have not been back on anything since. Originally, I was to restart them at 37 weeks. I ended up getting induced at 37 weeks due to hypertension. Fast forward, I was doing good after baby being born and leading up to it for the most part. Minus outside stressors.  Over the first 6 weeks postpartum I started to develop anxiety and discussed this with my partner. The fears I have of my baby passing in her sleep or choking on her milk, etc. Basically just stressing about the worse things. He doesn't really understand. I have been at home with baby since she was born and didn't know if I will go back to work. He doesn't want me to so our daughter doesn't have to go to daycare all the time or be with a family member all the time while we both work. I am having a hard time with feeling like I'm not contributing to expenses.  

In the beginning, he was home for 3 weeks after she was born and was up with me and baby, fed her at night so I could sleep at times, washed bottles/pump parts as needed and overall was very helpful. Well since he went back to work, he no longer gets up with me at night, which I understand he goes to work early. He has not since washed a single bottle or pump part since.  I feel as if everything at home with the baby has become solely my responsibility. I do the cooking, cleaning, care fo the pets and the baby. It's hard to ask for help because I feel like I'm supposed to fully do everything or when I do, it feels like it's an inconvenience. I want him to be able to enjoy his hobbies still but I have no time for myself. I have only left the baby twice since her birth. Total time of 2 hours tops.  I know I'm suppose to set time aside for myself but I feel guilty asking for help. My partner and I have talked and he says he feels like I don't want him to help. Overall I'm struggling. I have been seeing a therapist and have an appointment to get back in my meds next week. My OB, the pediatrician and my therapist are concerned about my mental health.  When I bring up the fact that I am struggling being home all time, and constantly doing something for someone else, I'm told ""well you can go back to work and I'll stay home"". I feel shitty for wanting time for myself or even asking for help.  I struggled with breastfeeding in the beginning and now pump to feed. I hate pumping but I don't want to do formula if I can avoid it. Everytime I'm asked how I'm doing and I tell the the truth that I'm struggling, Im basically written off by the person asking. No one calls me to ask home I'm doing or to even talk to me. They only want to see how the baby is and come to see her.  Everyone with ask my partner how I am which in turn he says I'm doing good when he knows I'm not. It's just hard. I love daughter but I'm struggling with the loss of identity and not feeling validated for my feels by those around me. 

Any tips? I'm sorry for Being all over the place. ",
"I’m coming up on a year postpartum and I feel like my anxiety has been worse than ever. I started back on anxiety medication (lexapro was prescribed) however, I’ve been having more frequent panic attacks as well as an increase of physical symptoms- hot flashes, lightheadedness/dizziness, decreased appetite , stomach problems, psoriasis flares, etc. It’s starting to really affect my relationship and I’m struggling wanting to even go to work though I love what I do. I guess I’m maybe wanting insight to others experience and the best way to tackle this problem. I’m lost ",
"I am a single mother to a 5 month old and I'm in a cursed legal battle with the father who doesn't care about her only cares so he can control me. I had a baby with him because we were going to be a family, happy and together but that didn't happen.
Lately I have been struggling really badly with my mental health, I want to throw her some days because of my mental health but I don't. She is such a happy baby who smiles whenever I cry and only cries when she's hungry.
I don't want her anymore, I want to give her up and I can't because she won't be safe with the father because of him and his family. I don't want her to go to him but I also don't want her and I can't keep dealing with this. Some days I want to die and hurt myself. I'm not going to do anything though. Most days I wish she would die from SIDS because I can't do this. I can't deal with her father, I can't deal with the stress, I just want to be free of motherhood. I can't talk to anyone about because I'm alone in this, everyone in my life thinks they understand but they don't. I do every night wakeup, most nappies, the routine, the play time and the feeding. I am really struggling. I think I might have postpartum depression. I'm so goddamn alone.
When I fought with my mother about it, all she said was you shouldn't have had a baby so soon in my relationship with him. Can I just give her up? I want my life back.",
"I have birth a little over 2 weeks ago to a baby girl. I feel no attachment to her. I cry because I'm scared. What if I never wanted a baby? My partner is the most amazing husband. He is so there for me and helping me the best way he can, reassuring me in whatever area I need reassurance.

But I am not happy. At all. I hate pumping. I hate not having autonomy anymore. I hate that I have to think about someone else before I do anything. I hate talking about motherhood or babies. Everything is exhausting. My knees and legs are in pain. I'm grateful for my support system because I know many don't have one but I'm still not happy. I also hate feeling this way because I see how it's affecting my husband. I see that I'm stressing him or worrying him and I can't stop it. I'm trying to stop or feel better but I can't fake it that long. 

I feel so weak. I have everything. A safe home,food, medical care, everything I need. And I'm very grateful for it. And I'm still sad. I feel suffocated thinking this is my life and there's no way out. 

I just keep wanting to die. I won't act on it. But I want to die.",
"So I'm 4 months PP, and for the last maybe... 3 months I've had terrible PPD. At first it was just mood swings, feelings of hopelessness, feeling worthless, being annoyed with my partner because he is the type to say ""well complaining isn't gonna fix anything"" instead of being supportive when i try to talk about my feelings to him. For the last month I've had horrible intrusive thoughts/paralyzing fear of my baby dying while im taking care of her. (Biggest things are fear of her choking while I or anyone is feeding her, fear of her spitting up in her sleep on her back and choking, aspiration, etc). My partner knows about this, and I've explained to him how serious this fear is. anytime i am alone with her (bf is in school, has a job and a band, so he's outta the house regularly) i literally have a panic attack if ever she chokes on formula while im feeding her, and after that all day i am hyper focused on her breathing and feel like its always abnormal and hate myself because im scared she'll die and it'll be my fault. Partner has recently told me that he feels like sometimes i say that I can't feed her and I want him to do it just because I don't feel like it, not because I'm actually scared of anything happening to her. Basically saying that i use this fear out of laziness. He's made comments while arguing like ""... Yeah well at least i AM ABLE to feed our daughter"", ""act like a parent instead of a teenager"" or ""deal with it, stop complaining"". It hurt my feelings so much that he would 1. Think that i would do something like that. 2. Invalidate this fear that is taking over my brain to the extent where i dont feel like im able to keep my daughter safe, feel like a horrible mom, and feel incompetent 100% of the time.

Im already on meds for the PPD, i already am seeing a therapist and so far nothing has helped.

Has anyone's partner reacted similarly to their PP mental stuff?",
"Let's help each other! Having the right support can make all the difference. I wanted to share a few things that have helped me in hopes they might help someone else too: 

1. Therapy – Finding the right person to talk to was a game changer for me. It wasn’t instant, but over time, I felt more like myself again.
2. Books & Podcasts – Good Moms Have Scary Thoughts by Karen Kleiman was a lifesaver in normalizing intrusive thoughts, and the ""Momwell"" podcast helped me feel understood.
3. Apps – I used the Balance meditation app for quick mindfulness exercises when my anxiety felt overwhelming. Breathing exercises are amazing sometimes too. Also, the *Peanut* app helped me connect with other moms going through the same struggles.
4. Journaling & Gratitude – Some days, all I could write was “I made it through today.” But looking back, I see how far I’ve come. Small wins matter.
5. Mom Support Groups – Whether online or in-person, just talking to other moms who *get it* made me feel so much less alone. I have a few close friends who were also pregnant and sharing our experiences you really realize you aren't alone

What has helped *you* the most? Let’s share and help each other through this",
"You guys. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE talk to your docs or a homeopath about progesterone supplementation for postpartum mood disorders (or really any hormonal mood issues). 


I’ve had debilitating PPA since having my son 4months ago. I got on an SSRI right away and have switched meds multiple times because they weren’t working for me. You can be on progesterone while on an SSRI and breastfeeding. I am on day 9 of 10 days of pills (everyone might be advised differently, my doc said to discontinue use once I feel 80% better) but I felt a big difference in mood after 4 days, and my anxiety was so much better by day 6. Please take it into consideration, more women need to know about this!! Lmk if you have any questions. ",
"Howdy, FTM here, with the most gorgeous 3 month old rainbow baby, who for this post I will call “Pickle.” I recently went back to work two weeks ago and so far the adjustment has been doable but also a little bittersweet. Pickle is being watched by my long time friend, who I will call Ally for this post, and Ally has two little girls of her own. Her house is clean, there’s bright colors, and my baby LOVES getting to hang out there. When I drop her off in the morning she just smiles and chatters and lights up and I love knowing she’s somewhere safe. But I can’t shake this feeling in my bones that Pickle will grow up thinking that Ally is her mommy. I feel like I’m babysitting my own kid overnight until it’s time for her to go “home.” For my situation being a SAHM is not an option at this time, I’m sure I could ask for shorter hours at my job (I work for a private practice oral surgeon) 
I know it takes a village, and I’m supposed to lean on my village to help. But I need to know; does my baby know I’m still mommy when I pick her up? Is she happy when I take her home? I know this is all completely my own feelings and they are big feelings. Forgive me if I’m all over the place, I’m on my lunch break and taking breaks between ugly sobbing and bites of ramen noodles. I hate this feeling. Ally has gotten so attached to her and quite frankly she’s the safest person I know that I can afford to watch Pickle during the day. I just need to know I’m not alone and possibly an internet hug from another parent who feels this way. ",
"I feel good in all other aspects other than the fact that I feel incredibly self conscious and that my husband deserves so much better. When we got together (about 4 years ago) we talked about how we both had a past & that’s never bothered me. But after having my baby all I can do is think about the other woman he’s slept with & it makes me feel so incredibly self conscious. It makes me feel even worse that my husband goes above and beyond to make me feel loved. But I just can’t help that my mind trickles to that one time he told me about the chick he f*cked in his car, etc... Ugh. I’m so frustrated that my mind keeps doing this. Crying has become an every other day thing. I’m so tired of it. I also fear that my husband will grow tired of my self conscious and be annoyed that I continue to feel this way. It just doesn’t make sense to me that I keep thinking about this thought process. IM the one who got to marry him. IM the one who got to make him a father. Ughh. So frustrating. ☹️�",
"I have been dealing with severe postpartum anxiety since about 3 weeks postpartum. She was wanted, we did IUI to have her. My baby was born at 35 weeks due to severe preeclampsia, and I knew something was wrong as soon as I had her. I did not have a deep love for her and I wanted them to take her away. I contemplated giving her up with Safe Haven laws more times than I care to admit.

I immediately called my OB and got into their postpartum mental health program, increased my Lexapro, started therapy, went to support groups, etc. I'm now 11 weeks postpartum and added Ativan twice daily, I've been slowly improving but I still miss my old life, I miss being with my husband, I miss not having this constant worry and responsibility for another life. I hope I continue to improve but there are still days where I wonder if I should admit myself to the hospital, or if people would be better off without me, or if I should give the baby to someone else. I just hope it gets better, soon",
"Before I had my kids, my cat was my life. We have two, one is attached to me and the other to my husband. They were my fur babies. I spent all my money on giving them the best life possible and I was the crazy cat lady. Obsessed doesn’t cover it. When I got pregnant I told my husband I genuinely didn’t think I could love my kids as much as my cat. We ended up having twins and from the moment we brought them home, the love I had for my cat vanished. I hate him. He is a quarantine cat so he’s super needy and cuddly and I used to love it but now whenever he comes for pets it makes me so mad. He sleeps with me which was great until I’m desperate for every minute I get and I’m woken up 5 times a night not by my babies but by the cat. And if I lock him out of the room he will scratch at the door and scream. I’m touched out when the kids go down for their naps I just want a break but here comes the cat wanting love. He is low man on the totem pole I can’t push away my kids but I need a break from being touched so I shoo him away. Which causes him to have behavioral issues which just makes everything worse. I used to worship the ground this cat walked on and now even seeing him pisses me off. It’s not his fault and I feel really bad but I just can’t deal with two babies and the cat. Before having my kids I always thought people who rehomed animals were monsters but I’ve thought about it every day. It’s been over a year and I was hoping the love I had for him to come back but it just hasn’t. I make sure the cat has a good life, he always has fresh water and food and a clean litter. And I force myself to pet him and let him sit on my lap. But I hate him so much. If I had known this would happen I wouldn’t have adopted him he deserves better. ",
"I want people know that I am happy for mothers with babies; I know most people are here have PPD/PPA and a baby or even maybe a toddler. I also think it's okay for someone in my situation who might not be feeling that way, I just happen to be okay there. Regardless..

I am full of rage because I miscarried at the end of the first trimester and I have PPD/PPA, intense ANGER, etc my life feels turned upside down and there is also NO BABY!!!!!!!!!! There will never ever be another baby for me, my kids are bigger now and the miscarriage was a surprise pregnancy so we won't be trying again. It wasn't a good idea in many ways and yet the 3rd baby door opened for a second in my brain before slamming shut on me again! And then having my hormone levels drop like that.. I am so upset that part of my life with babies is over. I'm livid that I feel this way with postpartum depression AND I also don't have a baby. I don't understand why women feel this way after giving birth or why they should have these feelings with a baby. But I also can't fucking understand where is MY baby?! I don't get one!?!?! WTF.

I am so ANGRY and fucking sad and full of grief that my baby died and I never expected any of this. My stroller is in the garage and I'm grateful for the time I spent pushing it but it also hurts much more than it did before with this open wound in my heart. I feel a grief I hadn't imagined and then I feel guilty feeling it because I love my children and I am lucky to have both of them. I hope this feeling passes in time. I was at peace with the baby and toddler phases of my life being over but this has made it feel like I am not anymore. I keep wondering how long I will be at the bottom of this well. I know I have to wait and be with it but I am really having a hard time functioning like this.",
"My ppd is making a mess of me, I find myself crying more than usual and I cannot stand it. 
My baby is 10w and he’s changing everyday, today, while changing his clothes, I realized how big he is getting. I’m so sad I’m not taking in these moments and appreciating them in the present. I’m a zombie, I don’t even feel like I’m mentally there half the time. I cater to my baby’s needs 100% but I don’t take everything in.

He smiles constantly with those innocent eyes and all I want to do smile back with real emotions but all do is smile through tears.
I should be happy! He’s everything I wanted plus more. 

I just want to be happy again.",
"My baby is almost 5 months now. It seems like everything is just really heavy lately. He screams pretty much the entire time he is awake and is very difficult to out to sleep. I have taken him to the Dr multiple times and they just don't care. I tried switching formula and it helped for like 3 days, maybe... I stopped breastfeeding which was the last thing I had that I felt I was bonding with him. Now I just have aching boobs and a screaming formula fed baby. It's been weeks since I've breastfed and I kind of don't even want to try to get my supply back because it's hard...I feel like a horrible mother for not bf-ing when I feel it might be affecting his quality of life. 
I wish I could sink into a hole and be gone forever. ",

"I’m 5 months pp with my second and I’m a single mom working at minimum 40 hours a week in a factory. I’m losing it. I’m drowning. I’m so anxious all the time, my heart beats so fast and I can hardly breathe, I tried an as needed anxiety med and it did help my anxiety but made me so tired I couldn’t hardly keep up at work. It’s like my body is working overtime to produce enough energy for the day. I wake up at 4am every day for work (after being up at 1:30am and 3am to feed the baby) and don’t get home until 4pm. I’m immediately greeted by my kids who are both babes still. I love them and do everything I can to get it right. I’m falling apart. I can’t ever relax. I have nothing and no one to turn to. How do I get help? Where can I go? Because idk how much longer my nervous system can take the stress. ",
"I've been really struggling this first week and I feel like I just need someone to tell me it gets better and I won't feel broken forever...

For context, I'm 31 and this is my first baby. I've wanted to be a mom my whole life and was so, so excited while I was pregnant. Then I had our sweet girl 5 weeks early and she spent a whole month in the NICU. I thought that was going to be the hardest part, leaving our girl with strangers everyday but now that she's home it's been SO SO hard.

Since I'm off work and my husband isn't I thought I could do the nights mostly on my own and I was managing even though she was waking up every 90 mins for food and I have to pump because she won't breastfeed.
But now we're a week in and she has a stomach bug AND thrush in her mouth. She's waking up like every hour and sometimes she won't sleep unless you're holding her so my husband and I are taking 3 hours shifts so we both get some sleep (and he's taking a few hours off each day so he can catch up on sleep before work).

I love my girl more than anything but taking care of her 24/7 makes me feel like less than a person and more of a milking cow. And I don't want my husband to resent me, I don't think he does or will it's just one of those PPD thoughts - even though we agreed on one child early on in our relationship I know he didn't really want kids. What if he ends up hating me because of this? Because of all the extra work for ""no reward"" for him. I at least have moments of love and joy with her but I'm not sure he does.

Thank you for reading, it's a lot and I'm just at a loss on where to go from here and what to do. I feel like I'm failing my daughter, my husband, and myself and that's the hardest part. I also have a great support system around me that I lean on but no one's really struggled like this (that I know of) and Im just looking for a little reassurance that it does get better. That one day I'll feel like a person again, I'll get to sleep more than 30 minutes at a time, that my husband and I can be a couple again, and that I won't wish anyone else could just take my girl off my hands until it's not so dang hard...",
"My SO intentionally missed work today to spend it with the kids and I.. and I can’t help but be pissed off. I just feel so angry. I told him I feel like it was because the house is a mess, I need to do laundry, I am running on 4-5 in-consecutive hours of sleep, the baby is teething, my stepdaughter has a mess in the living room. And he woke up to make us breakfast and I was pissed because he was going to leave the kitchen even more dirty. Why do I feel this way? Why can’t I be happy? He said he’s so fed up with me and left.

"Has anyone been hospitalised in a (mbu) mother and baby unit before? 

I (23f) and my second baby a newborn (7wks) have been offered a place at a inpatient mother and baby psychiatric unit after I attempted to take my own life a few weeks ago, and suffering from intrusive thoughts and low mood since the birth of my baby. Aswell as suffering from other mental illnesses pre pregnancy. 

I’m looking for some insight into what daily life and support looked like at the mbu. 
I’m nervous about leaving home but hoping it’ll only benefit me as I have nothing to loose going forward  

If anyone can share their experiences I’d really appreciate it. ",
"I’m almost 24 weeks postpartum and just really started feeling the ppd over the last month or so. I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 12 and started medicating at 17. Right after birth, I felt good. I wasn’t depressed or anything. But lately it’s just gotten worse than ever. It’s manifesting as rage. Today I told my husband I want a divorce because he and our child would be better off without me. He told me no and that I would be finding a therapist today. 

I love him and I don’t want our marriage to be over and I want to be a mom to our daughter but I grew up in a house with an angry parent. I don’t want that for her. Part of me wants to demand the divorce for his and her safety and wellbeing. Idk what to do anymore. I’m lost. I feel like I’m spiraling. ",
"I’m 4 months PP and I’m still feeling this way. I lost my entire identity and am searching for a new one within motherhood. I crave what I had before the freedom, the time, the life in general. I fantasize about what could’ve been. What I could’ve been doing, where I could’ve been, the dreams I put on a shelf to be a mom. I love my baby with every fiber in my being and if I could go back I wouldn’t change a thing. But is that actually true? If it was true why do I hate my life so much… I also hate my man I feel like I’m always fighting with him and I can’t tell if it’s my bad attitude or just him. I feel like our relationship has changed so much and I know that’s normal I’m just having a hard time with it. Will our flame rekindle or is it out and we should give up? I’m so lost with everything and I feel like every free time I do get I’m worrying about the baby. Is she developing right, am I playing with her enough, am I doing all the right things, do I give her enough baths, what is she going to be like when she’s older, am I a good mom. So even when I do have time to just do my thing I can’t. Always in a constant state of stress that I resent my man for not feeling for some reason. I thought I wasn’t going to suffer from PPD but the few I have talked to says it seems like I am. Is there light at the end of the tunnel or will I always feel empty? And let’s not even begin on the unrecognizable face and body I see in the mirror everyday.

"Hey all! A few months ago I had posted here asking if anyone had any experiences with Zurzuvae. I had previously had PPD with my first baby and just had my second baby 3 weeks ago with an 18 month age gap. I also had no prior history of depression before getting PPD. I wanted to share my experience since it’s a fairly new drug and there wasn’t a whole lot of info out there when I started looking into it.

I was able to get a prior authorization from my insurance to cover the Zurzuvae so I did have the actual prescription filled before I gave birth and only paid a $5 copay. If I didn’t have insurance it would’ve been upwards of $20,000. I started taking it the day I came home from the hospital (less than 48 hours after giving birth).

Overall I immediately felt better after giving birth the second time than the first time around. Deliveries were both vaginal and generally pretty easy (including postpartum recovery). With my first the hormone drop was IMMEDIATE and I remember feeling weepy/sad literally the second she came out. This time around, even without taking the Zurzuvae yet, I felt way better and really experienced that “newborn bliss” everyone talks about. I’m 3 weeks pp and still feeling completely normal aside from a couple of random crying episodes (but honestly I attribute it to normal postpartum hormonal changes because they were so minor).

While taking the Zurzuvae I didn’t experience any of the side effects people talked about on this sub- especially the tiredness. The only tiredness I really felt was normal newborn tired. I never really worried about the “eat something really fatty before taking” and aside from a little dizziness here and there had no side effects whatsoever.

It’s hard to know for sure if the Zurzuvae kept the PPD away or if I just got lucky with the hormonal balance this time around, but either way if you can take it I’d recommend it- my personal opinion is that it won’t hurt to try!

Also last thing to note- throughout my pregnancy and even now through postpartum I took/am taking a few vitamin supplements on top of my prenatals— iron, B6, D3. I started taking the B6 and D3 around 24 weeks pregnant and the iron around 32ish weeks pregnant. I’ve continued to take these postpartum and will continue to do so for 6 months (it took around 6 months for me to battle through the PPD last time). Obviously talk to your medical professional but I have a sneaking suspicion these supplements actually helped me keep the PPD at bay this time around. I’m not a doctor, this is purely an uneducated gut feeling �

tldr Took Zurzuvae immediately after birth of my 2nd; no side effects and no PPD 3wks pp. Unsure if it was the Zurzuvae that helped or I just got lucky this time around.",
Becoz of lack of sleep at night and baby waking up alot and crying makes me so angry. I am scared of hurting my little angel �,
"Few weeks ago after DCF was investigating my family, a detective called and told me I have to come and talk to him or get an attorney to speak with him. I told him I'm definitely not speaking with him but will try and find someone to talk to him. Obviously that was a fail and not many attorneys got back to me. I was in the middle of moving so I also kind of forgot about it especially because I was moving along with DCF and doing visitations etc with my sons. He called again today and said because I didn't get someone to speak with him he had to move on with his ""investigation"" and he sent it to the prosecutor. Now I am being charged with 2 counts risk of injury to a minor and 2 counts assault third degree. This is all due to unexplained markings to my twins during a postpartum depression/psychosis episode.

I’m hoping to get these charges dropped but I am devastated. No prior record, I worked as a toddler teacher for 6 years, no issues and then I fell pregnant. I was also a part time nanny and then my sons were born premature. I had lost my job because my leave ran out and my sons were only 4 lbs when they came home. But one was medically complex so I devoted my time and savings to be at home. I am also a single parent. DCF was already involved before the detective stepped in. My plan with DCF is reunification and my mom has temporary physical custody of my boys. They asked me about my mental health one time after my sons were born and that was that. The detective when he called suggested I come in today to “turn myself in”. He stated the judge granted my bond PTA, as in “promise to appear”. So, he claims, as long as I show up to fingerprint and mugshot etc, and then show up to court I shouldn’t have issues with bond. Over the phone he made it seem like the judge was being too nice given the charges. It hurt, because he is a man and I don’t expect him to understand the severity of this mental illness. I’m hoping the judge shows more compassion when I’m actually in court. I plan on getting a court appointed attorney as well. Notes: When my sons were getting evaluated by the hospital, I checked myself in the hospital voluntarily because I was afraid that I did do something without the knowledge. I am now on two different medications and have been actively seeing the psychiatrist, I saw my therapist since my sons were in the NICU. My sons have had regular doctors appointments sometimes twice a week others once every week since they got home. They have seen every mandated reporter since they were born, and there has been no worries up until their physical therapist called at their daycare session early January. They also attend daycare regularly unless they have their 5 million doctors visits. Unfortunately My memory of the incident is consistent with postpartum-related dissociation and/or severe depression symptoms. At first I was angry at being accused but now I feel like I'm glad it happened because I would've never known. Any advice or just words of encouragement is appreciated.",
"I don’t know where I can vent so posting this here….I had a baby 15wks ago. I feel such rage when I see my spouse, I feel he is a man-child who was treated like a princess by his mom. He doesn’t do a single task unless it is explained in detail, it’s my fault if I don’t explain it and if I start explaining I’m talking too much….i feel like I’m the only adult stuck with a baby and a young adult (he is 4 years older than me) where I have to cook, clean, do laundry. 
He procrastinates chores and I have started helping with chore after I’m back from hospital as he was having man-flu for a few days…luckily I had my family to help me during my recovery….now that they have gone back to their lives in different countries, I feel all by myself in this….all he does is hold the baby and sit in front of the tv and when I ask him why he didn’t do a chore he sites the baby as a reason, He is so obsessed with his gaming and tv (anything on tv can keep the man captivated)…I have noticed lately he has become very loud and intolerant and acts like I’m over reacting…my patience and tolerance too has limits, I get tired trying to explain or simplify tasks/chores. 
sometimes I actually question myself if its me…I don’t know if I’m passive aggressive or if he is! Or if he is gas lighting me..
I can’t seek counselling or help as I understood during my initial chat with the maternity nurse about anxiety of being home with a one week old baby she panicked and said I should see a counsellor… if I discuss this they will tear my family apart and make a mountain out of a mole…I wonder what if all these loud arguments are impacting the baby’s mental health..that worries me a lot! And after all the argument he gives me silent treatment or make me feel guilty. I have a feeling he is documenting all this in case he needs to prove that I’m the aggressor, whereas i don’t have anything to support my claims…How do I deal with this? ",
"please don’t judge.. i’m genuinely terrified.. i don’t get help with my 6 month old.. i’ve barely slept the past month and i find myself getting mad at my baby easily and getting to rough with her.. i love her with all my heart but i’m so scared that i might hurt her.. to the point where i really don’t think i’m good for her.. i need help, advice, anything really..",
"I know being at daycare (he’s almost 6 months now, been there for not even 2 full months), he’s going to get sick but it’s just been nonstop. He’s already had 2 ear infections, Covid, an eye infection, and he just woke up with a gross crusty eye at 1 am. He literally stopped eye drops Sunday & oral antibiotics Monday….  It’s FRIDAY! I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown lol. His sleep is (understandably) terrible while he’s sick so we’re getting maybe 3-5 good nights of sleep a month at this point. Now I’m sitting here crying because I’m pretty sure we’re down the path of another horrible few weeks of antibiotics and wake ups. I JUST started feeling like a human and had a few really good days and now I feel like the rug is being ripped out from under me. Work is so hard and now I’ll be trying to manage with him home tomorrow, plus the inevitable doctors appointment for whatever he has going on AGAIN. ",
"I’m 10 weeks postpartum with my 4th baby. Already on Prozac , Buspar and Adderall. I’ve been on Prozac since I was 19, Buspar for 3 years and Adderall I just started back up after being off of it during pregnancy. I’m seeing a therapist who specializes in postpartum mental health, and ADHD. Based on everything I’ve talked to her about, how I’ve been feeling, things that have happened ( Lots and lots of postpartum rage, intense mood swings, intrusive thoughts) she thinks adding in a very low dose mood stabilizer to help with my emotions / mood swings would be really beneficial for the short term while I’m in this postpartum phase. She explained higher doses is what they use to treat bipolar or psychosis, which is not the case for myself. 

Anybody else? ",
"So 2 kids 4/1.5 I like to say I’m a pretty good husband I don’t got get a 10/10 all the time but god knows I am trying my ass off. Me and wife share household chores I help with kids a lot all I do is work and do husband dad stuff. But my wife is so damn cold towards me I can’t get a kiss or a hug unless I do it and sex maybe once a month . I’m starting to feel she just flat out hates me. Im willing to do whatever she needs I’ve told her this and ask is there anything I can do and the answer I get is I don’t know.My question is this something that will pass or is this my new normal marriage. Sexless, no emotions from her cold heart? ",
"My oldest is 14 months and I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant with #2. I was on Lexapro through my whole first pregnancy for baseline anxiety and depression and then doubled my dosage after I gave birth and was subsequently and unshockingly diagnosed with PPD. 

About 3 months ago I moved states, and lost my psychiatrist, so lost my Lexapro. We had talked about me trial-ing being off so I figured might as well do it now. 

I was doing so well. I was feeling strong, I had the tools I needed, I was happy, then I got pregnant. 

Now I feel miserable. It's like my old self has reared her ugly head back in. I'm hopeless, I'm anxious, I'm sad. I know my hormones are wild right now, but I don't feel like I can do this for another 7 months, but going back on meds when I was doing SO WELL off of them feels like a failure, for me and my peanut. 

This sucks. I don't even know if I can find a new psychiatrist since I assume most of them are going to give me the ""dangers of ssris in pregnancy"" spiel. Has anyone had success getting mental health prescriptions from their OB? 

Life was so good and now I'm so sad.  


Edit: Thank you all so much for your kindness and reassurances. I wrote this and then promptly cried myself to sleep. This morning I woke up and read all your kind words, and then reached out to my OB to ask about getting back on Lexapro. ",

"The left side is me at 6 weeks pregnant and the right are both 16 weeks postpartum. I am struggling to fall in love with my body again. I was a personal trainer with body fat percentage always under 20%. I used to suffer from anorexia as a teen, so fitness really helped me take care of my body and be at a healthy weight I could be happy seeing myself at. I love my baby more than I can put into words, but every single day I look at myself and cry. As a personal trainer, I have always helped women in my situation, but I can’t seem to help myself. I know I need to give my body time. 
Seeing mothers who gave birth naturally makes me jealous as silly as that is. I had an emergency c section to save my baby and my own life. It was traumatic and recovery started off very rough. My mind keeps telling me I have basically failed as a mother because i couldn’t birth my baby naturally, and seeing the state of my body and the scar remind me everyday. I am struggling to massage the scar area as well because I can’t stand the way my stomach feels and the way the nerves in the area feel. I use a handheld lymphatic massager because touching my skin in the area or scar immediately make me lose it..
My healthcare provider has told me I do not have postpartum depression, I have tried to get help. 
I really hope someone has some tips on how they have dealt with a similar situation.",
"I feel like I’ve totally lost myself and I am so paralyzed with what to do. 2 under 2. On meds and therapy - had bad ppd with the first and it’s  coming back despite going to therapy every single week since I found out I was unexpectedly pregnant 14 months pp and on medication. Currently 3 months pp with #2 and honestly nothing brings me joy. I’m not sleeping now this week. I have lost total interest in my career and have no idea what I want to do. I’ve been a practitioner in medicine for 10 years and have zero interest in returning… I know I need to stop BFing because I hate it but I feel so crummy about having to give my baby essentially cows milk…. I hate the state we live in - I had so much disappointment last year with so many failed interviews and having to sell our house because I lost my FT job a year ago…. I honestly have so much help and feel like such a pathetic person for feeling this way - everyone else judges me and basically feels like “I have way more help than other people and my kids are so good….” (Sisters attitude after her visit this past weekend…) 

How do I become unstuck :/ I try walks and peloton, try to reach out to moms or mom groups and nothing is helping at all 

My poor babies Im just wasting away this precious time with them when they’re young but the truth is I hate it - I hate that I can’t get a minute alone or even a mental minute alone if I try to leave the house I still can’t stop thinking about them - thanks for listening - maybe someone in the universe will hear my cry and can relate �",
"I’m 8 weeks PP and a FTM. I’ve done fairly good when it comes to PPD but it has started to sneak up on me some the past two weeks. Being stuck at home 24/7 alone with the baby is catching up to me. Don’t get me wrong, I am SO happy to be home with my baby but it’s not easy. I’ve worked since the moment I could drive and have never relied on anyone. I’ve always been super independent. My fiancé is amazing and very supportive, but somethings he gets to do I don’t find very fair. He works two jobs M-F 8am-11pm sometimes earlier sometimes later. His second job is where we met. We were coworkers. A lot of our friends are coworkers from that job. On occasion he calls me and tells me he is going out for drinks with them. I understand he needs time too and I know he should be able to do that without me getting upset. But damn it’s not fair that I can’t just say “going out for drinks be home soon”. I can’t even go to the freaking grocery store when I want because we only have one car right now. So when I say I’m home all week alone. I mean it. No trips to target. Nothing. I don’t want to be the nagging partner but I can’t wait for him to get home in the evenings so I can have someone to talk to. It hurts my feelings so bad when he calls to tell me he is staying out later to hangout with them. He works hard and he deserves time to relax but so do i. Now I’m sitting here, baby is asleep. And I’m completely alone having to wait two extra hours until he gets home. AITA??? How can I stop feeling so upset about this? It’s not like he does it very often. ",

"Has anyone taken progesterone (shots,oral,suppository,etc) for PPA, PPOCD, PPD. I’ve had anxiety/OCD my whole life and noticed it was triggered a lot more during puberty for me (leaving me to assume my issues are often hormonally charged). Was curious if anyone had an experience to share?

I’m 2 weeks post TMFR at 28 weeks due to lethal fetal diagnosis.
The first week is very heavy and feel very heart broken and now the past few days I feel okay but I feel deep hollow sadness, no sense of purpose, doesn’t have any appetite, very irritable, lazy and I sleep mostly during the day and usually sleep 3am or 4am. I don’t want to talk to people nor to family or friends. I feel shell of a person. I don’t have energy but I do the bare minimum at home and make my kids eat on time.

My husband is not saying anything nor even asking if I’m okay. I feel so alone.

The feeling resemble my postpartum experience on my eldest child(LC). It was covid and had postpartum blues 2weeks and felt so isolated.

I think I have PPD but not sure if it’s part or grief or both.",
"I’m struggling with really intense fears revolving around my baby getting hurt and passing. My husband and I experienced some steep lows before successfully conceiving - I still couldn’t believe I was pregnant until he was placed on my belly. And even then, he was immediately whisked away for care and a (thankfully) brief stay in the NICU. The room was swarmed with medical staff for him and my husband stuck with him, and while it turned out okay, I felt so devastated thinking we wouldn’t ever get to bring him home. 

I’m terrified to let my dog anywhere near him - we use a gate to separate them but I keep having intense visions of him jumping it and biting off his little leg. My dog has not shown aggression, is never alone or close to him, and likes babies, so I understand this is irrational. SIDS is also a concern of mine and I’m finding it hard to sleep (when I briefly can). Or when I walk through doorways holding my baby I’m convinced I’m going to accidentally hit his head on the frame and kill him so I walk through sideways with my hand on his head. The list goes on. 

My care team keeps assuring me this is normal and will pass. I am able to openly talk about it and increased my lexapro dosage. My husband is being very empathetic and supportive, we’ve started “shifts” to help me rest. But it still feels very overwhelming, like my brain is turning on me. Every single thing, no matter how mundane, is scary. ",
I hate my life. I feel like crashing out. I just had a baby and it’s been rough to say the least.,
"It’s been 1 yr and I’m still a mess. I just wish I could disappear. And I wish that my husband would find someone else to love. I’m just a place filler until he does. We are not compatible any more. He came home from Bible study last night and was excited because of the intellectual conversations they were having. I wasn’t there but I know I would not be able to discuss the different theologies with him or the group. 
My son will be going away for flight school. I offered to go with him as a minivacation but I would not be able to help him find an apartment, buy a car, fill out paper work for school bc I don’t know how. I haven’t done any of that for myself.  

I dropped off kids at school And my daughter rudely asked me to switch over her laundry. Bc that’s what I am. The maid, the housewife. I just do things and am not a person. 

I wish my husband could understand how much I don’t want to be here. ",
"Is anyone else completely repulsed by anything remotely sexual in nature? I have zero libido, and my husband and I haven’t made love since way before the baby was born (4 months ago) and even when I see something relating to sex on tv or social media i recoil. Like I have a full body reaction to it like my skin is crawling and I want to be sick. 

Is this hormonal? Will it go away? ",
"I feel broken, I'm just a fraction of who I was, and I don't know if I will ever get myself back. With every cry that this baby makes, it makes me want to bash my head into a wall. I'm nothing but a servant to this tiny human, I must feed him, change him, and hold him. If I don't, he starts crying. God forbid I try to take care of myself, I can barely eat or shower right now. I'm depressed and I tried to talk to my husband last night about it but it didn't do me any good really. He doesn't get it, I lost myself again, and every day, I have to care for the newborn. I feel like I'm going insane. I just want to scream 

Edit: So we had an argument, and I think I'm just going to shut up. I'm not going to talk about my feelings anymore because obviously they don't matter. It doesn't matter if I need a break. I'm a mom , and I gave up my right to breaks when I had kids. At least according to everyone in my life, including my husband. And yes, he said the exact words they would use, all because he won't walk on eggshells, and I need to hear the truth, apparently. It's not like I'm having a breakdown and trying to express my thoughts to him. He just won't listen anymore. I feel like a shit human being because I thought I was able to handle this, but getting back home has told me another. It's all my fault ",
"I just need advice really or just to rant i don’t know… It started when i was in my 3rd trimester, i didn’t want my man to touch me AT ALL. Fast forward to now, im a year post partum and my hormones are still messed up. I feel like the worst girlfriend ever. I’m never in the mood for anything sexual, i get aggravated when he asks. I’m ALWAYS overstimulated. Of course i still have sex with him mostly anytime he asks but the problem is i don’t want to. i don’t know why, during it, i feel great! totally normal. But getting into the mood is the problem. I never get that feeling i used to get. I used to be so crazy with him and now i just am the complete opposite and i try to explain it to him but he just takes it as “rejection” or me not “finding him attractive” Which 100% isn’t it. I should probably go to the doctor but i feel like they’re just gonna tell me it’s stress and i don’t need to hear that. Something is wrong i don’t feel normal anymore. I sorta talked to my mom about it and she asked if i thought it could be from past sexual trauma which i guess it could be.. but ive blocked out so much of my past it’s blurry. Maybe its time for a therapist �",
So I’m currently 7 months pp and I feel so alone in this new parenting journey. My husband doesn’t help me with the baby. I have to constantly ask him “can you change his diapers” or “can you watch him so I can shower or eat”. We’ve already had a conversation about this. Hes told me that he feels like he doesn’t help me as much as he should. I basically told him that he needs to see what works best for him but he can’t find it if he doesn’t take that first step. Sad to say he still hasn’t changed. Another thing is that my baby is now a Velcro baby. He always wants to be with me so I can’t really have any alone time to myself or I have to eat fast or shower fast. Since I’m a SAHM I’m just at home all day. The longest I stayed in the house was for 6 consecutive days and I only went out to grocery store to buy vegetables for my baby’s purées. I barely talk to my friends or see them since we live an hour away from them now. As well as my family. So I had considered my husband as my only friend that I can talk to at the moment. When he comes home from work I sometimes try to do something to bring entertainment to my life or just spend quality time with him. I asked him if I can show him a movie I really enjoyed cause I want to be able to talk to someone about it. He wasn’t too thrilled but finally agreed after I begged him. Only for him to fall asleep in the first 10 min. I just told him “it’s fine we can watch it another time…you can take your nap you’re tired” and he keeps telling me that he’ll watch it but I said it’s no use if he’s just gonna fall asleep. So he proceeds to do so. He napped for about and hour and a half…and I tended to the baby. Don’t know when he’ll actually watch cause he’s always tired. Another thing I tried to talk to him about was about the drake and Kendrick beef. I finally looked into it and I wanted to show my husband and yes it’s not important but it’s just entertainment. I wanted someone to talk about it with. He wasn’t interested. I got mad telling him I always listen to his story’s even though it’s about the most pathetic thing but I listen and I engage and I ask questions because I want to talk to my husband but he wouldn’t do the same for me. After a while he said sorry…but that’s it…I didn’t say anything. I put the baby to sleep and he gets on his PC to play. I can’t sleep at this point cause I’m so upset and I just give him one worded answers when he goes to sleep. Now I’m here crying at 2am while he and my baby are sound asleep. And once again I’m alone. Tbh the reason I wanted to post this isn’t to get advice. I just needed to rant and someone to read and listen. ,
Hey all. I have been doing IFS therapy and I recently brought healing to a part who felt sacrificed when delivering my baby 7 years ago. This is the image I drew after that therapy session. ,
"Did your postpartum depression include Anhedonia (the inability to enjoy things you once enjoyed) and emotional numbness? I can't feel the nice feeling of a hug or endorphins after a workout.. it happened to me a month after giving birth. It's so odd and i'm scared i'm stuck like this forever. Did you take any medication for this, if so what meds?",
"The thought I circle a lot is that I wish I could d
erase myself from my husband/son’s memories and leave them with a better mom/wife who’s more patient and happy, etc. 

Last night was a really tough night. 5 month old has been sick pretty consistently from general daycare germs and he’s been up a lot the past few days. My husband and I rotate taking the night shift for a few days in a row just based on work needs. I had Thursday and last night. Last night was particularly difficult for me, reaching the point where my husband woke up at 3 AM to me pretty hysterical. It was just really bad through this morning. 

Tonight was like a punch in the gut when I went to take my son for the night shift again, like I do every Saturday and my husband said he’s not comfortable with me taking the baby. It’s not a fear that I’ll hurt him, but he just looked disturbed by how frustrated and upset I was last night, and rightfully so. I’m disgusted with myself. I feel like I’m ruining all of our memories. His first Valentine’s Day closed with me being a complete depression monster. I did the same thing on Christmas. 

I know my husband doesn’t understand the magnitude of how I’m feeling even though I’ve tried talking to him. I can’t get motivated to figure out therapy. No one else in my life really knows what’s going on. I just feel so ugly. I wish I could give them the wife/mom they deserve and not whatever I am. ",
"I’m a single mom with a 10 week old and a 4 year old. Lately at night when I’m trying to get the baby settled, the 4 year old suddenly has all the energy in the world and I want her to settle down. We play hide and seek, read a book, she definitely is not lacking attention. But when she is settled and I’m getting the baby ready for bed having the baby on me, and the 4 year old having to be touching me in some form… 

I’m just raging for some reason. No other time do I mind both them on me, I don’t mind hugs kisses snuggling any other time but just the end of day is so much. I feel so sad inside that I can’t deal with both my kids touching me at the same time (I do obviously). 

Anyone else :( ",
"I am 10 weeks postpartum with my second baby and I’m just having a really sad and anxious day. I think part of it is sleep deprivation and maybe my period. I’m on 20mg of Prozac and 150mg of Wellbutrin and I just have this homesick and sad feeling, like I’m longing for comfort I’ll never get. I feel alone even though I have a husband who helps. I am so sick of feeling this way and just want it to get better. ",
I am having a very difficult time. Motherhood has been wearing away at me and I feel as if I can't go on any longer. I'm having intense mood swings from deep sadness to deep rage. I screamed at my 13 month old this morning and feel like an utter failure. I called my husband "useless." I feel like a horrible person. I called my pharmacy to refill a Zoloft prescription I have. I was on it for maybe less than 2 months and stopped it out of fear of dependency and what it could be doing to my son who breastfeeds. I feel desperate now so I'm contemplating taking it but scared I'm going down another dark path of medication.  ,
Is it better to end it all and kill myself while my children and too young to understand or to keep fuxking everything up for the rest of ny life and make everyone miserable? I can't do this anymore. ,
"Mom looking for a purpose

I am a mom to two beautiful babies, and I love them so much but I feel so lost. I feel like I’m not even here/not present with my children. I put them first always and cater to their needs but when I look back at photos I feel like I don’t even remember those things happening or like I was a different person 6mths ago, a year ago, 2yrs ago. Every day I feel like I’m doing something wrong and I’m terrified to screw them up. Even when it comes to my career decisions I struggle to make decisions because I want to be a role model for my two girls and want them to be proud of what their mom does. Will they be proud of me for staying home with them or should I grind through more schooling to pursue my career goals? I am constantly weighing my options for everything from my career, their wellbeing and schooling, groceries, renovations, cars, trips etc to decide what is most economical, efficient and benefits the kids the most and I never prioritize myself. I have always been depressed and still get lost in that at times but this feels so much more than the ebbs and flows of my usual depressive episodes, this is a constant aching of feeling a lack of purpose but then a profound guilt that I shouldn’t feel that way because my kids and motherhood IS my purpose. Gahh, I just feel so lost and trapped and like I don’t know what the hell I truly want and I wish I could escape but I could never do that to my kids, so I just lull through each day and feel stuck. 
Sorry for the ramble but does anyone else feel this way? Is it normal and I’m just being dramatic or is there something wrong with me? How can I work on this? ",
"When people text you to check in and ask you how you’re doing do they want the real answer ? 
I just wrote out a response to a friend who asked how I’ve been doing (she knows I have ppd) and I don’t know whether to hit send or she just wants me to say I’m alright … ",
"I'll start with a little background for context. I have always dealt with some degree of anxiety (and perhaps depression) for years, often leading to bouts of insomnia before getting pregnant. The longest it would last would be maybe a month and simply just having difficulty getting to sleep. I had one week or two of insomnia while pregnant, but honestly was less anxious than usual. Flash forward to now, I'm 5 months pp and have been struggling to get a good nights rest for nearly 3 months, and (at least for the last 2 months) it's not the baby.



The first 10-12 weeks, yeah the baby made it difficult to get good rest. He was colicky and breastfeeding was going poorly. I transitioned to being an exclusive pumper and the schedule I was having to keep to try to increase my poor supply only served to mess with my sleep even more. I'd sleep fairly good for the first half of the night, but got to where when I woke up to pump in the middle of the night, I struggled to get back to sleep. I dropped the middle of the night pump early January and had initial improvement in my sleep. I'd still wake up before my alarm, only getting 1-2 hours more than I had been. Then I started having trouble getting to sleep and still waking up early. I started feeling anxious just looking at my bed. So I moved to the couch and it worked... for a bit. Then was the day I went 40 hours without sleep... I was in crisis mode and my primary doctor basically said ""sorry, can't help. Nothing we can prescribe you because you're breastfeeding."" Thankfully, my OB was able to see me and questioned if I'm depressed/anxious because I'm not sleeping or not sleeping because I'm depressed/anxious. Honestly, I don't know which came first at this point. 

  
She prescribed me Trazadone to help me sleep. And it did help. So did weaning from pumping. But my old friend insomnia still seems to be sticking around. If I don't take the Trazadone, it takes me forever to get to sleep and I still wake up early. I've been sick recently, so I've even paired it with NyQuil a few nights, which seems more effective but still not getting a full night of rest (NyQuil used to leave me drowsy the next day... apparently not anymore). Last night took me forever to get to sleep and I only slept maybe 4 hours before being woken by my husband's coughing. I just feel at a loss of what to do. I miss sleeping in bed, but just seeing it makes me anxious. The couch is making my body hurt and honestly probably contributing to my poor sleep at this point. I'm anxious about feeling like I NEED something to get to sleep rather than falling asleep like I used to, and my prescription is almost out. 

  
Not looking for medical advice, but hoping to hear if anyone has or is going through something similar right now. Has anything helped you to get back a semblance of normalcy? I'm scheduled to start therapy next Wednesday, but want to see if there is anything I can try in the meantime. ",
"So i need to get these thoughts off my chest. My baby is now 7 months and I feel I'm slowly coming out of the fog... but looking back i can't help but come to terms with how irresponsible I was while pregnant i flat out sabotaged my career/reputation/ finances last year...

 Im self employed,  and have always taken pride in my clients care... but while pregnant I did a few major things wrong... the biggest one i never told my clients I was pregnant, for fear of losing business... but in the end I did lose. I messed up on many significant details during transactions that cost my clients money and time. I 100% hate myself for this. 

The other is due to delivering such poor care,  i had a BAD year financially like bringing in less than $5000 bad... thank goodness for my husband having a good stable job but this put our family in a HUGE bind because right before I found out I was pregnant I made a pretty large purchase from a person/ company that I had great dealings with before and he trusted me in good faith, I had intentions of it being covered and paid for within a month of receiving.... well a week after that is when I got the news (very unexpected) and shit hit the fan... making it impossible to cover and pay for...i ultimately kind of forgot about it until this past January when a sheriff showed up with judgment papers �� naming myself AND husband...he had zero part in what i did and his job is at risk now that he's roped into this...i again hate myself for all this turmoil and loss of trust from my husband as well as the company i always used and supported... but in my nature to do ANY of the above i don't want to blame the pregnancy but it sure feels like it had a major effect on my overall thinking and performance. 

There's nothing I can do about this besides learn from my mistakes and ask for forgiveness, it's in process of being paid off.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for besides getting thoughts out in the open",

It was been very difficult and im pretty sure I'm really depressed. I'm lost and in despair and can not handle the volatility.

Recently she was telling she loved me and she needed some time to focus on her self mentally, emotionally & physically.

I take my baby 4 to 5 days a week as that's the arranged schedule. 

I try to support her as much as can with the terms I've been given. She allows me to do bed time routine every Tuesday & some times Thursday. 

Her moods have been so volatile and seems like my presence is just hated. She's one day reasonable and then the next just absolutely cold recluse and mean.

I'm starting to now getting thoughts of wanting to commit suicide my self because I'm afraid my life with my child will be nothing but conflict and hate. 

I'm really depressed and I try to turn to prayer when I start to spiral but I'm at my wits end. I dont know how much longer I can take of this. I'm don't wanna to end my life and leave my daughter fatherless. 

But im not in a good place mentally and I'm trying to work on my self but I feel when I have bad days it's really bad. I see a therapist it helps but with the constant interaction with my baby's momma I'm beginning to degrade and I have terrible anxiety. I shake un controllably when I have to face her face to face. 

I'm really in a bad place. I dont know what to do any more. This constant pain and the outlook of being a single father has destroyed my peace and I really want to end my life. 

I've never been this down in my life... and I feel it's a life sentence and I don't want my life to be like this for the rest of my life.",
"My LO was born 7 weeks early and had to stay in the NICU for over a month. He's 6m now, but I feel if I disappeared my baby wouldn't suffer.

"I wanted to add my story for any mom out there who might be struggling with postpartum anxiety/depression and who is on the fence about whether or not to take Zurzuvae. I had the box in my closet for almost two months before finally deciding to start the medication, and now that I'm seeing the benefits, I wish I had taken it sooner. I am taking it at 7 months postpartum. 

One thing that kept me from starting earlier was the UTI side effect. I hate UTI's, and the thought of dealing with that on top of everything was overwhelming. The first day after I started taking the meds, I bought AZO and cranberry tablets and that helped me feel a bit more in control as I started the treatment. Sometimes, just feeling like I'm doing something proactive helps a lot. 

Background: I have struggled with postpartum anxiety since having my first child in 2020, but with this, my third postpartum, there were also definite clouds of depression. I have used the word ""hopeless"" a few times to describe my feelings to loved ones and my doctor, and that's how I knew that depression was in play. My doctor didn't hesitate to diagnose my PPD and to order the prescription for Zurzuvae, saying that it had been a ""miracle"" drug for the patients she had prescribed it for. I received the medication about two weeks later, and then I put it in my closet while I debated whether or not I wanted to take it. It was probably the PPA and PPD at the wheel because it was hard for me to overcome my sense of impending doom. Three days ago, I had a conversation with my sister and through tears, I finally knew it was time to give it a try. I was tired of not being emotionally available for my kids, the baby as well as the older two. I took my first dose at 8pm and then went to bed.

Day 1: Thankfully, my husband handles night feeding because I was so drowsy, I could barely walk straight when my older kid woke me up around 4:00 in the morning needing help getting back to sleep. It felt like I was drunk. I went back to bed and by 6:30, I was still very drowsy, but I was able to function enough for my family's morning hustle. I was able to drive my kid to school at 8:30 and I could function at work, but I felt buzzed or hungover for most of the day. I didn't feel any benefits on day 1. In fact, the drowsiness made things feel much worse. My head started clearing just as it was time to take my second dose, which I took at 6pm with hopes my head would clear sooner the next day.

Day 2: This was a dark day for me. I was able to function in the morning, avoiding driving until 10:00. I still felt buzzed, muddled, unfocused, and drowsy all day, but I also felt really down. Had I not decided to give it at least three days, I might have stopped taking the meds after this day. I was weepy, low energy, and just not quite there. I felt like I was doing a horrible job at work and at home. Hoping that the research would hold true for me, I took the third dose at 6pm. The drowsiness had been taking about 4 hours to hit me, so I was able to do bedtime and cleanup without any issues.

Day 3: I woke up feeling drowsy but...hopeful! The weather was awful and my kids were home for a snow day, but I was actually feeling, dare I say, happy. Other women describe it as feeling like a cloud has been lifted, and I can see that. I felt more at ease, less irritable, and just more present with my family and with my work today. I still felt a little muddled mentally, but I was definitely feeling the benefits of the medication and I did not hesitate to take that evening's dose. I took it at 6pm with dinner and two tablespoons of peanut butter, which has worked well for me. I slept well and hard.

Day 4: I was a bit groggy when I woke up, and I didn't feel the same ""high"" as the day before, but I'm not as groggy and dark as I was the first two days of taking the medication. I still felt irritable and short tempered, but I was not weepy or as down as I had been before. I was able to focus a bit better on this day. I noticed throughout the day moments that would have made me ""rage"" in the past but were just mildly annoying. I also experienced some benefits later in the day while prepping dinner for a group. We had somewhere to be, but instead of feeling tightly wound and anxious, I was able to tackle meal prep in a more relaxed way. It feels like the anxiety is being smoothed if that makes sense. I took my dose at 6pm this evening with two tablespoons of peanut butter, but I waited a bit to each dinner. I felt the meds hit hard without a meal in my stomach. I felt drunk and woozy. Once I got food in my stomach, I started equalizing.

Day 5: I woke up without feeling groggy and the day felt fine. I found that I was able to laugh and smile a bit easier, like I'm getting to some sort of equilibrium. I felt less groggy today and more like my old self. I was able to focus better at work, as well.

Days 6-14: I was definitely feeling less groggy in the mornings. Smiling and laughing came easier, and I was feeling more focused at work, which was a huge improvement. I guess I just felt ""normal"", but in a good way. My stomach felt a little ""off"" and I have had some congestion, but it's been very minor and maybe unrelated to taking the drug. I push all these days together because, at this point, the side effects had largely subsided. By the time I was in the second week, I was sleeping really well at night, and the grogginess in the morning was wearing off pretty quickly. Overall, I have felt more balanced after taking the meds. I still have some anxiety, some sadness, some grey days, but I feel like my low point has been reset. I have felt more hopeful, optimistic, and better able to let anxious thoughts go since taking the medicine. I feel more connected to my kids and better able to see the bright side of things.

If you are on the fence, just take it! I didn't know if my condition was ""bad"" enough to warrant the drugs, but I can see now that anything helpful is worth doing. I don't think I believed I really had PPD, but now that the clouds have cleared, I can see there was definite biological causes for my difficulties. I am now about a month out, and I'm still feeling the positive effects, so it was 100% worth it for me. The drawbacks were negligible, and the benefits have been remarkable. ",
"Not exactly PPD but definitely not helping it. I’m at my wits end with my 6 month old and napping. He will sleep all night in his crib, and will nap in the afternoons in there without much fight. But the mornings… naps in the mornings are a full blown BATTLE. He normally takes a 30ish minute nap in the morning, an hour nap around 12-1, and about an hour and a half around 3:30. He will not take his first nap in his crib and I don’t know why or what to do. Our routine is the exact same every time. He shows tired cues but I’m wondering if it’s time to drop the first nap or what. He will take a short nap if it’s a contact nap or if he’s in the pack and play. I just really don’t know what to do please help. ",
"I'm 3 weeks postpartum and I have been crying almost everyday for the past 5 days. The reason, my baby is breastfeeding and he eats alot, like every hour and a half. I'm feeling like I'm nothing more than a walking milk maker for this baby, and I know is just because I'm having some depression and my hormones aren't helping in this case. I've talked woth my husband and he says I'm doing great, the doctor says I'm doing great since baby's already gained a full pound, but I can't help but feel like I'm doi g everything wrong. I can't pick up my toddler and it's killing me, I want some time with him but he won't sit down with me or give me hugs. That's what hurts the most � I know he's just having a difficult time adjusting... I really just don't know what's happening in my head anymore it's all too much. I can't ask my family for help because they will just tell me ""Well you should have thought of that before you had another"" and I did, but that doesn't mean I still need help sometimes. I really just need some help without any judgment �",
"I’m almost 5 months postpartum, I’m finally starting to feel a bit better and not so insane and dark. But I’m scared that something could trigger it and have it come back. I do have a history of depression/ anxiety/ ocd/ intrusive thoughts lol I really hit the lottery with mental health issues �
I’m considering getting back on birth control, my husband and I don’t want to have another for at least 2 years but I’m apprehensive about starting BC again since it can trigger PPD. Is there any specific forms that have worked best for you guys? I have taken the pill and had the IUD in the past but I have read many conflicting arguments on which ones affect women. Any advice/ tips/ sources would be so greatly appreciated so thank you so much in advance ��",
"Tw: fear of dying

I just need a listening ear right now. I’m looking for a therapist but I need to talk. Since I was 13 I have had a huge fear of dying. I was able to push it away mostly for 12 years but now since having my daughter I can’t seem to control it. It’s really hit me hard this last week. I have a huge passion for photography I love taking pictures on my camera and my phone but I can’t even get it out with out thinking “my daughter will love these one day” then down the rabbit hole I go. I can’t watch tv without spiraling? I turn med the kardashians on thinking it would be a distraction but I just think “wow how many years and they are still doing this?” Or even seeing their mom and thinking about how they will be when she’s gone. I feel nostalgic for the moments I’m in. My husband was making our daughter laugh and I just started crying because the moment would be gone. I woke her up this morning and started crying because she won’t be this small forever. I couldn’t even cook because I was thinking about how I’ll miss it one day. I feel insane and I’m here with out family or friends cause we moved a few years ago so I don’t have many distractions. Thank you for listening ",

I am 5 days postpartum from a c- section with my first child and I feel like everything i am doing is wrong, I don't feel like myself to the point that i feel disgustingly uncomfortable doing anything. It started the day we got home and I was already overwhelmed do to being surrounded constantly by people (my husband's parents and grandma were here from Arizona staying in out 1 bedroom apartment with usnon top of my family coming in and out) my husband has been so help full and amazing this whole time but I can't shake the feeling that he feels like im a burden and that I don't appreciate him and it's killing me. On top of that I don't feelnlike myself, breast feeding/pumping is extremely hard for me it make me internally horrible like im being violated. I feel so lonely because I'm mostly up at night with the baby because he doesn't want to sleep when I have him but seems to want to sleep when anyone else is holding him it makes me feel like such a terrible mom. I just don't know how to stop feeling like this.",
"Hi, I am 16 months post partum I had depression anxiety bpd and bipolar before child
 Birth. I’ve since went to therapy consistently for the last 8 years. and I am now medicated again. However I am empty. I get up drop him off at the sitter or if my husband is home I go to work (blue collar) and I come home and he’s ready for bed. I feel like I get no time with my child and I’m missing him growing up. My husband is military but has a desk job he travels a lot for work and I’m doing most of everything alone 80% of the time I would say. Taking care of our home our animals our baby and going to my 9 year old step sons activities along with working full time also. I am very jealous of my husband’s work when he travels. He goes to coasts mostly.  He doesn’t understand what I’d give to be at the beach away from my homely responsibilities. I am absolutely mentally exhausted and I feel empty. I don’t know how to fix this. We are in marriage counseling and any time I bring it up he says he doesn’t like leaving. Obviously that’s not my point. I’ve had post partum rage and depression and anxiety. 

Last trip he went on he was gone 10 days I had pneumonia and a temp up to 104 meanwhile our baby had RSV croup and an ear infection. 

Our sex life is absolutely nonexistent and he doesn’t touch me or give me attention. When we do have sex he doesn’t get off. All he wants to do is play fortnight. Someone please help or just listen. ",
"Hi everyone. FTM of the most beautiful 2yr old. Of late, in the past year or so I've had crippling thoughts of something terrible happening to my baby. The thoughts literally come out of nowhere and can be triggered by the simplest of things. Like watching a TV ad with a cruise ship and thinking that my baby will fall overboard. But I have absolutely no plans of going on a cruise or anything remotely close to that. Crazy right? I know it sounds terrible but please tell me I'm not alone. I hate this feeling. When it happens I literally have to take deep breaths and reassure myself that my baby is ok and nothing bad is going to happen. I can't talk to anyone about this because they will for sure think I'm crazy but I can't live like this and I don't know where to turn. Help please!",

"Not sure if this is the right sub for this?

Has anyone else had work related PPD? Not to say work is the singular reason, however, I cry almost every night about having to go to work the next day, dealing with certain aspects, etc. I started to feel this way while I was still pregnant and just figured it was hormones and being tired all the time.

I love and believe in the concept the business represents but my direct boss and working there itself brings me such dread I can barely function throughout the day.

Love my little so much though ❤️ Can't believe how lucky I am for the little.

Has this happened to anyone else? What did you do to fix it? Would love to hear different perspectives.",

I’ve never been on psychiatric meds before aside from adderall my sophomore year of high school. Starting Zoloft tomorrow for PPD and PPA. I’m so scared it’s going to make me feel worse even just for a few weeks. I don’t know if I can handle that. Anyone had a good experience with it pp?,

"I just want to start by saying i’m extremely guilty and feel like the worst mom on earth. I have two under two and both births didn’t go as planned as they both were pre mature. I’ve always dealt with anxiety and was trying my best both times to not fall into post partum depression. However not only both times did i fall into ppd i also had post partum rage. With my second I have been able to be a better mom due to the guilt from how i acted with my first. I don’t know how to get over it and honestly don’t even feel like i deserve them at times. But my first is almost two and when he was 10-12 months there were times when i may have sat him down rough (not as gentle as i should have), shouted at him, rammed the paci in his mouth when he wouldn’t stop screaming and even one time i popped him for “not listening” it was the smaller pop that he didn’t even react to but I feel like the biggest monster writing this. Please be gentle when commenting since i am in a very vulnerable place but i just need some support.

"I’m a first time mom. Idk if it’s okay to say but I just feel so invalidated and lonely. I’m happy to given birth to my baby but I also feel disassociated now that it’s just me and not have my baby in my belly. I miss that because it was just us two. I didn’t get to experience much of my pregnancy I slept on a couch for majority of my pregnancy because my partner and I were not on good terms. It became verbally abusive and I always was so tired and slept on the couch or chair or in the car and any chance to sleep on a bed I did. And it sucks every time I sleep on a bed that’s all I ever think about was from my pregnancy. I was so unhappy, I lost my first child due to not taking care of myself properly with heavy lifting. I didn’t get much support from him either or my family. I felt so alone. I went and tried for the second baby. I’m happy I did. But I regret being with my partner because of everything he made me feel. By calling me a bitch and motherfucker and especially on our baby gender reveal. He never was there much when I needed him and at the end i looked crazy. I didn’t get to experience a pregnancy shoot or take pictures and I regret it. And most of my time I didn’t even go out I sat in my moms living room for so many much. And when we were good and I sleep over it was on a twin bed. Idk I don’t feel like I’m me or people see me as the cheerful person I was before. My self esteem is gone and my mind is just negative. This partner of mine or idk what he really is I know it’s abusive. He got mad at me and said oh it must be your postpartum shit and god wish I just disappear. I mean I call him pretty bad names and wish he disappear and much worse. And my actions and choice of words caused a lot of issues. I really don’t know what’s best for me anymore. I feel so lonely and so idk how to feel good again for now. ",
"Hi everyone,

My wife gave birth to our beautiful baby boy at 5 days ago. The first nights were tough - baby has colic and my wife was exhausted. I stayed up all night and helped as best as I could - she did manage to get some sleep I believe. 

She has been emotionally drained however and I completely understand. I am a foreigner and we live in her country of origin and I speak the language only superficially, meaning that unfortunately the weight of the bureaucracy has fallen on her. I’ve helped by cooking meals and doing most house chores - cleaning, arranging as well as driving us around to appointments.

This afternoon something happened and my wife caught me absentmindedly eating a booger. Her mood changed in an instant. She became confrontational and irritated straight away. She told me I disgust her and that she doesn’t want me around nor want to sleep with me. 

I tried talking to her later. I was keeping the baby for an hour while she was showering. She came back to the room and asked me to leave or she would. I told her this was still our bed but if that meant she wouldn’t get enough sleep I’d leave her space.

I sent her a phone message later saying I love you and hope you have a goodnight sleep. And she replied with: “think about where do you want to take this relationship, because I honestly can’t imagine anything to do with you in terms of being your wife”. I asked her what did she mean by that and she replied that it’s very straightforward, she cannot see herself as my wife anymore, and she’s considering moving to her parents house or finding another arrangement. 

She said “I had never imagined this happening to this relationship but I guess it was due.”

I’m trying to calm myself down but I’m in the middle of a panic attack. As is she. I’m not sure this may be Postpartum rage or postpartum depression, but in case it is I want to support my wife through this dark forest. I’m open to any suggestions.

Thank you.

I'm pretty sure I have PPD. I wouldn't be surprised. I had surgery 3 weeks ago and my Son turns 3months in 2 days � I can't hold him like used to. It hurts to hold him because of my incisions I have on my stomach. I hate myself so much. I'm about to end it. His grandma takes such good care of him. He should have her to take care of him. He shouldn't have a mom like me. I should end myself so he can be surrounded by positivity and not by me who has severe mental health issues. I love him so much. I just want what is best for him. And what is best for him is for me to not be alive.,

"I made a post last week about Zoloft thinking my OB would put me on it. After going through my history- trying it about 6 years ago and it having negative effects, she suggested lexapro instead. For background I am 4 months PP dealing with depression and rage. I am breastfeeding and we want to try for another baby this year so a medicine safe for both of these situations is important. 

I am on day 3. I have not slept in 3 days. Maybe combined 6 hours. When I do get some sleep it is restless and horrible. I’m not one to overreact but this is actually worse than having a fresh newborn- sleep wise. Next I’m clenching my jaw without noticing, and it’s painful. I’m not sure if it’s because I get frustrated sleeping or what. Last, I’m late on my period, not pregnant. I saw online this could be because of lexapro. I really do not want it to hinder my fertility at all. 

I know everyone’s initial reaction is probably to change medications but I don’t want to give up. Only a few are really “safe” for pregnancy and breastfeeding. Has anyone else had these symptoms? How long do they last? I want to give it the month at least but this is no way to live. As for my mood I can’t tell a difference yet. Tyia ",
"I want to remain anonymous because I am scared of backlash on this. Please note in advance I love my babies deeply.

The last year has been rough. We had a rough pregnancy with lots of complications for me and my twins. One of the twins was in the NICU for 45 days. The other was in for 124 days and in two different hospitals. She ended up having heart surgery out of state. Hardest 4 months of my life. In that time, I was able to bond with one of the twins at home, I was able to breastfeed her for a while before my supply gave up due to stress. The other twin was strictly on an NG tube so she was never able to breastfeed before she was out of the hospital. By the time she was out my supply was gone. So I never got that bond with her. She’s been home for about two months now and I have not been able to form a bond with her. She spends a lot of time crying no matter how hard I try to comfort her. I feel like she hates me. She cries all day until her dad is home and then she smiles and laughs with him. (I’m a stay at home mom) The other twin loves me. I’m her favorite person ever. I don’t know what to do but I have no bond with the other twin and it hurts my heart. It almost annoys me. I’m annoyed by her constant crying without allowing me to comfort her but her dad can comfort her in an instant. And I’m annoyed by the lack of bond between us.. 

I don’t know if there are any moms here that have ever experienced this with twins or even one baby but it’s hard and it’s sending me into a spiral of depression. Can anyone help me with some sort of advice? :/",
"I (23 f) am new to reddit but I'm hoping for a little insight into what my future might look like. 

I'm 9 weeks pp and I feel like a shell just empty. I'm happy to have my baby but I feel so so lost just waiting for my maternity leave to end so I can go back to work and talk to adults but also sad to have to leave my baby. I ended up having an emergency c-section and I'm learning to accept my newly acquired scar and how my birth didn't go how I wanted it at all. I did my makeup and put on a dress for the first time pp and felt like fraud just so ugly, I'm so mad at my husband for doing this to me even tho I wanted a baby just as much as him. I've been lying on those little questionnaires that they give you at check ups but I feel ok somedays and absolutely horrible others and I'm wondering if I should get medical help or if it will level out on its own. 

I'm really really upset that I had to have a c-section and everyone around me is telling me to just be grateful to have a healthy baby which i am! It's just so hard to have nothing go the way I imagined it. Whenever I try to talk to my husband about how hard caring for our baby is and how I'm having a hard time he just says ""you knew parenting wasn't going to be easy"". It makes me livid when he says that shit. He's still on paternity leave as well but he spends his days sleeping and playing computer games for the most part. He'll watch the baby for about an hour or 2 at a time once or twice a day. So I feel like he doesn't understand what I'm going through at all I'm watching the baby at least 20 hours a day and he acts like those few hours are so hard on him. 

The pp rage is really getting to me. I want to watch the world burn. Anyway back to my point how do I start to feel like a person again because rn it feels like my life is over. 

Is there anything I can do to feel better in my day to day?

I’m already on Wellbutrin & buspar and it’s no longer working which sucks because I’ve been on it since pretty much the first horrid pp experience. I’m breastfeeding & super nervous about gaining any more weight - I’m already 200 lbs… any meds that have worked better for other moms and not cause any side effects / hard to baby? I’m meeting with someone tomorrow but curious to know personal stories ,
"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post.. my LO is 15 months, and they’re amazing I love being their mom!
My husband and I moved two hours from our home town right after we had our baby, we couldn’t afford to buy a home in the place we grew up so we moved away.

Fortunately, my husbands family has been very supportive and visit and help a ton, we have been here for almost two years and I absolutely still hate the new area, I’m home sick everyday and all I want to do is move back, this was the biggest mistake I feel like moving out here.. here’s the issue… my mother in law (who is our biggest help) has followed us out here and bought a home right around the corner from us which is amazing. So I feel incredibly guilty for toying with the idea of moving back when she made this huge change to be closer to her grandkids (kids as in plural.. her other son also lives near by which sparked the move for everyone-us included)

I feel like I’m the worst person for wanting to move back but everyday I’m here I get more and more depressed, I feel like it just doesn’t feel like home and it never will. Everyone thought this feeling I’m having would go away (being a new mom, taking time to get used to a new area) but it hasn’t.. I hate it here so much and I hate it just as much as I did when we moved here (almost two years ago now)

Before anyone recommends mom groups and getting out more.. I’ve done that. I do have some great neighbors I hang out with, I have a good job here and I’ve met tons of people. I just want to be back home. And I don’t want to break my mother in laws heart but it’s driving a wedge between my husband and I because I’m starting to resent him for moving us here. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated ",
"Can someone please tell me if I will get better???? I have severe insomnia because I have horrid  PPA and the lack of sleep is causing depression. I just took my first pill of Zoloft 25mg last night and didn’t sleep at all… I feel doomed, like I will never be better. Anyone experience this? ",
"I read this quoted on Facebook today:

Postpartum was the darkest period of my life. The exhaustion, the anxiety, the overwhelming emotions, and the constant feeling of not being enough-it was more than I ever expected.

People say it gets better, and it does, but there’s no timeline for healing. And when you’re in the thick of it, those words don’t always bring comfort.

If you’re struggling right now, please know you’re not alone. The darkness is not your fault, the intrusive thoughts don’t define you, and there is no shame in what you’re going through. You are doing the best you can, and that is enough.��❤️‍�✨",

"I’m curious. Has anyone who is currently dealing with, or has survived postpartum depression, or psychosis, ever thought they met the criteria for adhd and/or autism? I’m curious as how that could negatively affect their attempts at recovery and treatment, if those additional conditions were not included in your treatment plan. ",
"I’m 10 month PP and am having a hard time. Since early January I’ve cried pretty much everyday and feel like I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m already taking 80mg Prozac (max dose), 50 mg trazodone, 10 mg Wellbutrin and Xanax if needed and therapy. I feel like I’m on none of those and everything feels bad. I don’t know why I’m sad, but thinking about how sad I am makes me cry. I’m also having a very hard time getting through the work day, my performance is not good and I’m afraid I’m going to get in trouble.

Anyway…what meds work(ed) for you? 

I also feel like therapy doesn’t help me because I don’t know why I’m so sad and nothing brings me joy even if I try.",
"I haven't sat for a full meal in months. I try to pursue hobbies but never get a break from the baby or housework. My pos family judges me for not calling more (states away), my husband has high sex drive and always wants to fuck, and the baby hates the car so going literally anywhere is a scream fest. So I never leave and I'm always chasing after this child. I'd never do it, but sometimes I just want to off myself cuz that's the only way I'd get a break.
Fuck I hate my life right now.
End useless rant that no one cares about. ",
"So lately ive been frustrated with my fiancé and just in general and last night i decided to open up and talk about how i feel a little just telling him how frustrated I am that I have to pick to either eat, sleep, or pump when baby sleeps and how sleep deprived I am and how anxious I've been lately. And it felt like he was listening ... that is until this morning. I do all the feedings at night if I decide to not pump. He then takes the early morning feeds. But he gets uninterrupted sleep from 11 latest till 6 am earliest depending on baby. Last night was no different, I did all the feedings. So this morning he has the audacity to tap me at 8 am to tell me to go make her a bottle lol. I'm so sleep deprived and at my last nerve that I told him to go make it himself. Not to mention he looked annoyed at me when he came back into the room. Then he proceeded to just keep waking me up from 8 to 9:30 that at some point I was like whatever just give me my child. 

I just wish he understood how goddamn sleep deprived I am that I'm literally having visual hallucinations, nothing serious but enough for me to think about getting my eyes checked. It's also making me even more anxious even more depressed, I'm just not happy anymore. Sometimes I feel guilt for feeling regret of having my baby and yet I still love her but at the same time sometimes I look at her and I just feel nothing and it makes me sadder. There's times where I've also thought of leaving him and even times where I've thought of leaving both of them behind. I just want more help from his end and more sleep because I truly think that would solve most of these feelings. ",
"Did you experience weight gain on Zoloft (Sertraline)? If so, would you link it to an actual change in metabolism that is caused, or an increase in appetite? 

I am terrified to start this medication but know I need it. I feel like I can control my appetite but I’m terrified if it actually changes your metabolism…

I got pregnant last February my husband was grossed out about having sex with me while pregnant which okay I guess i understand. But now 3 months postpartum I asked him about it and he made me feel awful by saying why are you focused on that type of thing made me feel dirty about it I just told him I missed us being intimate he responded with wow I thought our relationship means more to you the just sex made me feel horrible I have been rejected now so many times I feel unloved and it has me questioning myself. I gained 50 pounds while pregnant already lost 42 my body looks almost the same as what I looked like pre pregnancy i know he still watches porn I just don’t understand…,
"Hello all!

My brother and his gf had their first baby in the fall. She has always been a bit crazy even before she got pregnant (example: made a scene at the grocery store and squared up to an older lady because she told my brother he had unique eyes - which he does, he’s received that compliment his whole life) but since having the baby, her emotions have been at an all time high on both ends. I feel terrible for her because there is no neutral ground for her anymore.

I believe she knows she is having signs of PPD as she’ll post on social media crying about the baby and how she’s struggling but when my brother tries to help with anything or simply talk to her, she rages and tells him how stupid he is or that he’s a POS. One time I was on the phone with him when he asked if he could feed the baby for her because she was tired and she started screaming and said she would c*t her head off and c*t her wrist if that would make him leave her alone. About twice a week she packs her car up with the baby’s things and tries to take her daughter to her grandmas to live there while my brother is at work. Yesterday when she tried that it was because my brother was active on Snapchat while he was at work (it was something I sent him) and she thought he was cheating (he’s never cheated a day in his life). 

He’s tried to bring up the ppd with her and talked about her speaking with the doctor and she just wants no part of it and gets mad again. At this point, I’m worried about her, my brother, AND the baby all being in an environment that can get that extreme. He’s at a loss for what to do and how to help, she’s living like she doesn’t want to acknowledge it, and unfortunately she doesn’t really have any friends or family she can confide in. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!!

(Side note - I’m sorry if I come off insensitive or not understanding in any way. I’ve got no kids but I do understand how much your body goes through and how easy it is to be all over the place while you try to heal. Again, I’m just looking for help for them)",

"I am a doctor, i used to work but took a break to write a few exams and decided to have a baby( husbands choice, i was fine with never having one) . I wasnt forced, i just never really thought about having kids. Decided it was the best time to have one while i was on leave( it was supposed to be a year long break to finish my exams. 

I got pregnant pretty quick and suffered chronic UTI throughout the pregnancy. My baby was also very large so i had a lot of pain and trouble breathing by the end of pregnancy. Had a very traumatic delivery as well. Ended up with a 10 pound baby who never ever sleeps. 

In all of this my husband has done nothing. The bare minimum of giving a bottle of milk once or twice a week, taking care of the baby for a couple of hours once or twice a week. 
I am resentful, he has sacrificed nothing for this baby, not a single night , and he is being hailed as a great father. I have done everything and i am being made the villain for complaining about lack of sleep and for asking my husband to help more. 

I have gone through so many sleepless nights that i have started having hallucinations and nightmares and sleep paralysis. I begged my husband to care for the baby one night so i can try and sleep 8-10 hour at a stretch. 
He slept before i could actually make him go through this. He slept 10 hours the next day as well. And the next day. 

He works, i dont. And somehow that makes it easier for him to do no childcare and everyone justifies it as well. He was also very unhelpful during my pregnancy and made me cry hours after postpartum . He forced me to keep a name his parents wanted and didnt speak to me postpartum until i agreed . 

I am so tired. I have stopped interacting with him now and i am getting religious texts from his mother about how i need to find god to cure my depression and texts from her son about booking a psychiatrist.
I am aware i have depression, i have had it before when my father passed away so i know what it looks like, yet them acknowledging it is pissing me off? I dont know how to respond to this situation now. 

Ps - divorce is not an option . ",
"So to start things off my mom died in august of 2023 i found out i was pregnant with my first child 3 days before her funeral. I was emotionally wrecked, confused, and scared. I’m still actively grieving which doesn’t help. I stupidly moved in with my baby’s father 3 months before our son was born. He promised that we would build a strong relationship and be a family. He painted me this beautiful picture. My baby is 9 months now. Living with him for all these months i realize he is a mysgonstic, alcoholic, cheater. He hasn’t had sex with me since he got me pregnant or anything physical. He says it’s because he’s scared of getting me pregnant again but i caught him on tinder trying to have a threesome with a lady and her husband. He doesn’t compliment me anymore. He treated his paternity leave like a vacation for 3 months. I’ve tried everything to make this work because i want us to be a family but i think i’ve just accepted that he doesn’t want me :( My self esteem is completely shattered and i’ve been feeling so depressed lately. He says with his words that he does want me and wants to be family but his actions absolutely show me differently. I feel absolutely broken and lost. I’m only 20 years old and moved to a different state away from my family. I only have a part time job and it’s hard for me to save with expenses. My family can’t really help me and i fear i’m screwed. ",
"This probably isn’t the right place to post about this, but I just need help, or even just kind words.

So I worked in childcare prior to having my baby and finding a nanny/daycare job that’s okay with my daughter tagging along has been more than a struggle. I’ve had a ton of families from Facebook groups requesting my services, then all of a sudden get ghosted as soon as they find out I have a baby as if that wasn’t wasn’t in my description they found me from. 

Anyways, I’m 1 month postpartum and finally got a job offer from a daycare, I’d be in charge of the infants class 9/hrs a day, 5 days/week. The catch is that I’d need alternate care for my daughter since she can’t be in the infants class because I’m in charge of it. So basically I’d need to be okay with a complete stranger at a separate daycare watching over my precious daughter for half of the week and just trust that nothing bad would happen to her until she’s able to age in to the older group at my daycare about a year from now. 

The thought alone of being away from her that long and that often feels like I’m getting my heart ripped out of my chest, I don’t even want to know how painful it will be once I actually have to do it. 

Please tell me how to be okay with this. ",
"I 24F and my boyfriend’s 25M relationship has been really honestly struggling ever since I found out I was pregnant. Some context: we were only together for a year, living together for 5 months before getting pregnant, it was obviously not planned (but we did nothing to prevent it). When we found out thats where everything started to crumble, he wanted me to have an abortion- I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself and I have the financial means on my own to care for a baby on my own. It took weeks, I even had an appointment set up at planned parenthood to appease him, finally I stood up for myself and told him I am doing this with or without him and completely understand if he wanted to leave, I gave him multiple outs. 

He decided to stay and “learn to accept the baby” but not help with anything, so I spent my entire pregnancy going to appointments alone, planning the nursery, learning everything you need to know to be a parent, etc. Also, while still cooking every day, our home became a mess because I couldn’t keep up with the cleaning. He would also purposely do things to stress me out, he doesn’t like my dog so he’d purposely antagonize him to make him growl/bark/yelp just to get a reaction out of him. I’d scream and yell and tell him he’s stressing me out so bad and I need him to stop, leave the dog alone and he wouldn’t.

Fast forward to now, our son is here and 5 months old and he is the absolute love of our life’s. He is a great dad on paper, he loves our son unconditionally and would do anything for him, but he needs instructions for everything. I work from home so I am home with the baby all day, while working. He comes home at around 6:30ish every day and will greet and hold the baby but won’t do anything else unless I explicitly ask. I cook dinner for us most nights (on the nights I don’t I pick and pay for the takeout) Ex: I have to ask him hey can you change the baby so I can finish making YOUR dinner, can you give him this bottle so I can take a shower, can you put him down for the night, Its exhausting. I feel like I am both a housewife and a project manager assigning tasks for him to do. 

The issues with the dog is still there, he just will not leave the dog alone, he goes out of his way to antagonize him tells me “I can’t wait for him to die” “I hope he chokes and dies” “I hate him”, then when I get angry he tells me that I am being dramatic, it was a joke and that I’m a terrible dog mom and he isn’t trained. 

I’ve told him so many different times, I don’t feel loved by you, I need more etc. He gets angry and will give me the silent treatment every time I voice my issues. It’s gotten to the point I’ve just began keeping it to myself because nothing changes anyways. I feel like I am constantly just victimizing myself, I can’t even see his side to things anymore. 

I don’t know what to do, I love him, I want to be together and for it to be genuine, I cannot stay with him just because of our baby.  I’m sick of feeling this way.

TLDR: Since my pregnancy, I’ve felt unsupported. My boyfriend loves our son but only helps when asked, dismisses my feelings, and antagonizes my dog. I feel exhausted, unloved, and unsure how to move forward, even though I want our relationship to work, I’m afraid its too far gone",
"I’m a single mom who has an 8 month old beautiful, happy & healthy little daughter. There’s only one huge issue, I’ve grown to not love her. When I first had her I loved her and wanted to be with her all the time but with time these feelings have slowly faded away. 

I knew what I was getting myself into, lack of sleep, not loving motherhood all the time, diaper changes, etc. The one thing I didn’t expect was for me to not like her. Being around her makes me anxious, she annoys me. Sometimes I do love her and we have cute moments where everything feels like it ”should be” but they’re rare. Sometimes I wish I never had her and then a feeling of guilt washes over me for even thinking like that, I lie to everyone and tell them I love being a mom but in reality I’m miserable. I feel so ashamed by these feelings and that I feel like I don’t love her most of the time, I hate myself for it. I feel like I can’t tell anyone about these feelings cause they’ll see me differently. 

I take good care of her and everyone tells me what a great mom I am and that she’s lucky to have me and it makes me feel like a fraud.

What do I do? Have anyone had these feelings? Do they pass? ",
"First time mum and baby is just over 6 weeks. Baby blues kicked in around day 4 and sleep deprivation and breastfeeding struggles seem to have led to PPD.

I feel so lost and lonely and overwhelmed. I want to enjoy my baby and not constantly think I’ve made a huge mistake and ruined both our lives. 

I feel worse day by day, I’m struggling to sleep or rest when I have help. Weather is crap so it’s hard getting out for walks. My anxiety is sky high to the point I’m struggling to leave the house, I was supposed to go to baby massage today but had a meltdown instead.

She has said consistently that’s she wants to break up to work on her self and figure things out. She has finally started connecting with the baby again but with me she has moments where she said she wants to be with me just can’t find the feeling in all the hormones changing. She also wants to reach out to an old guy friend that kinda just abandoned her when they got close to figure out why it doesn’t work I don’t know if it’s the postpartum anymore. This isn’t her I don’t even recognize her. She has reached out for help but the therapist through the ob next appointment is 3 weeks away. I don’t know if she didn’t tell the therapist everything but I know this isn’t her and she making decisions she never would’ve made her parents cry everyday and so do I. Any advice she also asked i move back in with my mom so she can have time alone.,

Anyone else here dealing with the same? I don’t feel okay and I’m feeling like it’ll just go on forever. It’s been less than a month and I feel like I can’t function like this. I feel really bad when I think about my kids and husband and how it’s affecting them. I’m always crying and feeling irritated or upset. I can’t help everyone the way I did before and I just want to disappear sometimes. I hate that this is what a woman’s body might do after delivering.. it just doesn’t make any f’ng sense to torture us after things are hard enough. I experienced PPD after having babies but I feel even worse this time. The grief and anxiety and depression feel like too much. I have a doctor trying to help me and a therapist but I still feel hopeless a lot of the time. ,

"With my first I had a very traumatic birth experience, my postpartum was horrible and started experiencing  psychosis. I let my family know what I was going through (I have tons of family on both my husbands and my side) and no one showed up for me. 3 and half years later I gave birth to my second who is an angel baby. She’s a little over a week old and the only problem I’m having is she is not sleeping at all between 2-6am and she’s sleeping all day. I’m still trying to navigate a schedule but with my husband going back to work tomorrow it’s going to be an extra load on me between drop off and pick up and the preschool which is only 3 hours 4 days a week, between cooking meals, between cleaning, between going grocery shopping while it’s -40 out with a new born. I cry to my mom on the phone she doesn’t care, but then again she was in the delivery room when I delivered my first and saw how traumatic it was and nearly lost me and her grand daughter and still didn’t show up for me. My other siblings have so much support from my mom, and regarding my in-laws I have helped them soooo much. No one has cooked a single meal for us, no one has called me and said hey I’m going to come for an hour to keep your toddler busy so you can get some rest.

"4 months PP… I hate my partners dog

So this really started around 5 or 6 months pregnant,I really started to hate my dog. He’s not bothersome, but something about him now just sparks pure irritation in me. I know he’s getting really old (he’s 13). He’s overly clingy and drools so much. His rightful owner (his dad) doesn’t really take care of him so it falls on me.. maybe it’s more resentment than hate? Is this normal?
Keep in mind his actual owner(dad and my child’s father) is an alcoholic. Who told me my rage and depression were just in my head. He said postpartum depression isn’t real..",
"My baby boy is 10weeks old. I have help at home to take care of baby. My husband usually very helpful and supportive. Once he got back to work after 1week of paternity leave, he has been working a lot(even weekends) from last 2weeks and not even spending 10mins with the baby daily. It’s bothering me a lot, I know he has lot of work to do however I am feeling sad about it.",
"Okay this is kind of embarassing to admit. Ever since I gave birth 9 months ago I’ve been craving alcohol more than normal. I feel like a 21 year old college kid again. On average i have probably 0-2 drinks a day during the week, and 3-4 a day on weekends. My therapist told me the threshold for possibly developing a physical dependence is 14 a week so I think I’m starting to push it. There is a history of substance abuse in my family which has me extra concerned for myself.

For context, I’m medicated for PPD. I’ve really struggled with the lifestyle shift of being a parent and being tethered to a baby all the time. Getting tipsy/drunk is one of the only ways I feel I can cope, escape the dread, and tap into my pre-parenthood self. 

For the sake of myself and my family, i want to be more mindful of my consumption. If you’ve been in a similar situation, what habit/lifestyle changes have worked for you to improve your relationship with alcohol?",
"I was diagnosed with postpartum depression when baby was around 10-12 weeks old.
She spent the first six weeks of her in hospital while having open heart surgery at two weeks old.

I had to give birth in another city and spent 9 weeks away from my three year old. I saw him once in that time. I really really struggled being away from home and my son. I struggled with the isolation of the hospital environment. Thankfully my husband was with me most of the time except for when I was rooming in with bubs. 

Looking back I think the PND started during pregnancy after the heart condition was detected at the anatomy scan. It was a stressful pregnancy mentally and being my third pregnant it really took a toll on my body so it was hard physically. 

I also have unresolved grief and emotions surrounding my first baby who was stillborn.

So, it's not really surprising that I'm struggling with motherhood this time around. I am angry ALL the time. I rage out often. I'm a shitty person to be around. I resent my baby and have not established a real bond with her. I feel so freakn shitty and guilty for this feelings. She's just being a normal baby doing normal things but everything is so so hard. I'm sick of it being hard.

My husband is amazing and does as much as he can. My oldest is in preschool three days a week and I do have family support. I am incredibly grateful for my support system. I would be very lost without them.

I'm taking meds. I'm doing therapy. I'm trying but nothing is getting better. I'm so scared of never having a bond with her. I'm scared of ruining her because I yell at her. I swear at her. It's awful and it's wrong. But I get so frustrated I have to get it out somehow and it's not always realistic to put her down and walk away. I just want to run away from everything and everyone. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of it being so hard. ",
"I am 8 weeks postpartum with a healthy baby boy, but I am dealing with postpartum depression. He is doing great and I feel like I'm starting to bond with him, but sometimes I just feel... off. I find myself frequently spacing out when I'm feeding him and even when I'm surrounded by family and friends. It feels like I'm alone though I know I'm not. Recently, I realized my most prominent feeling is like I had a miscarriage (I've never experienced a miscarriage and this is our first baby, but that is the only way I can think to describe the way I'm feeling). Since my baby was inside me growing for so long, I got used to feeling him move. After giving birth, I obviously don't feel him move anymore, and it just feels like I'm empty inside. I know it's not rational, and I understand he's perfectly okay, but I feel this intense sense of loss. My mom and sister don't know the feeling I'm talking about, so I kind of feel like I'm going crazy. I'm working with my psychiatrist to adjust my current meds (I have bipolar, anxiety and insomnia) but I'm looking for support anywhere I can find it, and I guess some validation about the way I'm feeling. Surely I can't be the only one who has felt this feeling. Thanks for reading. ❤️",

Children. My resentment towards my husband grows and grows and the feeling of being trapped replaces thw feeling of happiness. 
The guilt I feel for the way I feel overwhelms me leaving me in tears daily. I feel so unappreciative for the sacrifices my husband has made. For the way he has stayed by myself through each episode of darkness I have went through over our years of marriage. 
I know everything will be fine. I know that this feeling will go away but right now sitting in the middle of it.. it feels like I'm loosing myself. That all I am is a mother and a wife.

It has been tangled for about a month due to lack of brushing and probably postpartum hair loss. My partner helped brush out my ends and they’re better but they’re getting tangled again. We split it in to sections and used detangling spray. Although I have a huge matte on the back of my head next to my scalp we didn’t get to. I’ve been procrastinating dealing with it. It’s really bad. I’m not sure about how to go about getting it out. �� I’m not sure if I’m looking for tips or just venting and looking for others in similar situation so I don’t feel alone. So any advice or similar stories with what you did to fix it would be greatly appreciated. 

I’m on Zoloft and it seems to help some but it’s definitely still hard. � Thanks for reading. ",
"I mean yeah I have calm moments but for the most part I am so sensitive. I had a traumatic second birth experience and now I have Covid so I have to stay away from everybody and the baby. Hurts really bad on top of having post partum preeclampsia and C-section. I just want a hug and the person that I want passed away, my mom.",
"Its been a week since i had my daughter and im 17 pounds down (i was 193 pre pregnancy ,lost weight during pregnancy and got down to 180 and gained it back to about 197 at the end ). But ive realized since ive been home ive had no apetite. The first 2 days at the hosptial i was eating fine but now i eat one a day.  Idk if this is a sign of ppd (cause i am aware i have it) or if its just my body going back to normal? This is also my first time in 3 years not on birth control or pregnant so maybe thats why?  ",
"I’m posting this because I see a lot of posts asking for something to help with PPD. My wife had really bad PPD with our first child. It was hard to see her go through it. We are now expecting our 4th child and she has been managing it better with each pregnancy. 

She decided that she wants to help moms, new and veterans, to manage their PPD. We’re not medical professionals but we are working with family medical doctors, OBGYN’s, nurses and midwives. We’re a few months away from launching a product but it would be something you can get hopefully by April. Until then, magnesium, zinc, red raspberry leaf tea, fenugreek and vitex have been proven to reduce symptoms of PPD but some of these reduce effectiveness of birth control so keep that in mind. We hope this helps",
"I am freshly postpartum and my world is reeling from how quick transition from pregnancy, through birth, then now has been. My husband has been absolutely wonderful support and so in love with our baby - physical recovery so far has been uncomfortable but I’ve been able to just heal in bed while easing into breastfeeding, motherhood, etc. But, I am an emotional wreck. I have a history of mental health challenges, which I’ve been able to manage with my husband and healthcare providers in my corner, and pregnancy was wonderful. 

I was prepared to feel a lot of heightened emotion but am surprised at how it’s manifesting. I feel this overwhelming, suffocating grief and sadness now that pregnancy is over. I’m grateful my baby is here and that we get to spend our lives together, but I’m devastated. It’s the most confusing feeling - so happy yet so sorrowful. I wasn’t ready to no longer feel kicks or rolls, to not have my giant belly, to not listen to his heartbeat at appointments… I can’t even look at ultrasounds or photos of me while pregnant without sobbing. 

And when I say sobbing, I mean sometimes to the point of just escalating into pure panic. Then the anxious thoughts starts because now that I’m not pregnant, I can’t protect my baby like I could before and something could happen. I can’t wait to watch baby grow but at the same time I want time to freeze so I can just stay in this newborn phase with my family forever. My heart can’t handle the thought of change. I just stare at the little hands and toes and cry. I’m not sure if that even makes sense. 

I’m not overwhelmed by anything except how I feel. The hormone crash is intense. I’ve talked to my husband about how I’ve been feeling and it’s a struggle to form sentences through the tears. My Dr. was able to see me today and gave me referrals to great resources. So, I’m not alone. I also am aware that emotional upheaval is normal and will most likely pass as my body adjusts but… I just needed one more second with my beautiful baby while pregnant. To feel that connection again. My heart is so full and so heavy.

"To all of the people in this group, I just wanted to share something that helped me tremendously on my PPD journey. I had pretty terrible PPD with a NICU baby, emergency c-section, and near-death experience during childbirth - it was one of the most challenging periods of my life. Not to mention hating breastfeeding and wanting to throw my husband off a cliff. 

I did a ton of therapy, and after a while, my therapist suggested that I try psilocybin. I tried it, and it truly changed my life. It was like 50 therapy sessions in 5 hours. I don't know where I would be without today. I share this because I learned that there is a stage 2 clinical trial where moms with PPD can get access to a psilocybin experience. If anyone is really struggling - it might be worth looking into - it's incredible to be on the other side of crippling depression. 

Feel free to DM or chat me, and I can share more.

"So, I found out that I had post partum depression/ rage after my mom had a serious conversation with me about it when my son was about 4 months old. Well I talked to my doctor and got on the medication. And I was in it for a while and then I ran out and wasn’t able to get more of the medication but I didn’t think I needed it bc I was feeling fine all of the bad thoughts and everything were gone, and then about 2-3 weeks later it came back and it was worse. So I figured out a way to get a refill of my medicine and it helped for a little bit and then I ran out again. And this happened about two more times, I’d run out and wouldn’t be able to get more and it’d come back worse a couple weeks later. Well this time I haven’t been on the medicine for about 5 months. And I’m still struggling but it’s been enough that I can manage it by myself without medication. But here the last week or two my son (16months) has been teething and he’s been an absolute menace he’s constantly getting into everything, he doesn’t want me to pick him up or touch him but he also doesn’t want me to put him down so it’s nom stop screaming and fighting. And not to mention he’s been constantly hitting and kicking and head butting me. And I try to do the whole “gentle hand s” and rub my face with hus hand but that doesn’t work it pisses him off more, I tried popping him when he hits me and that makes it worse, I’ve tried ignoring it and that does absolutely nothing. Im a single mother, hus dad says he wants to be in his life but puts in no effort to see him or help with him. I am out if a job right now, and even if I wanted to go back to work there’s no one who can watch my son while im at work, and no one who can bring me to work unless I work nights, but if u work nights I won’t be able to sleep at all, my son has a total of maybe one to three hours in naps a day, and I can’t survive off 1-3 hours of sleep a day. And I live with my grandmother and aunt and uncle, and I want so badly to ask for help but I can’t bc they’re always tired from work and stuff and I feel so crappy asking for help. But I need help, I need to get away from my kid for one day. I love him so fucking much but I can’t breathe. Im starting to get extremely angry withh him extremely quickly, and there’s been a couple times that I almost did hurt him and I had to force myself to put him in his bed and I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get help, I can’t get anyone to bring me to get more medicine, I can’t even get help from hus father. We’re stuck in this house all day everyday with no way to go anywhere bc I don’t have a car. Im so scared i don’t want to be a bad mother, I don’t want to raise my voice at my son. I don’t want to hurt my son. I need help. I need to know what to do to keep it from getting worse. And I’m so scared to post this bc I don’t want someone calling dfcs and getting my son taken away, I love him so much he’s my entire world which is why I’m asking for help. U just need help to get myself out of this stupid funk. I need to know how u can control the bad feelings without medication bc I can’t get it. I just need help.",
"Hi all,

Im a FTM, my daughter is now 2 and things are “normalizing” for me now with work and my daughter is in child care. 

When i gave birth, it was a really bad time for me as i had ppd and felt so alone. Recovered alone, took care of daughter alone, financially had to support family alone as husband lost his job and was depressed too. It was a tough almost 1 yr going through that alone but i’ll never forget the things MIL did and said to me at that time.

Recently i was looking through old pics of my daughter and emotions from my ppd days came flooding in. I started to break down bcs the feelings i felt still seems so raw. Im supposed to visit my MIL but i told my husband i didnt want to see MIL bcs of this raw feelings and flashback. - important to note that we do visit her every 3-4 weeks but she’s demanding to visit every 1-2 week now and its causing me major anxiety thinking about seeing her that often

He was visibly upset and he didnt understand why i “couldnt” get over it. I told him he wouldnt understand bcs i was so alone and the feelings are still so fresh in my mind, even though it has been 2 years. While i feel he should be more understanding, i know it sucks for him too always being in the middle. 

Does it get better? Will i forget about my ppd days one day? 

Feeling sad �",
I have an appointment with my OB next week to get on medication. I’m out of options. I am breastfeeding and we want to try for another baby sometime this year. Has anyone used Zoloft while breastfeeding/pregnant and how was that experience? Thank you so much in advance. I’ve been putting this off since I was pregnant but I know it’s what is best for me and my family. ,
"Next week, my husband is going back to work, and we have a three week old. I just cant help myself from spiraling. I can only count the days I didnt cry since I gave birth. I had a traumatic birth (emergency c section due to failure to progress). No family member around (we live overseas away from them). My baby is unsettled everynight for hours and it is really hard to put her to sleep (growth spurt). Everything is just ovewhelming. I feel alone and isolated most days. 

Any advice how to cope?",
"I’m 4 weeks PP. my birth was easy with my son except I sprained my knee and hip. The first week home with my husband was fine. He went back to work and I’ve been sad, anxious, and angry.

I just feel empty every time I look at myself. I love my son so much but I feel like I have died. We have an 18 month old golden doodle, who acts great when my husband is home but when I’m alone with her, she grabs burb cloths, pacifiers, our laundry, and some other things. I think it’s because she likes me chasing her and thinks it’s play, but I can’t chase her as well with my leg so I’ve had to lure her with treats and grab whatever when she’s been eating the treat. Lately I feel like if it’s not my son crying, my dog is whining, and I’m trying to keep the house in relative order. My leg hurts so much from all the walking around the house I’m doing it’s extremely painful for me to do the night feeds, so my husband is doing it, which is making me feel guilty as well.

I was pretty good at showering when my son naps but lately I’m too scared to so I’ve waited until my husband gets home, usually I’m begging him to walk the dog (she’s usually whining to go out, but he’s does the ‘she’s fine give me a few minutes’) so I can shower with peace of mind that someone is around if he needs anything. 

I get really mad now about everything. All the visitors we’ve been having I’m annoyed, when I don’t have visitors I’m anxious about being alone all day. I can’t go anywhere because I’m having car issues right now. I’m in so much pain with my legs, I’ve considered trying to cut my leg off.  I’m annoyed at my husband because I spend my time cleaning up the items he leave out that my dog is grabbing and when I’m trying to have a a few minutes of me time, he ends up yelling for me to come look at what our son is doing. I’ve yelled at my dog so much and said things that are out of character for me. I’ve thought about leaving her outside and leaving her at the pound. I’ve thought about dropping her and my son off at my moms and fleeing. I say frequently I wish my husband could take my mat leave and I can go back to work. I go to sleep hoping I don’t wake up. I just feel like I’m failing everyone around me. I try talking to my husband and his solution is either to get rid of our dog or putting our son up for adoption, both I genuinely do not want because I love them both so much. I just am angry at the right now but idk how it gets better when I’m the problem? ",

"I am 7mo postpartum. I called the nurses line today to ask about my pp rage. You are probably wondering why I haven’t said something sooner. Well I thought well maybe it will be better when we are sleeping more or when we get a break from teething or when we aren’t sick or when we take better naps. Here we are 7 months later and we are sleeping and not currently teething and my rage seems to be even worse. So I called the nurses line at myOBs office and told them what I have been feeling and the first thing the nurse said is that I’m a little far into postpartum with the most judgement tone. The whole time she was asking me questions I felt so stupid for even calling them. The conversation ended with her saying well I guess I’ll talk to your doctor, but the tone said that she didn’t really want to though. I do like my actual Doctor Who delivered me very much. The whole conversation left me feeling like they were gonna call CPS on me or so then I’m actually just crazy and nothing is wrong. ",
"I feel so nauseous. I know that I don’t have a lot of time left before my baby starts being able to make memories. I’m so heartbroken that I know I’ll never be able to spend a life with her but it’s for the best. If I stay a primary care provider in her life I’m just going to ruin her the same way I’m ruined. My therapy hasn’t helped, the hospital visits haven’t helped, and neither have my meds and I just don’t have faith that another year or two is going to fix the negative self talk and anxiety enough that I can feel confident that she won’t grow up thinking this is normal. I don’t want her to think that being like this is normal or healthy. At this point I’m considering moving back in with my parents and just sending her father my full paychecks so I can do nothing but provide for her and not ruin her the way I’m ruined. I love her so much but I don’t want to make things bad for her. I grew up with an unstable and mentally ill parent and it was torture and I just can’t subject her to that. I love her so much and I’m so miserable thinking about what I’ll miss but I know it’s for the best. ",
I have two boys who sleep so SHITTY. How am I suppose to function on very little sleep? I have no village. I’m a SAHM. I’m crying because I am so tired. I hate life. I don’t want to do this anymore. ,
"As subject stated, usually at night when it’s dark alone with my baby and he won’t sleep for more than 3 hours just crying and fussing non stop dealing with sleep deprivation and anxiety. 

When will it go away? Is this normal? I wish on myself constantly to have a heart attack or actually do something harmful to myself but all THOUGHTS i love my husband and baby so much but this newborn trenches is getting the best of me, i was doing therapy past two months when my baby was in NUCU for 72 days and losing his twin brother… at that time i was way better emotionally than now! How! 

I am stuck.. i have no time for therapy now my husband is working 12 hrs a day when he’s back he sleeps for the next shift does maybe one or two feeding sessions when i can sleep for 2-3 hrs per day. 

Also pumping is driving me crazy whenever i do i have this feeling of doom! Like i will have a panic attack hearing the pumping noise. 
",
"After 7 doses I felt like I turned a corner. I was able to stop and control my worrying. I was able to relax. I stopped having suicidal thoughts completely. I felt hopeful for the first time in months. I felt happy. I’m back to my baseline depression and anxiety that I had before pregnancy. I’m grateful but I’m still so afraid the depression will come back. I’ve had two serious episodes and I feel like the zurzuvae was my last resort, I don’t know what I’ll do if the PPD returns. 
I finished my last dose one week ago and I’m on my longest no-cry streak since giving birth! ",
"Firstly, I’m a second time father.  My current gf and I had our first child (my second) 6 months ago.  We have our issues of course, but the last 6 months I’ve felt my gf slip away.  I now see how I’ve frustrated her with trying to help solve problems and always be the “solutions guy” even when not asked.  The sad part is, we used to have really open, vulnerable communication at the beginning of our two year relationship, but as of late, attempting even that has been met with what I can only describe as a sullen teenager’s response (aggression, dismissal, annoyance) from my partner.  Now I realize this is a very delicate period but things have progressively worsened, coming to a head about a month ago in an argument in which we both screamed at each other.  This is definitely not the norm for us but since then it’s effectively been two individuals coexisting in a home.  I tried to hug her a week later and the look of disdain I received was gut wrenching.  

Fast forward to Monday and she completely moved out while I was at work, taking almost everything we collectively (I mostly) have provided for our baby.  She did this under the guise of “needing space” and it being “temporary” but the actions and way she went about this don’t give me reassurance.  She seems to be all over the place emotionally and if I so much as mention that (out of concern, not criticism), while I/we certainly have issues, postpartum feelings may be amplifying or intensifying the negative feelings towards me, she flat out scoffs in my face that she’s “fine.”  The thing is I’ve known her long enough to see that she’s anything but fine.  She under eats, doesn’t get good sleep, has given up on her appearance (not that I personally care, but that’s something she prides herself deeply on), quit working out or trying (once again, not a mandate from me, but something she was so absorbed with throughout the pregnancy and right after the birth- getting back on that horse).  She even started drinking nightly 5 months postpartum, which we’ve never done as long as I’ve known her.  When I delicately asked “is this a thing now” she snapped at me as if I was blowing it all out of proportion.  It’s at the point where if I have any concern and voice it, even trying to be as tactful as possible, I’m met with flat out denial/refusal to see that something is off.

This also isn’t a situation where she’s carrying the load, although it seems like she feels that way.  I do all cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, and am extremely hands on with the kids (I do virtually all tasks pertaining to my older and split many of the baby tasks).  I’ve always told her to ask for help if she needs a break but she never once has.  Something else strange that started happening is every time I’d take our baby to the changing station to change her, my gf would be standing over my shoulder, and by the time I’m putting the clean diaper on, she’s putting her hands in and taking over the task (4 hands for one diaper is too many cooks in the kitchen).  I don’t understand if this is a trust in my parenting abilities issue but I’m confused by it and have even asked why she does that as I have it under control.  Not sure if this is a maternal instinct or if I’m over analyzing but it’s happened probably a dozen times.

I’m worried that she’s now making rash decisions in the midst of an already extremely difficult time and I have no idea what to do.  She’s now living alone in a run down house compared to our house we bought together and built our life in, leaving me and my daughter (effectively her step daughter- even calls her “mom”) behind very confused.  I can own my part in frustration and not handling the sudden change in her demeanor and sudden non-communication well, but I can’t help but feel like this “one month of space” is really just a protracted break up.  Can I save this? Or it best to focus on my new reality bc fighting/working towards reconciliation/healing only a lost cause?  Any advice would be extremely appreciated.
 
UPDATE: She has fully moved out which is painful but the hard part for me that I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to wrap my head around is that I’ve been positioned as an adversary/antagonist.  Sucks that you can provide and give without getting in return only to be thrown under the bus but maybe there’s a lesson in there for me somewhere, not clear what that is.",
I have a 6 month old baby. My husband is the most non supporting husband. He shows no emotions. He never helps out around the house (I work from home and take care of the baby) or has even changed our babies diaper. I agreed to do it all when we decided to have him. I’m struggling with postpartum depression and he just thinks mental health is a joke. I hate to get a divorce but every day makes me think I will be better off because I feel like a single mom anyway. ,
"Hi I’m a new mum. My son is 10 weeks old. My partner works from home. But despite that, I hardly see him. He can be in meetings a lot in the day. Atm I have my son from 8am-8pm solely and I’m mostly upstairs all day so our son doesn’t interfere with his meetings. The only time I come downstairs is when the baby manages to stay asleep in a sling so I can wash bottles and stuff. I’m currently find it very isolating. He does come upstairs on a lunch break after he’s eaten, which will be for about 20 mins. I know a lot of new mums don’t even get that. I also get everything prepared for the night shift and get a pump in after 8. So I have about 30 mins of alone time before bed. I also do every night shift. My partner was taking turns with me initially, but broken sleep even for one night was really effecting his mental health. I feel really drained and isolated. I’m wondering how other peopled coped.",
"Hello,

I'm a mom of a toddler and a newborn, and I’m hoping to find some solidarity here. My situation seems a bit different from what I often read about—my toddler has been downright mean and distant towards me since our newborn came home. I know the more common challenge is toddlers being aggressive toward the new baby, but my toddler’s aggression is all directed at me. He isn’t acting out toward the baby or his dad—just me.

I’m a stay-at-home mom and was with him 24/7 before the baby arrived. He always favored me and would only want me for everything—whether it was getting a snack or being taken out of his highchair, it was always ""Mommy."" Since the baby came, though, he acts like I’m invisible. He screams “no” at me, won’t make eye contact, hits me, and just seems to want nothing to do with me.

I’m breastfeeding, and my newborn cluster feeds a lot, so she’s on me constantly. As a result, my husband has taken over a lot of the toddler duties, and I’m still recovering from a C-section. I’ve been doing everything I can think of to make my toddler feel special—scheduling one-on-one time with him every day, involving him in helping with the baby, explaining what’s going on, and trying to reassure him. But nothing seems to be working. 

I know this is likely his way of processing the change, and I understand he’s hurt, but it still hurts me deeply. I’m trying to stay strong in front of him, but it’s really hard. It feels so isolating, and I just need to hear from anyone who’s been through this. I feel like I'm the only one experiencing this, and the emotional toll is tough—especially with postpartum feelings in the mix.

Please, no negative comments. I’m already struggling, and I could really use some support from others who’ve been through something similar.

Thank you.

"Has anyone had any luck getting your doctor to write you off work longer than the usual 6-8 weeks due to your PPD?

Idk honestly I feel like I’m falling into my depression again idk if it’s cause I’m on my period or what I’ve cried so much since I’ve been home I’m so overwhelmed and overstimulated my whole body hurts I worked 9-5 to come home and take care of my two year old and she kept fighting what I fed her only ate a couple of nuggets I’m stressing about bills and not making enough and my daughter 2nd birthday is tomorrow but I just feel so sad like I’m a bad mom right now I kept yelling at her today cause she kept fighting her food and then throwing the food on the floor I had to let her play while I had a moment in my room to sit in the dark to get myself together I really didn’t want to yell at her but I did cause she kept throwing tantrums and i hated it I ended up punching my wall in my room (baby was playing in living room) cause I was so frustrated and felt so much strong emotions and it took a while to go away I’m just so tired and exhausted mentally and physically and I’m stressed about money cause our landlord keeps threatening to kick us out if we continue being late I don’t make much but I always send her the full amount in the same month but still I just feel like a shit mom I feel like I can be doing better but mentally I can’t right now ,
"7 months postpartum and I think I have PPD, called my doctor so I'll be seeing them next week but I never realized how alone I felt until now.

I've tried to go back to something of my ""normal self"" and I think I'm finally realizing I'm not going to be able to go back to being her.. I love being a mom and I love my baby so much. I just can't believe I have to let go of who I used to be.

Before I found out I was pregnant, my life was going pretty well. I had accomplished quite a lot for my career, and it started taking off. Then I found out I was pregnant. Just when I thought I figured everything out, I found out I gotta take care of someone else. I didn't have an easy pregnancy, with a lot of health complications. Then my birth was traumatic and now I'm left with a husk of my former self.

I'm scared that I'll never find myself again. That I'll just be a mom. My husband doesn't seem to understand that, when I tell him I ""have nothing"". I really mean it. If someone were to ask me what I liked doing, I don't think I could really answer that. 

I'm just wondering when will this feeling go away? Will I ever find myself again? I feel like I don't even have time to think because my baby constantly cries if I don't feed him or I don't put him to bed. My husband tries but he'll cry his head off until I pick him up. I have to constantly pump milk and wake up in the middle of the night to do too. 

The only time I get to go out is groceries or just errands. I never get to have fun. 

It just seems like I'm not allowed to be me anymore...

I don't know what I'm looking for exactly with posting this, I guess just somewhere  to vent. :/",
"First wanna start off by saying baby is fine nothing has happened. Second wanna ask for no conspiracy theriost in the comments talking about what they think causes it , i just need a safe space to rant and talk about my fear, taking this back to my first child i had an ungodly fear of sids so badly it caused me to go into postpartum depression and almost postpartum pyschosis, i was so scared of losing him i didnt sleep for months and because of sleep depervation became very detached from him and everything else, i was extremely sick mentally it took him being 1 1/2 for me to finally relax, well fast foward i started doing really good mentally and got pregnant with baby #2. I thought since everything ended up okay with my first born id be more reassured this time that and i have help from my family this time in case i need naps , mental health time etc. but here i am 5 days postpartum and have only allowed myself to sleep for 12 hours since shes been born, i can feel myself sinking again and i know i know talk to my doctor and get help which i will. But i cant help but feel this fear will not go away. Im so upset with myself i thought this time it would be easier and i would be okay , i want to be like the moms that can ""sleep when baby sleeps"" i dont understand why i cant be as strong minded as them Or why i cant be normal and just trust that things will be okay. idk , i know this is alot of babbling so if you read this thanks. I just needed to get this off my chest cause no one here understands , my husband has so much faith everything will be just fine and so does my mom she reassures me im doing everything right when it comes to safe sleep and how in her"" day"" this wasnt even something talked about so the fact that im trying to be safe is what matters which is nice but again since in ""her day"" they didnt worry about this she cant understand my fear and either can my husband :/. I feel like a lunatic and its draining me horribly",
"I am almost 4 months postpartum and I’ve been experiencing rage more than ever before. I had a decently relaxed birth other than hemorrhaging after I delivered. I love my daughter more than anything in the world and have never questioned my bond with her. The rage comes in more with my husband, who is overall a great partner. I really hate his mom, who just tries to help but in doing that oversteps boundaries. She came to the hospital uninvited and was upset they kicked her out of the room due to my medical emergency. She did not once ask how I was doing and still has never asked about me. My husband and I have talked about this and he regrets not standing up for me in these moments but playing devils advocate, we are new parents and everything was happening so quickly. He has really shown so much grace and understanding with my issues with his mom and has not pushed me. But every time he goes to see her with our daughter I get ANGRY. Like could do harm angry. And it’ll stick for days and days. I’ll ignore him because I’m so upset and that’s not fair. I have also been depressed. Not like I don’t feel like myself, but more I know this is the new me and is this what I want for the rest of my life.
Again I LOVE my baby. I wouldn’t trade her for anything. But I am 22 and it’s very hard to think how my whole life is different. My husband is 32 so this is a pretty normal age for him to have kids. Also please don’t make this an age gap issue, it’s not at all. I wasn’t forced to have a baby and trapped in anyway, I think it’s normal to miss your old self and what could have been. 
I am breastfeeding and I do love it, but I think my mood has been the cause of my supply being low and that makes me feel worse. Does anyone have any tips on how to get through this? I go to therapy once a week, I try doing stretches (not so much exercise because burning calories can decrease my milk supply), and I do work part time so I have some “adult time” away from home.

I don’t want to be around a bunch of happy people. I don’t want to be around my sisters in law. I know they say relationships are supposed to help you with depression, but I don’t feel like we were really close to begin with. So not going to a wedding wouldn’t be a big deal. The wedding’s not about me anyways so I doubt it would that big of a fuss. 
I’m looking at pricing cosmetic dental work for veneers for maybe sometime this summer. I mentioned it to my husband and he said sure, let me know how much and we’ll save some money and get it done. Part of me just wants to tell him don’t bother because I won’t be here. I can’t think about the future in weeks or months and years totally freaks me out. My chest gets tight and I feel like my heart is racing if anyone talks about the future. 
I was with a group of friends and they all were talking about their travels and how they all went to this one spa and how nice it was. But not me. I’m a SAHM and probably will never go because it’s so expensive and it’s a three hour drive. My husband talks about travel and further plans but I know that won’t happen because we have a one year old. We have other kids too, but I will be tied down for an additional 18 years with her. I’m 45. 
I just hate where I am right now and there’s nothing I can do to change it. I saw an ad on a facebook group for a wfh job. I sent an email, did some texts, and an interview. It was all a scam. I opened a bank account with our bank and because of the fraudulent checks I tried to deposit they put my husband’s deposit on hold. So we can’t even use our checking account this week. All because I tried to get a job. I can’t even do that right. And my resumé was pathetic. 

And why should I be asking my husband for cosmetic things when I don’t work and I can’t even survive on my own. I wouldn’t know how to lease a car, make a resume, or apply for an apartment. I have no money of my own and no skills other than taking care of kids. 

I’m only writing this here because I don’t want to tell my husband. He’s heard it all before and I know he is tired of hearing me complain about my life. I know we have it good because all our needs are taken care of. I feel so lame for being so unhappy. ",
"
I have a 10 day old with my husband. I have 3 other children. He adores them. However, our marriage hasn’t always been good, honest, or even full of love. It’s been rough, and a challenge. 

He has a dog who stays in the crate in the garage of our home (renting) 24/7.. minus when the dog goes to its section of the backyard. The dog howls and barks CONSTANTLY. We have gotten 2 complaints, and the HOA is fining us for the next complaint, and will require the dog be removed after. 

I don’t like the dog. I wish he didn’t have the dog. But he won’t get rid of it. I do not deal with the dog because the dog has attacked my other children, and is very aggressive. That’s why it’s no longer inside the home. He will yell at her constantly to shut up, and when he’s not home, all she does is bark and howl. 

I feel alone because he has only ever changed one diaper, and sleeps through our son’s cries. I had a traumatic c-section. One where I severely hemorrhaged for 2 days following and required multiple transfusions. I have been at home by myself all day taking care of the baby, doing laundry, cleaning, taking care of other children. When he gets home from work, I clean up after him, and am up all night with the baby. I haven’t slept more than 2 hours a night since our son has been born. Husband sleeps right through his cries and is not much help at all. 

I just went almost 3 days without eating, and don’t have much money left in my savings. I went to order food so I can eat, and he told me to get him something. Surely I didn’t have to, but I did. Well, half way through me trying to eat, the baby woke up and needed my milk. So, here I am at the table, juggling a BF baby, a toddler stealing my food, and a husband who is now more worried about the dog. 

I ate half my meal. Then I tried putting toddler to sleep while double-checking chores are done. 

He went to bed. I’m at the point where I think I want to leave. I feel alone. I feel so much hate for how my body looks right now. (I was in great shape prior to this pregnancy.) I have no support- no family, no friends. No me time. I hate my husband now, I’m repulsed by him. I’ve cried every day since our son was born. ",
"Hi all,

I gave birth a week ago to my beautiful girl but my delivery was nothing but smooth and I keep having flashbacks from it.

I got an infection due to my water being broken which led to fever, nausea etc, then the hospital gave me antibiotics to help which I ended up being allergic to... basically I had to push my baby out while on 2 IV drips of benadryl trying not to pass out. After the delivery the nurse gave me medication to stop the bleeding which spiked my fever again to 40 degrees and I started throwing up uncontrollably, the hardest part was that I couldn't even hold my baby for hours and I was feeling delirious from all the meds they have me... the whole ordeal was so traumatic and I am just expected to move on and take care of my newborn right away, it just seems too much ...

I love my beautiful girl but I keep missing the times I had with my partner alone and just simply being a girl who doesn't have to be responsible for someone... I don't even know how to describe it but I just feel sad thinking of before",
"Did anyone else experience puffy face with their first period after pp? I think I may be dealing with this, I loathe weight at first and now it looks like I’m gaining it again and I’m not sure if it’s the bloating from the period but I feel super insecure and hate my body again. Any recommendations? I’ve been trying affirmations but it just isn’t cutting it. :( this was my body before pregnancy and then after ",
"Hi my fiance came to me about 3 weeks ago and said she wasn’t happy with our relationship. Asking her what she wasn’t happy with she said “I don’t know I can’t describe it” and so I tried doing as much as I could trying new things,date night ,watching the baby more. Nothing seemed to work then she started staying at her parents more often and would go hang out with friends then she would say she wants to break up and needs to be alone and hopefully can get back to us and the baby. Fast forward to now the obgyn just told her that her symptoms were ppd and this is about 8 months after birth. They prescribed antidepressant and cbd and the cbd does seem to help for about an hour with her anxiety from it. She’s fine around me but once she goes out by herself or hangs out with friends she says she can’t be with me anymore and she needs to be alone and work on herself. There’s much more I’m probably forgetting but now she wants to get an apartment for herself to work on herself. Any help is appreciated I don’t know what to do I’m trying my best having the baby full time. ",
"        I (22 F) am 3 months postpartum with my only kid. The father is not involved, so I'm raising my son alone, and I love him so much, but it has been a steep learning curve. I knew I was at a high risk for developing post partum depression (PPD) because I've been struggling with depression for the past 11 years at least. I had managed to get it under control, and got to the point where I thought I was ready to go off my meds when I found out I was pregnant, and decided not to mess with my medication for the time being. Due to my experience with depression, I recognized the signs of things getting bad agin, and acted quickly to get myself to a more stable point again. Here is the problem though, I live at home with my mom and step dad, and I feel like he rarely has anything nice to say to me since I gave birth.
         For context, my step dad and I have always had a slightly rocky relationship. I was abused by my bio dad growing up, and therefore had trust issues in regards to new men entering my life. However, my step dad, who I usually refer to as my real dad, was patient and won me over with time. I grew to trust him, but we still have clashing personalities and different ways of expressing ourselves, which often leads to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. We had gotten pretty close, and even talked about getting matching tattoos, because despite our disagreements, we still loved each other very much. I love my dad, and I know he loves his grandson, but lately it feels like he doesn't like me at all. 
        Ever since my son was born, it feels like my dad doesn't have anything nice to say to me unless he's called out for being rude. He questions everything I do in regards to my son, and frequently gives me conflicting critiques. For example, if I go and grab my son as soon as he cries, I'm called an over bearing helicopter mom, but if I let him cry for a bit at a time that's inconvenient for my dad, like when hes watching tv, then he acts like I'm being neglectful. 
          One time, he chewed me out for not having all of the baby's bottles washed at the time, and instead washing one as I needed it. He got really fired up about this, and his tone made it seem like I was neglecting my baby. I could go on, but I'd be here all day. 
        He doesn't even seem interested in talking to me anymore. I ask him how his day was, and get vague, one word answers. I try to tell him jokes, or tell him about my day, or something I read, and he doesn't respond at all. Sometimes there are nice moments where things between us feel the way they used to, but they are often fleeting, and far between. 
           I can't tell if I'm being dramatic, or over thinking things though. I admit that my past traumas still tend to cloud my judgment when it comes to my dad, even after years of therapy, and I don't feel like I'm in the right state of mind these days. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to keep it together for the sake of my son, and I make sure he's well taken care of. He's one of the only things that makes me smile these days, and I love him so much. He's very happy, and healthy, and he smiles so big whenever he sees me, which let's me know I'm doing a good job as a mom, even when my dad makes me doubt that.
        I would like to talk to my mom about it, but her and I don't get much time alone these days, and I don't want to cause tension between her and my dad, especially if I'm just over reacting. Her and I are incredibly close, and have only gotten closer since I got pregnant. I think she would listen to me, and be supportive, but I don't want her to feel like she's caught between me and her husband.
           Honestly, I don't know what I'm hoping for here, I guess I just needed to vent, and feel like I don't have much of another outlet right now. Maybe I need some impartial advice, or just someone to tell me if I'm being dramatic or not. Thank you for anyone who read this far, I appreciate the ability to just get this all off of my chest.

UPDATE
           No one has asked for an update, but for the sake of getting everything off my chest I wanted to write one anyway. 
          I managed to find the time to talk to my mom, and first asked her if she's also noticed my dad's behavior, and she immediately confirmed that she had. This was both a relief and a disappointment, because it meant that I wasn't imagining things, but also meant that I was right about my dad not being very nice to me. My mom suggested that I talk to him and figure out what's going on, which isn't bad advice.
          The main reason I hadn't talked to my dad about it to start off with is he's not the easiest to talk to about stuff like this. He can get very defensive and stubborn, and if he feels like he's being targeted he simply shuts down and is no longer willing to hear anything I have to say. I can be the same way sometimes, which is part of where he and I end up butting heads, but I'm trying to do better. I've spent years learning those to best communicate with my dad to avoid the shut down, but the majority of my energy is going towards caring for my son, so I didn't feel like I had the energy to carefully talk with him. However, I didn't feel it was fair of me to just sit there being upset with him without talking to him about it.
         Before I got the chance though, my dad asked me about it himself. My mom had told him about what I said, which I knew she was likely to do. My mom tells my dad everything unless I ask her not to, which I honestly don't mind, and sometimes actually hope for. My dad asked why I thought he didn't like me, and I was honest and said that while we were in a good spot recently, he hadn't been very nice to me as of late.
          My dad told me that a lot of it is do to stress over things like money, and feeling like I'm taking advantage of him. I work nights so I'm home with my kid during the day, and my parents watch him at night. I thought this arrangement was working fine, but my dad wanted me to put my son in daycare. I explained that I didn't really feel comfortable with putting my baby in a daycare, and my dad was very dismissive. 
            Personally I think the whole stressed out excuse is nonsense. I'm dealing with the stresses of being a new, single mom, who's still trying to work full-time, and I haven't taken it out on anyone. The whole money things seems like a bit of an excuse to me too, especially because I've offered multiple times to help out. I acknowledge that I have a lot more disposable income than them since I'm living at home, and have said multiple times that I'm happy to help with things like bills and groceries. It's only once in a blue moon that they ask me to pay for something, and I've never said no so far. I get that they probably see this as not my problem, because I'm still considered one of the kids, but I am and adult, with a job so if they're stressed enough that my dad isn't treating me well, they should ask me for help more.
            Either way it seems to have gotten better. My dad has been treating me better, and while I do think his reason is a little ridiculous, it is nice to have an explanation for his behavior. 
           Thank you to those who commented and left suggestions. I knew that being a mom was going to be a challenge, but I wasn't prepared for this kind of conflict with my dad. It seems to be working out in the end though. ",
"Hey all. 

I kind of just need to vent a little if that's okay. A lot of people in our life have never really been apart of PPD and this is my first time, but, all that's being said to my wife is 'it's okay' or 'it will get better'. Now, I'm definitely apart of this group, but, hearing my wife cry dozen+ times a day about not being a good mom, or no bond with the baby, or she made a mistake is taking a toll. 

My wife and I struggled so hard to get here. Couldn't conceive naturally and went through IUI and then IVF. One egg and one sperm ended up working and creating our little miracle - Nemo, as we called them through pregnancy. We didn't want to know gender until delivery and when he was born, my wife went through almost 29 hours of labor and needed a C-section because his heartrate was dipping (found out the umbilical cord was around his body like a sash). 

She developed her PPD in hospital, roughly 2 days after my son's birth. It's been about 2 weeks since, and, everyday is the same. I feel awful for my wife because she is so loving and caring and has the ability to be a great mom. But, her PPD is blinding her to this reality. 

And it's hard hearing my wife like this especially when our baby is healthy. We do have a big support system that's helping us through this, but, it's still a lot. We have talked to her OB and they changed her meds and talked about trying to get her on Zurzuvae. She's talked to a therapist and will talk to them more over the coming weeks. 

I'm not sure if I am looking for advice or anything, but, venting is good. 

Thank you for reading if you have",
"I thought I had gotten lucky and wasn’t going to get hit by ppd. I’ve been on depression meds for awhile, so I thought they were taking care of anything I could be feeling. 
I’ve seen a lot of people in this sub say they have a hard time bonding with their baby or they just don’t love them. I love my baby more than life itself. The further I get into postpartum though, the more I hate myself. 

My birth didn’t go as expected at all. I was trying to have a natural, unmediated birth. I came to terms with needing the epidural. I wasn’t dilating and the epidural wasn’t working currently for me either. So, at 3am, they rushed me back to the OR because I needed an emergency c-section since my baby started to not tolerate the contractions. During my c-section, I lost a lot of blood and kept passing out. My hemoglobin was under 7, but they didn’t want to give me blood after my c-section because I’m “young and healthy.” So, my body failed me by not dilating as it should. 
I planned on exclusively breastfeeding, but my baby lost 13% of his body weight because I wasn’t producing enough. So, my body failed me again. 

I’m snapping at my husband. I can’t sleep when the baby is sleeping because I feel like I’m failing as a mother and a wife. I want him to have the best life possible, but I just can’t get it together. 
I have to go back to school tomorrow because it’s my last semester of nursing school. The thought of leaving him makes me sick. 

I just feel like maybe my husband and baby would be better with me because all I’ve done is fail them. 


I’m calling my OB in the morning to ask for a higher dose of depression meds, but I’m open to other advice as well. ",
"It’s been a year now and I’m still struggling with depression. I feel like my life isn’t my own anymore and I’m just a slave to my family. I have to do all the things to keep the house running. I still haven’t figured out what will make me happy and just about every day I think about death. I’ve been dreading these days since the fall. So much has happened. I survived Thanksgiving and my husband says cheerfully, “see, we did thanksgiving so you’ll make it through Christmas.”  I interpret that as see, everything is fine and you’re worrying about nothing. 
In the beginning of December my 13 yo daughter was admitted to the ER for self harm. She then went to a mental health hospital for about 3 weeks. She came home the first week of January. It was scary and sad and we had family counseling sessions with her therapist. I felt like I could have been in my daughter’s place. They were talking to her about anxiety and what she needs to do to overcome it. What are the steps? What is your plan, etc. Take self care days, journal your feelings… I told my husband I felt like such a hypocrite being there. How am I supposed to help her when I can’t help myself? 
My husband and I have had a few arguments. I don’t do things for him that show him love. He likes to see me naked and physical affection is his way of being loved. We haven’t had sex for over a year now. It was partly do to the last weeks of my pregnancy, post partum, and then my fear of getting pregnant. I had a hysterectomy in the middle of December so no sex from that. I’m uneasy about having sex with him again. It’s a lot of things that go into that. 
I feel like Christmas for me and the kids didn’t go so well. I told him I wasn’t doing Christmas but I still bought candy, stocking stuffers, and a few gifts for the kids. I did the bare minimum and he dropped the ball on stocking stuffers for me, one of the kids, and a few gifts for some of the kids. 
Then my birthday came up and he planned a dinner for me at a restaurant and invited two couples we know from church. One couple I like, the other I didn’t. The husband of the second couple is one of his good friends that recently got married for the third time. He is a nice man and his wife is nice enough, but I didn’t want them at my birthday dinner. I barely know her and have only spoken to her maybe three times. 
And then… everyone at the table had degrees, jobs, travel adventures and I don’t have a degree, a job, or have traveled the world let alone gone to the spa that is an hour outside of town.  Everyone had been to that spa but me. My husband tried to gift me a spa gift certificate there but in a really lame way. He said, “I’d like to get you a spa gift certificate for “that place” but I don’t know what you want to do there.”  
He knows I would have to get child care bc I don’t know when he would be working (he’s an airline pilot.) He’s done several things like that- suggested a gift that he wants to get me that needs to be scheduled but then doesn’t do it.  
So my birthday came, and then he went hunting for 5 days with our older sons and a bunch of other guys. He sent pictures of what they were doing and it seemed like a nice mini vacation for him. Meanwhile I am at home with the teen girls, the 10 yo, and the five little people. We were fine and nothing major happened but it wasn’t the greatest. He says he wants to take me to the hunting place during the summer. I’m not counting on it.  
I have since stopped going to my regular therapist bc I don’t feel like I was making much progress. He validated my feelings but really didn’t give me any insights or tools to get better. I’ve been finding things online from instagram and pinterest. My husband arranged for us to talk to our pastor and that was a disaster. He was asking about my family of origin and then asked “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” 
I can’t even see myself in one month! I wish I was dead by then or had a cancer diagnosis. But no, I’ll probably still be a SAHM with a 5 yr old and 10 yr old twins, and a teen. 
Still the mom, still the cook cleaner, and driver and everything else my husband wants me to be so he can go and do his thing of having a career and meeting people. I keep telling him that he needs to find a better wife. One who is smarter, prettier, happier and that wants to be there with him and all these kids. One who is intellectual and wants to play his card games
I know I’m not happy and I know I am depressed and I don’t want to be here. I’m not who he needs. 
We have a wedding to attend in February and I really don’t want to go. But he says I have to go. I don’t want to go bc I don’t want to see his family. And I don’t want to have to plan everyone’s suitcase and such. We have to travel 5 hours away for it and I just don’t want to go. 
This is just a rant. I don’t think anyone can help me. I don’t want any advice bc I’ve heard it all before. I just had to get my feelings out from this weekend. 
",
"For what it's worth, I don't feel I had a particularly traumatic birth which makes me feel silly for saying I'm dealing with birth trauma, but I don't know what else to call it. I had a pretty straightforward, quick-ish (about 12 hours) vaginal birth and although there was some pretty bad tearing, I had an epidural and didn't even feel it happening. 

I just keep finding myself flashing back to being on that hospital bed in the delivery room, trying to push, everyone focused on me and yelling out instructions and reassurances. The level of exposure and vulnerability that comes with giving birth leaves me with a skin-crawling type of feeliing every time I think about it. My heart starts racing, it gets hard to breathe, and I find it difficult to focus on caring for my little girl. 

Does anyone have any advice or coping skills they've found helpful when these flashbacks hit? I am currently seeing a therapist and am going to call a doctor tomorrow to see about medication, but I'm hoping there's something I can do in the meantime. I feel like it's affecting my bond with my baby and my relationship with my husband. 

Any advice or even just sharing your own stories (if you're comfortable) would be very helpful ❤️",
"My wife gave birth to a boy 10 days back..me and her parents and my parents are here for her. But she is struggling with her post partum.

She is unreasonably scared and tensed of random things.
She is scared something will happen to her parents.
There was an instance of hallucination.
She is crying all the time.
She cannot sleep. Yesterday she slept for maybe an hour.
She has cramps and pain which is harder because of the cough she had.
She sometimes speaks like she is unhinged.

"I am crying as I write this. I feel so bad for my baby. I have a gorgeous baby girl and I just don’t feel any love towards her. I find her stressful and her presence inconvenient. I wish I never had a baby to begin with. It’s not about her, I just don’t think I’m fit to be a mother. It’s been 9 weeks. Sometimes we make progress but on days like today I feel like I’m on square 1. She deserves to be loved by her mother. Idk if I should her give up for adoption, but everyone else in my family loves her so much they practically can’t go more than a day without her, and that includes my wife. My wife would die if we gave the baby up, so I don’t think that’s an option. I don’t worry when she’s with other people. I’ve heard people say they get PPA so bad they worry about the baby being around other people. I see memes on the internet mentioning that motherhood is stressful but they love their baby and it’s worth it. I feel none of that. I have no problem letting her be with other people, as long as I’m off the hook. I’m extremely apathetic towards her. I have no idea what to do. I feel so stuck and so guilty. ",
"I'm extremely fortunate that I have a job that offers multiple shift patterns. Every year you have to apply to the top 3 patterns you want and you aren't guaranteed to get it, but it's still so nice to have the option.

When I returned from maternity leave in October of 2023, I went straight onto a Monday to Friday pattern. I applied to keep the pattern for 2024 and got it. It was nice because you get holidays and weekends off. I never had to worry about missing family events or my older kid's dance competitions.

But as the year went on, I deteriorated. Wake up, drive the kids to daycare, go to work, pick the kids up, dinner, bath, bed. Every day I got MAX 2 hours to myself. Which wasn't even really to myself because then my husband wanted attention and would get annoyed if I just wanted to scroll on my phone and veg out. I had literally zero waking moments 100% to myself to do what I wanted to do. I would get so fucking angry when people at work were like ""happy Friday!"" because I knew that my weekend was just going to be non stop chores and taking care of kids and continuing to get zero time to myself.

I had non stop fantasies about killing myself. I was barely eating or sleeping anymore. By the end of the year, I lost about 20-30lbs and had to tighten my belt to the smallest it could go. I would scare myself driving to and from work because I felt like I was physically holding myself back from crashing my car. 

After battling back and forth with myself, I decided to go back on shift work. I applied for a 4 on, 5 off position. That means two 12 hour days, two 12 hour nights, and then I get 5 days off. It was a hard decision to make because it meant working weekends and holidays and my husband would have to pick up a lot of the slack and I just felt selfish. But we're just under a month into the year, and I already feel like a weight has been lifted.

On my days off, I have enough time to get the chores done without kids hanging off of me and still plenty of time to just relax and do my own thing. Today, I was playing with my two year old and I was actually smiling and having fun. Maybe this sounds awful, but it's like working 4 days where I either don't see them at all or barely see them, makes me actually miss them and want to spend time with them. I don't feel burnt out. I don't feel like I want to kill myself. I actually feel happy.",
"Hey everyone,

I created a Discord community for moms in all stages of the postpartum journey—whether you’re 6 weeks in or 6 years—and I’d love for you to join us.

This isn’t just another group; it’s a safe space where we can talk about the hard stuff: mental health, the postpartum experience, and the realities that don’t make it into the parenting books. It’s a place to vent, seek advice, join weekly/monthly mental health activities, and find genuine support from people who get it.

Postpartum mental health is often overlooked, and too many of us suffer in silence. Let’s change that. Together, we can create a village that uplifts and supports each other.

If this sounds like what you need—or if you just want to check it out—the link is below.

Hope to see you there �

"Hello everyone,

Long story short, I went through some fertility trauma/pregnancy loss late 2021, early 2022. I took a year off from trying to get my ""mind right"". I initially went through a deep wave of anxiety/depression for a month before it spiraled into these constant unwanted suicidal thoughts and images. At first, I thought I was having a near psychotic break because I never felt these feelings before, and they were constant. I tried Zoloft, and clomipramine, and they really didn't do anything for me. Prior to this fertility stuff, I was fortunate enough to never really experience anxiety or depression.

Long story short, over the years, they are still present, some days worse than others, but always there. I welcomed my double rainbow baby in late 2023, and was hoping they would stop but never really did. I decided to stop taking all meds due to great amount of weight gain and no real mental relief/benefits.

Over the last few months, I seem to have some struggles fertility wise again as things really aren't going my way with regards to it, however: I have been sleeping better and have had some really mentally calm downs. And now this week, they are really bad again. I love my family, I love my life, and I fear so badly that I will act on it one day out of feelings of hopelessness of never feeling better. I have normal energy, I try to work out and eat healthy every day, I go to work every day, I don't do any recreational drugs, and I rarely ever dink anymore.

Thoughts? I would love for these thoughts to just stop.",
"My son studies my feet as we walk hand and finger through the hallways of our home, and it occurs to me to tell you—you will be OK.

It occurs to me that I should tell you from one mom to another. You will be OK even though now you are not OK, and it’s OK to not be OK.

Even though being OK seems a long way off and nigh impossible. Even still, you will be more than just OK. 

My son babbles something in an intelligible language. 

You will in fact be great.

Sooner than you think, the haze of newborn days will be behind you. Your child will cuddle and clap and stand and dance and laugh. He will conversationally mutter “up, up, up,” while holding your hand as you walk about the halls of your own home because it’s much too cold to go play outside like he really wants to.

It baffles me how one can go from being so very not OK to being more OK than they’ve ever been in the short span of a year, but trust me when I say—you will get there. 

Perhaps it will take longer—perhaps a shorter time—but there will come a day when you realize your hours are far more full of laughter than of tears, and in fact, you don’t remember the last time you cried in anything but joy.

The little hand that grips yours now by reflex will hold it out of trust. The voice that wails for you in the middle of the night will still wail for you in the middle of the night, but now you will know exactly what to do to calm it, and you will feel capable—not overwhelmed.

You will grow to be so much stronger than you ever dreamed you could be, and all for the love of a little person who looks to you as their everything when they are in fact YOUR everything.

You will want time to neither rush nor slow because you are so happy right where and when you are.

My son cruises around the coffee table and takes two brave, wobbly steps towards the couch.

You will know that these are the best days of your lives.


Don’t be ashamed to need help getting here. It’s so much more beautiful on the other side. ❤️ I wish I could send this letter back to the me I was 11 months ago. ",
"PPD hit me like a train at around 5 months and got worse and worse until I literally feel each day that I’m hanging by a thread. That thread is my son who needs me more than anyone else does and I have to stay here for him, even though I picked out exactly how and where I would die. I can’t give up. It’s been so hard to keep myself together and it’s everything I can do to keep going to work every day and doing the things that I need to do. 

I feel like I’m failing at work and I’m failing at home and at my relationships with everyone including my partner. I feel like my son deserves much better than me but for him I try the hardest. At work I have told my boss how overwhelmed I feel. I lead a team of 14 people and that is an intense amount of direct reports, 3 of which need constant support as they are new in their positions. Yesterday I sent an email to my boss detailing that I need help managing my workload and developing better skills so that I can be better on top of things, I confided in her that I was being treated for PPD. She didn’t respond to my email. 

My bosses, bosses, boss, the leader of the facility that I work in came into my office and sat down and probably gave me most healing and understanding talk that I’d ever had. I don’t really know him, though we’ve worked around each other and I’ve worked indirectly for him for many years. He sat and he told me all about how much his partner struggled post partum, how she had PPD and PPR and how they didn’t take it seriously at first. He told me that everyone around me understands the massive change my body went through and no one thinks that I’m a failure for struggling. He said work should shape around my life and the most important thing was to care for myself. He said he couldn’t tell me how to get through the next 6 months, but that I was doing the right things by seeking treatment. It all meant a lot to me. I was apprehensive about reaching out to my boss because she’s always warned about being careful about optics. Reputation, how you look and how your leaders see you, all that is vitally important in the corporate setting. 

Not sure where I am going with this. Just sharing somewhere because I have so few people I can share with. This thing is so isolating, I feel paralyzed to reach out to anyone. It makes you believe that no one cares and everyone is frustrated when you aren’t yourself and maybe can’t do as much for them. But I think more people care than I know and they’d want to help if I just had the courage to reach out. 

Thanks for reading if you took the time to do so ",
"progesterone levels are high during pregnancy coming from the placenta and after birth this production drops off a big amount. but some women might not produce progesterone well as a standard without the placenta support. when estrogen is relatively too high it creates vulnerability to stress (causes higher activity in the amygdala part of the brain) [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14569273/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14569273/)

A lot of women use progesterone post menopause to help symptoms. Getting a boost of bioidentical progesterone again (not the synthetic type progestins) might be worth a test to see if it helps postpartum

Someone here posted it worked very well for them in days , so it might have a helpful effect at least for a decent % of women [https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum\_Depression/comments/18rpct3/please\_please\_read\_if\_youre\_suffering\_and\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/18rpct3/please_please_read_if_youre_suffering_and_dont/)

*""Under good conditions, the (premenstrual) luteal phase of the monthly cycle resembles pregnancy, as a period of progesterone dominance, in which the abundance of progesterone causes cells to decrease their estrogen content. The luteal phase is actually the first stage of pregnancy,*

*The sudden decrease of progesterone production before menstruation is similar to decrease of hormone production just before childbirth. The same conditions that produce the premenstrual syndrome, if they aren't corrected by the placenta's massive production of progesterone, will produce preeclampsia, toxemia of pregnancy, eclampsia, and postpartum depression. They are also related to the problems that become so common at menopause.*  
*Whenever the production of progesterone falls, tissues are susceptible to estrogen. There are several common causes of a progesterone deficiency. Deficiencies of thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol are often responsible for a progesterone deficiency. Inadequate light exposure can cause it. Excess polyunsaturated fats, interfering with gonads and thyroid, can cause it. And excess serotonin can cause it""* [https://wiki.chadnet.org/files/postpartum-prementstrual-and-seasonal-seotonin-soaks.pdf](https://wiki.chadnet.org/files/postpartum-prementstrual-and-seasonal-seotonin-soaks.pdf)

"I'm 2 months postpartum and I have been diagnosed with postpartum depression. Around 2 weeks after the baby was born, I started to feel a sense of dread every morning and not want to get out of bed. I started to get more anxious and small things were setting me off.

My baby got sick and was admitted to hospital for around 10 days. During this time, I was in the hospital with him and lost interest in eating, personal hygiene became difficult. Everything seemed too difficult, although I was getting more rest in the hospital than I would at home and I only had to feed and change my baby. 

I went into emergency at the same hospital and they diagnosed me with postpartum depression, but I keep feeling like it is not that. After coming home from the hospital, I had a burst of energy and got quite a lot done but I still wasn't interested in eating and personal hygiene was still difficult despite being at home. Whenever the baby cried, I would start shaking and just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. 

Everything feels like there are too many steps and it's too difficult. I have had postpartum depression and anxiety before and it was really bad, but I didn't feel this sense of confusion and slowness that I do this time. 

I haven't cooked in ages, whenever I go into the kitchen I start to feel scared and sometimes my hands shake whenever I'm faced with a task I need to do. I don't want to get out of bed in the mornings. I feel like I can't take on any new task, I can only repeat the things I know from before and a lot of those I can't do anymore. I'm anxious about ordering groceries because I will have to put them away. I'm anxious about putting food into a plate and eating it. When I'm given a plate of food, it feels too difficult to even sit and eat. I'm anxious about ordering diapers and baby clothes and formula. It all feels mentally taxing and draining and I can't explain that to anyone because they would think I'm crazy. I only look forward to sleeping because there's nothing to think about, but once I wake up it all starts again. 

Today my daughter had an accident in the washroom and my hands started shaking, I felt scared and genuinely felt like I did not want to live life anymore. It felt so difficult and I don't know why. 

My ferritin levels were low prior to my c section, but I checked recently and it is now in the fifties. I have been at 7 during pregnancy and I didn't feel this way. 

I feel isolated from everyone and I wonder how people can enjoy anything. I don't enjoy spending time with my kids or anyone else, I don't have much to say and prefer being alone. I feel so much sadness, as if I have lost everything and the person I was is gone. I find it difficult to move from one task to another and feel scared whenever I'm alone with my kids because I'll have to multi task and I can't seem to. I just want to run away from everything.

I was prescribed 50mg Zoloft and I am taking something for sleep too. I'm told the Zoloft hasn't kicked in yet and I have to wait until the two week mark.

I have read stories of postpartum depression and I don't see anybody struggling to function as much as I am right now. I have a family history of psychosis and bipolar, but I don't seem to fit the bill for those either. ",
"I had my daughter 5 months ago and I thought I was dealing with everything really well so far. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for 8 years and been taking medication (Effexor) with good effect. I continued throughout my pregnancy and continue the same dose postpartum. 

The last two weeks I have no idea what’s wrong with me but I just feel so numb. I used to enjoy going to mom and baby groups and now I just feel worthless and like there’s no point in going. My husband works long hours and some days he doesn’t get to see the baby at all. I put her to sleep every night and it takes usually an hour, and then I’m the one waking up with her all night since we co-sleep and I’m breastfeeding. I count down the hours for him to get home just for him to be late. I feel like I never get any breaks, we don’t have family or close friends nearby that I could trust with baby. 

Just tonight I went out with friends and I couldn’t even enjoy myself. I just feel so sad. I’m not sure what to do. I have an appointment with my counsellor in a few weeks but I think I might need to talk to my doctor. I’m upset that I’m going through this. Is this normal to be experiencing this with a later onset? I thought if I was going to be depressed I already would be by now. I love my daughter more than anything and feel so guilty about all the awful thoughts I’m having and how I just feel like she deserves so much better than me as a mother. ",
"I am going insane. Not in a way to hurt my baby, but to hurt myself. But then, I can’t do that because I have a baby that depends on me. I opened up to my partner and he said I was crazy and threatened to take my baby away from me. I went even more crazy… I just want to bang my head against the wall. I don’t know what to do. ",
"How do you cope with negative thoughts that come with post partum depression. My mind keeps going back to how my husband sucks and essentially was selfish and abandoned me when I really needed him. He continues to abandon me by choosing to work a night shift even though I’ve told him I’m struggling and need help. He sleeps all day and I’m alone with the 6 month old and 2 year old. I don’t have family or friends that care. I feel alone, abandoned. I get angry at my husband and family and then I get overwhelmed and angry which spills over to my kids. I get irritable and don’t want to spend time with them because I’m already drained. I feel my husband creates a dark shadow around me. I have already tried to leave him last year but he kept harassing me and all of a sudden was father is the year wanting to see the 2 year old (6 month old wasn’t born yet) and demanding that I drop her off. I was worried he wouldn’t give her back to me so I always went along with the visits and he somehow weasels his way back into my life. Then the cycle repeats and I stupidly got pregnant again and he wanted me to abort the baby. He wasn’t supportive throughout pregnancy and left the childcare and cleaning to me of course while I was still working full time. I’ve been so depressed and tired. Then when the baby was born he sat in the chair and I had to tell him to help me. With both pregnancies I hired a doula to be there for me because I knew he wouldn’t help me. I was correct. He’s a selfish shitty person. I knew the second baby would be hard on my mental health because I knew he would be like this. And so here I am dealing with the consequences of my bad choices in choosing this stupid man. He has childhood trauma and untreated ADHD. He truly lacks empathy and has told me so. He says he only cares about me and that he “likes” the kids. I wonder if he only truly cares about me because he uses me. 

Last night I sent him a series of texts about my thoughts and feelings while he was at work and he basically kept working. I told him I fantasize about the peace that would come with death. He came home and went to sleep. Just further confirms that I’m alone and he’s a piece of shit. I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to my family because they already hate him from last year when I tried to leave him. If I talk to them them I’m just proving to them that I’m unfit to be a parent by staying with him. 

It’s too much effort to deal with him. I can’t rely on him yet I’m trapped with him. He also doesn’t even remember when our kids were born. He literally told me that it wasn’t a big deal to him because it wasn’t happening to him. He said he didn’t really care about the ordeal. I remember when I was in labour he didn’t try to help me. He got mad at me because he was tired. This stuff just plays through my head all the time. ",

"Currently on 25mg of Sertraline, about 10 days now. I’ve been dealing with very severe postpartum anxiety/depression and it’s absolutely consuming my life!!! I’ve noticed I have glimpses of who I once was throughout the day, whereas I was in a state of nonstop panic and crying all day. But today is a hard day. Yesterday was a bit better..but all I want to do is cry and breakdown and the anxiety is awful. I’m so thankful my mother in law and mother came to help me with my toddler.

The anxiety I’m struggling with isn’t even related to anything in particular!! I feel like everyone I see of Reddit have anxiety pertaining their babies…I don’t have any anxiety about my baby, I’m not worried about SIDS or anything to that nature. It’s just a general sense of unease and panic and worry that has no reasoning. It’s just there. And I can’t sleep because of it. I keep doomscrolling Reddit and worry about the future thinking “when am I gonna feel better?? I want to feel better? I want to go to sleep without anxiety. I want to be better for my family”. Did anyone else deal with excess worry anxiety and depression without a direct cause? 

I have great support, my partner is soooo loving and supportive and helpful and I have my mother in law who is also helping with maintaining the toddler, laundry and cooking. I just want to feel normal again. Someone please tell me when it got easier for you guys too…",
"I'm severely depressed and anxious and my psychiatrist says that she believes it's postpartum depression. I've been trying antidepressants and benzos but nothing is helping. I just don't feel connected to my 2 children, 5 yo m and 2 yo m, and I don't think I like being a mom. The 5 yo is very headstrong and he makes life a living hell sometimes and the 2 yo is a good kid but he's a lot of constant work and I just don't have the energy or desire to play with him. Does anyone else feel this way or have any advice?",
Can I use canesten internal cream 1 week postpartum? I had a c section ,
"My employer dropped mental healthcare as part of our insurance plan so what used to be covered at 100% is now not covered at all so I haven’t had a therapist through this round of postpartum and honestly it’s hitting me like a fucking truck. 

I’ve got like 4 more bad days in me before I just abandon my husband and kids and run off to live in the dessert. Although I’d probably need to find one of those spiritual cults that does all the thinking for you because I don’t have any executive function left and would not survive on my own. 

Jokes obviously. But seriously I am running out of ideas. I’ve exhausted all of the skills that I built with my therapist after my first baby but two under two is suffocating me. My husband, who I once adored and thought was the perfect man is suddenly doing everything wrong and I hate him. Even though he is still just as supportive as ever. I love my kids with my whole heart but when I had my second I decided to be at home until they started school but I am so much more overwhelmed than when I was working and being a mom. I feel like I’m such a failure all the time. My relationship is suffering. I’m just so stressed that we took a three day weekend away while mil had the kids and I came back feeling worse. ",
"Last week was one of the worst mental health weeks I’ve had in a long time. I have a 4mo baby and a 5yo, just started working from home, and my baby is going through a sleep regression which I know it making everything worse. I told my husband on Tuesday of last week that it was a rough mental health day and he asked if there was anything he could do. I never know how to answer that when people ask lol. It’s like, no, but yes but I’m not sure what or how? Well anyway, he decided last week he was going to start working out after work and by the time he’s done, it’s dinner time and then bedtime for the girls. So it’s just me handling everything for the kids. I brought it up by the end of the week and he said “I didn’t realize it was that bad. You just handle it really well” and kind of dismissed it. I broke down because what choice do I have?? I told him I’m suffering mentally and life was a lot earlier in the week. I know he’s going through a lot right now with deaths in his family, other family issues, and work, so I didn’t push it any further. 

On top of that, I tried telling my uncle that I’m close with that I wasn’t doing well mentally. His response- “you’d never be able to tell. You’re always so on top of everything”. When I saw my friends last week they asked how me and the girls are. I told them the girls are great but things are a lot right now and I’m kind of going through it. They said “you’re a super mom. I don’t know how you do it every day.” I just want to yell IM NOT AND I CANT THATS WHAT IM TELLING YOU. I feel so dismissed. I’m trying to tell people who care about me that I’m struggling, but I feel like nobody listens unless I will straight up say I’m super depressed and anxious and have really bad thoughts. 

I am seeing a therapist and she was a huge support last week, but it’s not the same. I’m also on medication for PPD and PPA. It just seems like I’ve hit a bump in the road. But when I’m looking for support from the people who seem to care about it, there is no support. It’s not helpful to hear “super mom” and “you handle everything so well” because I’m literally not handling it well!!!! There’s no village anymore. There’s nobody who actually helps when I ask for help and I’m over it. ",
"My baby girl looks exactly like her dad. She is absolutely gorgeous and I’m told this regularly. But, I felt betrayed when I saw her from the moment she was born as she looked nothing like me and her dad and I didn’t work out. He was emotionally abusive and we’re now battling it out legally re custody. 

When I look at her it’s a painful reminder of the trauma associated with that relationship. Any single moms out there? Is this normal? Does the pain fade? ",
"It's like I can't control the tone of my voice anymore. Things that weren't supposed to come out mean come out sounding horrible. My voice sounds flat and uninterested even when I'm enjoying myself. I cry so much. My uncle yelled at me and I started crying and he started yelling at me for crying (he has his own mental issues, but regardless I think I'm done spending time with him for a bit) and I just went and hid so I could cry some more. It feels like I'm always a snide remark or sideways look away from crying or losing my marbles at somebody. None of the meds my doctor has had me try have worked. Including the one that was supposed to work really well for me according to the genetic testing they did. The only exceptions are kids. Kids are easy. Especially my own. When I play with my 1 yr old, my voice is animated again. And on the very rare occasion that he gets to be too much for me, I have a huge village that helps me tremendously. My newborn is the easiest little newborn ever, I'm so lucky to have had the babies I had. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to be myself again. I made my Nana cry because of this. Because I don't know how to fix it. Because she is scared for me. My nana doesn't cry. Ever. My mother constantly calls me hateful for things I say and I'm not even remotely upset when I say them. I want to stop being mean. I'm not a mean person. I'm not even a sarcastic person. ",
"Hello, I’m 28F with 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 yr old girls with my boyfriend 30m. I’ve struggled with PPD since my first pregnancy and was able to mange it quite well. During my second pregnancy 3 weeks before my due date, my best friend of 13 yrs passed away from natural causes. The next 2 weeks were extremely emotional for me. Even with my boyfriends support and patience, I was constantly crying. I ended up delivering my baby a week early. Luckily, my baby was perfectly healthy and we were able to go home 2 days later. But I feel like because I had a newborn and toddler to take care of, I didn’t get to grief properly when it happened. Now it’s almost two yrs and I still cry every night while listening to our old jams. If anyone has been through something close to this, how do you move forward? How you stop yourself from thinking about what could have been? I need advice please. ",
"Feeling absolutely defeated. Had another therapy session today after what I would call a full mental breakdown (dissociated, SI, crying hysterics) it’s never been that bad and I had to leave my house for the night and my husband took care of all 3 kids (9m, 5m, and 3 month old M). I’ve never been so scared I would actually end my life and I truly believe it is because I do need help and support but.. from who/where? My therapist again today was like ask for help-reach out for help/support- pay for a nanny/cleaner. I’ve told her before-financially it’s not an option and my parents won’t help I don’t have those kind of parents unfortunately and my husbands mom is old and just had hip surgery and can’t walk. In addition my amazing friends have kids themselves and are honestly just as burnt out? I just am so tired of hearing “ ask for help whenever you can” like ok therapist lady I’m asking YOU. In a non-ideal right financial decision with no family support: who am I asking??? My partner who is just as overwhelmed from carrying the weight I can’t right now?

"I had my first baby September 29th 2024. The delivery was an induction and everything went well with the labor. At my 6 week appointment in November I broke down to my OB that I was feeling disconnected from the baby, crying at everything, not looking forward to anything, would find myself anxious and not laughing at anything my husband said or just jokes in general. Once I was in a weird mood it was so hard to get out of. She had recommended I try counseling, go on an SSRI like Lexapro, or try Zurzuvae. She explained to me that it is a fairly new drug. You only take it for 2 weeks ,and that it does make you drowsy. I opted to try the Zurzuvae. You have to take the medication with fat so I would take it at night with ice cream. My husband did those night shifts with the baby. The first few nights I felt really drowsy and dizzy. By the time I woke up I felt okay to care for the baby but definitely still tired. Eventually it wore off towards the end of taking the meds. I do feel like around the 3rd day of taking it I felt in a much better mood and then from there I have felt better mentally. I started to laugh again. I felt so much more connected to the baby. I would honestly recommend taking this medication to any woman who is struggling with postpartum depression. It really helped me and I liked the fact that you only had to take it for 2 weeks instead of being on it more long term. 

I am off the medication for 2 months now and I still feel pretty good mentally. I guess the only thing I noticed was that I have a lot of rage and anger that I didn’t have before pre pregnancy. It’s more near my period so I’m sure it’s just my hormones still being all over the place or just life circumstances right now. This doesn’t change my opinion on taking the medication because I would totally still recommend it. However, it makes me wonder if my anger is due to the medication being worn off or my hormones not being back to normal yet. I have started therapy and I also think that is helping as well with me learning how to cope with my anger. 

I am posting this to share my experience with this medication. If anyone has any questions about it feel free to ask! ",
"My son is one and he has never slept through the night he sometimes wakes over 20 times a night and he has to sleep right next to me or on me or he will literally scream the whole street down and it’s taken its toll of my physical and mental health. I have a chronic illness too which causes me a lot of pain so it’s an extra struggle. I stay at home with him and spend most days living the same life it feels.. I get up on very little sleep and he wants to cling to me all day I can’t leave his sight or he screams. I love him so much but I feel so smothered by motherhood. My partner doesn’t do much for our son he maybe sits with him for half an hour in the evenings so I can have a bath but I do bed and bath for him every night and care for him all day. He also never wants to go to his dad probably because he doesn’t spend enough time with him and he’s also quite a moany/moody person will tell my son to shut up when he’s crying etc. I’ve told him how I feel smothered and like I have no life outside of being a mum that’s all I am now like I’ve lost myself and he said we’re in the same boat he has no life too as he works then doesn’t get to go out at the weekend now, he’s had plenty nights out since our son was born and he drinks every weekend at home anyways on his own but we clearly have very different priorities and I feel so isolated and lonely I just don’t want to be here anymore if I’m totally honest as much as I love my son I just am so drained emotionally, physically and mentally ",
I am currently 3 months pp. I feel like I’m going insane. I think that it might not only be my crazy hormones. It’s all my environment and my partner. I am scared to get medicated. I am not sure why everyone around me says like “oh you’ll get addicted” or “your baby deserves a drug free mom”. Did anyone try something before deciding to get medicated? Like ashwagandha or something like that? ,
"FTM and I am almost 5 weeks pp. I’ve always had anxiety but now it’s even worse. I’m struggling so bad with anxiety and ppd that I can’t even function on a daily basis anymore. I was so excited and happy for my baby to be here and now that she’s here I’m feeling the complete opposite. I love her so much but I also miss my old life and the way everything was before. I have so much anxiety and depression right now that it’s not allowing me to live in the moment and enjoy my baby as a newborn. The anxiety is so bad that I have no motivation to do anything when I used to love cleaning and doing things around the house. We have a two story house where the master is the only room downstairs and the rest are upstairs, so I never really went upstairs. Since my baby is still very little she’s gonna be downstairs with us until she’s big enough to go in her own room up there which won’t be for a while, but I feel like now I have a whole nother house to clean since l never had to worry about the upstairs. I know this sounds so stupid but I can’t help feeling the way that I am, my brain won’t let me think differently… My dogs hair is even giving me so much anxiety when it never did before. I just feel like it’s everywhere no matter what and I think it’s because lm now a SAHM so I’m always at home now. I’ve always wanted to be a SAHM but now idk. I wasn’t planning on going back to work but at the same time l want to. I only have a couple more weeks left of maternity leave and then I was going to tell them I’m not coming back but I just don’t know. I know I can’t work feeling this way especially with feeling so overwhelmed with everything. My dr just prescribed me more Prozac since the dose I was just on was lowered from being pregnant. I feel like it’s not helping whatsoever, not even a little bit. I’ve never felt so low or sad in my life. I should be happy right now, but I’m not. I have everything that I ever wanted yet I’m not happy. I feel terrible for feeling this way especially for my baby and my fiance. It’s not fair to them. I just want to feel Normal again and have the motivation that I had before. I’m also really struggling with the way I look right now. Im also in the process of removing a big tattoo on my arm so that’s making me hate the way I look even more. I’m also getting married in June so I really hope a miracle happens before then. I have so much to look forward to and yet I’m just sitting here sad and worried about every single thing in my life. Even the simplest tasks seem so hard to do… Thanks to anybody who took the time to read this.",

"4m post partum. I was diagnosed with PPD two weeks ago. Throughout the newborn phase, I have been extremely possessive of LO, and I keep feeling like family members who are holding / feeding him are “stealing” moments from me. I should feel happy that LO is getting so much love from others but instead I just feel resentful. My parents just arrived a few days ago and will be with us for the next two months and I already feel like my time with LO is impacted. 

Same thing with my husband. He has been on paternity leave along with my maternity leave and has been a tremendous father. LO is always smiling and laughing with him, more with him than me. I’m growing increasingly resentful and jealous of their bond because I feel like I’m hooked up to the pump all the time, so my husband is primarily the one feeding him and with time to play with him.

Have any of you felt this way? I return to work in a week and I’m feeling increasing grief that my limited remaining time with LO is taken up by others. How can I reframe this? ",
"Background: I’m 8 months postpartum and still breastfeeding. I’ve slowly dropped all night feedings and just dropped down to 4 feedings during the day time. I got my period back around 4.5 months postpartum and my last period sort of never stopped. I’ve been spotting on and off for 3 weeks now. It’s not heavy but it’s touch and go and pretty much every other day light bleeding. My mental health has slowly gotten worse. 

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and I am diagnosed ADHD with OCD tendencies and behaviors like skin picking. The past month I’ve been experiencing mood swings that change within a 10-20 minute span of time or even shorter. It’s like one minute I’m so excited and happy about life and can’t wait to do the next thing on my list of to dos, and within ten minutes I’m enraged by the smallest little thing and feel so angry and hopeless. It’s like im sitting outside of my body watching myself behave like a child because of the most ridiculous little things and I can’t stop myself? I’m not sleeping well at all either. My LO sleeps through the night so i have no reason not to be getting good sleep but it’s like I wake up exhausted as if I’ve been working out all night. I’m a little bit paranoid and really anxious and I feel myself getting angry all the time and then it switches to joy and happiness so fast. It’s pretty scary. 

I have a psych appointment scheduled in a couple of weeks to discuss medication and I’m getting a Pap smear Tuesday to make sure everything’s okay there. I’ve been in therapy for years but had to stop in November to afford childcare. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I’m wondering if anyone can relate. I don’t know if it sounds like PPD or what but it’s pretty exhausting and concerning",
"I currently have 2 babies under the age of 2. I returned to work back in December, and at first, I was elated. I had postpartum depression last year with my daughter, but with my son, I was much better. I was excited going back to work and getting back into my normal routine of things.

Immediately, I returned to a complete shit show. Nobody’s fault, but I came back to 3 of my coworkers out on FMLA themselves. Wishing them all the best, as none of this is any of their faults or their problem. 

The problem is, one of the girls that are out works a shift that starts at 5 in the morning. I work in a healthcare setting. My normal job is back end work. So, I work on accounts and I have my desk job upstairs, but I am expected to cover the admitting department areas when needed. When I first took the job, I knew that it was in my job description to cover occasional vacation times and requested days off. 

Well, now it has turned into coming in at 5 in the morning every single day, which has put an enormous amount of stress on my babies, my partner, and my whole family. My husband does not have a set schedule at his job. Some nights, he’s not getting home until 10pm and other days he’s going in as early as 7am. Neither of us are getting any sleep.

When I expressed the emotional and physical toll this is taking on my family, I was told that this is my position and that this is what is expected of me. I have been refusing to come in at 5 some days and told them that I will be there at my normal 9am scheduled time because I do not have anybody to watch my babies that early some days. My sister and my mother help out as much as they can, but they have full time jobs themselves and can’t always help.

My hair is falling out, I’m dealing with overly tired infants, because no matter what I do, the second i wake up, they wake up. They are both still breastfed. 

I didn’t realize how much it was affecting me until I found myself crying on my way to work some days because of how stressed out I am over this. I have lost 40 pounds since returning to work. It’s to the point where I just don’t think this is worth it anymore. I’ve put my application out to 15 different places. I’m hoping someone will call me back soon. I can’t take it anymore. I wish I could be a stay at home mom.",
"I am 5 weeks pp with my second beautiful baby boy. I definitely had PPA with my first. It manifested in extreme worry for his wellbeing. This time I am more confident in my parenting, but I am consumed with crippling feelings of name regret. These thoughts haunt me all day long. I find myself referring to him as “baby” or “little guy” and cringe every time I use his name. My husband has been supportive of my feelings and says we can change his name if I have an alternative that I like more. The issue is that I don’t have another name that I like more or that feels like it suits him. I am wondering if this is a symptom of PPD/PPA that I should be addressing? Has anyone else had these feelings? How did you cope? ",
Why is getting Zurzuvae so damn hard? I’m already struggling and I literally have to battle with this stupid specialty pharmacy. First of all they didn’t submit the prior authorization paperwork to my doctor for over a week. Doctor submitted prior auth to insurance. I called them and due to it being for postpartum depression they approved it that day rather than their typical 48 hour turn around time. The person I talked to at the insurance company was literally the most helpful person and she even called and talked to the pharmacy because they just kept saying it wasn’t approved even though it was. Insurance said they hadn’t even submitted claims. Now I’m battling the stupid pharmacy to get them to submit the stupid claim and send me the meds. It’s ridiculous. I need help. Why do they make getting help so difficult? ,
"I have bipolar 2, CPTSD, and have felt depression before, but fuck is this another beast. I've had suicidal ideations before, and have tried before, but I've been thinking of anyway to end it when I'm in a depressive episode. Thankfully my husband is very understanding and supportive, so everything I could use has been locked up or is under close supervision. 

I feel like my son would be better off without me, and my husband should go find someone that would be an actual loving mother. Don't get me wrong, I love my son, but I have no motivation or energy to do anything with him besides lay on the floor while he crawls around and watches his shows. I've even tried multiple times to make my husband so mad that he would say he wants a divorce so I can go end it, and they can live happily ever after. 

We moved out of a metroplex with 120k people living in our city 3 years ago to the country where the whole county only has 80k people living here. I'm used to being able to go ten minutes down the road to a friend or family's house, or even walk 500 feet to a neighbor's for support. We didn't plan on having kids when we moved out here, but of course life said ""nope, it's time"", and here we are. I guess I'm looking for support and for people to tell me I'm not alone on an island in a hurricane that is postpartum. ",
"I have a toddler and a 2 month newborn (2 under 2). My sister in law has been living with us for one year and it is just having a negative impact on my marriage and now mental health. My husband is overly obsessed with his extended family in my opinion. My SIL comes from a mother country, despite having two kids and working my husband takes her to  school  every night at 7 and picks her up at 9 every night despite the fact that we live in a city where trains and buses are everywhere. 

She’s home all day during my maternity leave but cooks in the kitchen all day. I don’t know what for. Maybe boredom!  I do not eat those foods but my kitchen is ALWAYS occupied. Sometimes my baby only sleeps 30 minutes, with eduaobkwt pumping I need ro wash the bottles or pump and get things in the kitchen but she is always there!!!!! Crowding my space

Me and my husband barely have any time together due to him working and the kids. When we do have a few minutes together she never excuses herself to give us one time to eat in the kitchen or just to chat. In fact on a daily basis she tells my husbands stories of what happened with my toddler before I her a chance and then overallks and interiors our conversations regularly where I can’t get a word in. 
She stays in the kitchen with my husband while he cooks and I’m there too pumping and doesn’t remove herself, just talks to him in their language I can’t understand because she doesn’t speak English. 

She’s not hygienic, doesn’t take
Regular showers. Have to remind her to wash her hands so I don’t feel
Comfortable with her helping with the newborn in anyway, she helps with the toddler from Time to time 

My husband is so sensitive over his family when we talk about in the past,
it ends up explosive  and I have to walk on egg shell with feedback on his  family. We have been to therapy many times about other family members in the past that he had livinf with us:
He wants her to come to church with us and be 100% integrated  in our lives:  there is no plan for her to move out because he is  trying to find her a job but she has no skills and  can’t speak English. sometimes I feel like a third wheel I hate it here. He’s been trying to get her an apartment but no progress for 8 months ",
"I am a FTM 3wks pp and suffering from depression, anxiety, and so much rage that I can barely function on the daily since my husband went back to work. I think I have lingering trauma from my birth experience as well - I truly thought I was going to die while I was having my baby.

I try to meet my baby’s needs immediately, but she will scream bloody murder if I’m not fast enough and I get overwhelmed/overstimulated almost instantly. My husband says that babies cry for no reason and I can’t deal with the crying that just won’t stop. I’ve never done well with noises, I am sensitive to sound and have never coped well with it. I handle this by screaming back at my baby and then crying with guilt because she doesn’t deserve it. It’s a vicious cycle and I just don’t know how to stop it. Even putting her down in her crib in her room doesn’t help because our walls are so thin I can hear her shrieking. Then the anxiety of being away from her kicks in and I’m scared something will happen. I fear putting in headphones or ear plugs because how will I hear her if she starts to choke or something?

My pride won’t let me reach out for help either, and I know how stupid that is. My mentality is that I wanted to be a mother for so long, why am I so desperate to escape it? I feel like a failure if I need to ask for help. Which is also ridiculous because I feel like I’ve failed my daughter already. I gave up breastfeeding because it was too much and I am constantly on edge/stressed out. Pumping has become an absolute waste of time because my production (which was already low after a complicated birth) is now abysmal and it just makes me feel worse. I struggled to give myself any credit, any grace, any kindness before I got pregnant and it’s worsened tenfold since my daughter was born. I am so awful to myself.

I am overcome with emotions that are drowning me every day to the point that I want to end it all. I have an initial consult with a therapist in 6 days, but that feels like an eternity away. I have never been so mentally unwell in my entire life and I’m so scared that therapy won’t help me or that I’ll ruin my child. I don’t have fears of hurting her ever, but I do have a fear that my mental health will continue to plummet and I’ll hurt myself terribly. And no child needs a mom that is so at risk or that can’t find any joy in life. To make matters worse, my own mom died almost 8 months ago and I haven’t been able to heal from that. I miss her so much and I hate that I’ve had to go through this without her. 

Her dad is a godsend because he immediately takes over when he gets home and on the weekends, he does his best to listen and validate my feelings as I break down into a crying mess every night, he wishes so much that he didn’t have to go back to work so soon after our daughter came. He has encouraged me to go to therapy because we both know he isn’t a professional and not equipped to wrangle what I assume is PPD/PPA/PPR. I love my husband so much and I feel so lucky to have had a child with him, but I feel like my child deserves someone better to be her mom.

I just don’t know how to manage - how do you do it? How do you cope with these out of control feelings? How do you better acclimate to motherhood? Were there any resources or support groups that helped you get through? Was therapy enough? Did you need medication too? Looking for guidance, sympathy, or anything really.

Signed, a mom who is ready to give up",
"Im 4 months pp and am starting to feel a little more myself again or so I thought. My husband and I had a conversation about how our love life is non existent. I will admit I have not given it my all when comes to our relationship but half of the time I'm either exhausted from staying up with the baby or have to catch up on chores around the house. He made it clear that he does not want another kid after this one( only our first) because it has not been fun the last 4 months and has been feeling unloved like i put him second to our baby. I always to try to listen to him and adjust myself when he feels like this but this time I wanted to go off on him and tell him that all he lost was probably sleep but I lost myself, my body, my independence and I'm not complaining. I need some tips and suggestions on how to handle this situation. Our baby is still small and needs care and if I dont who will? It seems like he wants me to ignore our baby and give him my undivided attention. That just not an easy thing to do. Am I in the wrong? Is he? What can I say to him to help him understand me a little more without hurting his feelings?",
"Just did typed this, and it hit me in the face like a ton of bricks. Please, if you have any advice for me, I need it. Posting to two subs only. I need help. ",
"I had my second baby 7 weeks ago and I've been struggling since. My dad had major heart surgery days after giving birth, so all attention was on my dad and with that nobody asked how I was and nobody came to visit in the first month. Being alone during this time was hard, and then there's my toddler who struggled with sharing mummy and a new baby. 
Last week I officially snapped and needed a whole day off as there is a little voice in my head saying 'noonr cares'. 
I told my health visitor all of this and she is referring to a perinatal team to help me through all my struggles. 

It's been hard talking to anyone about this as everyone has assumed I'm struggling because I'm worried about my dad. Of course I'm worried, but that's not why I'm struggling and need help. ",
"second time mom with a 23 month old and a 5 week old. lately I’ve been struggling at night time. especially given our sleep schedule. my toddler decided one day while i was pregnant that he wanted to stay up all night and it’s been like that ever since. i stay up with the kids so my husband can sleep for work at 7am. i slee when he gets home and throughout the day with the kids when my toddler finally sleeps but it’s just so hard at night. it feels so unreal. i feel like the only person on the entire planet because i am quite literally the only person that i know that is awake right now. i have no clue how else to explain the endless loneliness im feeling right now. it’s different than the normal feeling lonely. 

diagnosed w/ ppd & ppa for both postpartum periods and im currently medicated as well. ",
"Today is a bad day so I might be dramatic. It’s probably because it’s winter as well. Recently i’ve been really moody and i’m just reflecting and realize i’m never really happy anymore. I love my son, I do everything for him. People always acknowledge that and I appreciate it but I always feel like i’m a sh***y mom. I have no time for my child. I don’t ever play with him. I don’t even read anymore. I’m just annoyed with him 24/7. He deserves better. I hate this. I’m a single mom, it’s been this way for almost 2 years and I still suck at juggling everything. I’m working 40hrs a week, I’m in school half time online, I workout everyday (trying to) I take care of the house and cook, idk, you know how it is. I find myself feeling guilty I don’t know how to connect with him to play. I try, but it’s very short lived. Hence why i’m annoyed with him. I know he’s a child but the no independence is just hard when i’m trying to do everything myself all the time. I wish I had a roomate because he’s so great when other people are around but when it’s just me and him man..i hate it. I think this will be better when he’s a little older but i’m struggling right now. I’ve been fine but I think i’m hitting another breaking point. thanks for reading these are my thoughts right now as i rocked my almost 2 year old to sleep. now off to clean and eat lunch at 230 pm. ",
"I just needed somewhere to say this. 

I don’t regret my child. I really wanted her but I’m clearly not built for this. I’m failing miserably.",
"Is there anything anyone did to prevent PPD the second time knowing you were likely to have PPD? For example, did you get right back on SSRIs? Never stop? Breast feed? What helped? My body is REALLY sensitive to the hormonal drop—less about the life changes.  Thank you! ",
"I don’t regret being a mom, but I don’t think I was meant to be a mom. Life is so hard right now and I don’t have energy to do it anymore. I’m not mentally strong enough to handle this life style…the stay at home mom lifestyle. I know what I need to do to get help, but I don’t have the resources to help me. Childcare + money. I never thought I would be having these horrible thoughts. Somehow my children have brought out the best in me yet they also bring out the worst in me. I absolutely hate the fact they have been getting the “over stimulated” “over whelmed” “over touched” “negative” “unhappy” version of me. I truly pray life gets better because it’s going on 2 years of being in the trenches of motherhood.",
"I was SO excited to enjoy the newborn phase with my daughter, especially knowing she’d be my last baby. My son’s newborn phase two years ago was tough but I had so much overwhelming love and happy moments, and I LOVED everything about it, even the hard parts. 

I expected the babies to be different but never thought I’d resent this girl so much for not letting me enjoy the newborn phase. I wanted to breastfeed longer but all of a sudden she just started refusing, screaming herself red in the face no matter what I try. I thought my son was hard to feed but this girl is an absolute nightmare unless it’s a bottle, and every time it doesn’t work I get so overwhelmed and angry that I’m not getting to bond or she doesn’t need me or I don’t even know what. It’s to the point that I don’t even want to hold her anymore. And every time it doesn’t work I can only think about how more time keeps passing that I’m not getting to enjoy and I’m missing the phase I generally love, and I can’t get that time back. 

But then I get upset when she smiles at me too! Like “oh now you like me? Yeah right.” I know it’s not her fault. I know it’s not fair. 

I can’t believe how awful I must be to be angry AT her. I wish I liked her. I want to be obsessed with her no matter what she does to me. I don’t wish I had a different baby but I wish she was different. And that’s so messed up.",
"I'm a first time mom. My son was born 2 months ago. I had trouble conceiving and did fertility treatments. After a 2nd round of IVF I was pregnant. My pregnancy was uneventful and I felt good throughout. My water broke spontaneously at 38 weeks. I pushed for several hours, but baby would not move, so I had a C-section. The next morning 3 doctors entered the hospital room to tell me my son has down syndrome. I felt completely gutted and shocked. Fast forward two months, I am barely surviving. I have SI. I talk to my therapist about it. I've joined and talked to several community groups, one for postpartum individuals and another for DS families. Every minute of every day I'm thinking why did this happen to me. I don't want to be here. I don't want a son with down syndrome. ",
"My child is 2, and I still struggle with PPD. There's a lot of backstory to this, but basically he (my partner) wanted to keep the baby but I wanted to give her up for adoption. In my state, both parents have to give consent for adoption, because he did not want to do it, we ended up keeping her. Recently he and I are no longer together as I feel like I was forced into being a mother because I'm against abortion and it has destroyed the relationship for me. I'm over it, I'm over everything and would like to give him full custody of our child and move on with my life. I know this is not as common for women, but do any of you have experience with signing over your parental rights or know a woman that has done it? ",
"I feel bad even writing this out into the void. 

I feel like I do have postpartum depression. I really really thought I wasn't. I was excited to be on leave with the LO and bond all throughout pregnancy. 

Now that I am about 6 weeks in I feel as if I destroyed my life and my partners. I miss the life before with my man and my cats. It was quiet and peaceful. 

Now my days are spent dealing with my baby who just screams and cries and refuses to settle. (Just got over a 3 hour session. We both cried and I excused myself to scream into a pillow). I've tried swings, bouncers, baby wearing, headphones, I went through the check list on a loop hungry, diaper, burp, check clothes, check temp. It all just eventually ends in him falling asleep from crying or screaming so much I guess

Doctors assume he's colic and will grow out of it. I am pumping since he couldn't latch due to my nipples being a little bumpy due to having neurofibromatosis. I feel sometimes it's my fault he's colicky because of my milk, but doctors say he doesn't have CMPA and don't recommend me changing my diet since he's gaining weight and is over all healthy. 

I want to run away. I don't want this right now. I'm so tired and touched out. I hate being alone with the baby for 10 hours a day while my partner works. 
He does everything in his power when home to help, but at that time I'm at the breaking point and I feel so bad for being short with him. 

I just don't know what to do. I have my 6 week postpartum check up tomorrow and I'm scared if I'm honest on how I feel they will take my baby away, or commit me, or judge me. I just feel bad for being depressed because I allowed this pregnancy so essentially this depression and anger is my fault in my head. 

Please tell me if I am honest what will happen during my check up? ",
"I just turned 27 and had a baby 9 months ago. I am also married and my marriage is a literal dumpster fire at the moment (that’s a whole other story I won’t get in to) but I think I am having an identity crisis? 
Before my baby I was a bartender for 7 years and was making 6 figures, I was doing okay for myself but HATED my job. It made me so so miserable. I was so happy to quit and be a stay at home mom, but now that I am, it isn’t what I thought it would be (shocker) 
I would love to find my passion but nothing sounds enjoyable to me. I don’t have patience for anything. No job or hobbies intrigue me, I am not a creative person. Not to mention I have terrible self esteem and always have, with a baby it’s just so intensified. I hate the way I look, I absolutely pick myself apart everytime I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror or even a photo of myself. I care so much about how others perceive me. I am not confident in myself and I truly don’t think I am capable of doing hard things like getting a degree, starting a new job, starting a hobby, even leaving the house sounds like a huge mountain that I cannot climb. I am so unhappy with myself and with my life and I know it’s all because of me, I have never truly put in the work to find myself. I thought I knew who I was but do I really? Am I depressed? Have I always been depressed? I have so much going on in my head all the time, I feel like the thought of even doing something new or out of my comfort zone sounds impossible for me. I’m so jealous and people who know who they are and are confident and happy, I want that so badly. How do I even get there?

I gave birth in May to a beautiful baby boy. The pregnancy was relatively easy and something my husband and I both wanted and had been looking forward to for years. Fast forward to the birth. Everything went pretty well until I got to 9 cm at which point his heart started to drop. I was rushed into the OR for an emergency C section but ended up vaginally delivering instead after two hours of pushing. The recovery was slow but okay. I was proud of how I could handle the sleepless nights and other challenges. Then came going back to work. I don’t know if it was the stress of going back to work or working out but all of a sudden my pelvic floor went haywire. I could no longer properly use the bathroom and no one could diagnose me. This swung me into a deep depression and anxiety and I went from loving being a mom to wanting nothing to do with my baby. I have since started therapy and medication and seem to slowly be improving on the mental end. I am still no where near where I wanted to be as a mom and I’m scared I’ll never come back. My medical issues are still up in the air and I don’t know if they are permanent or if I can have more children. I feel so helpless and alone. I’m grieving the loss of no more kids while somehow not being able to mother the son I currently have. ,
"Had my second baby 2 months ago with our 2.5yo, some days I’m doing so good doing it all and others I’m just crumbling and useless. How do I in one day take care of both my babies, keep the house at least some what clean, feed myself well, drink enough water and get in a workout all off no sleep. My baby had been waking every single hour after around 2-5am until we get up for the day at 10. Im so tired of this, I keep going back and forth if I have ppd or not, I got a phych appt scheduled at my 6week appt, wasn’t for until 2 months out! So I still have a few weeks and Some days I feel like I can’t make it to then. I keep going over and over it in my head of how the appointment is going to go and what do I even say in a 30min appointment,and if I’ll be prescribed anything, is this really as bad as it feels, am I over reacting, is it even worth it. I’m in the military at the moment and I’m getting out in like 2 months so my insurance will be gone. What if the pills work and then I can’t have them anymore and it hurts that much more going back to feeling like this. Is it even worth it to feel happy for a litttle bit if I’m just going to go back? I can’t even cry about anything anymore I just sit with a glazed over stare feeling sorry for myself and feel in capable of doing anything. My husband is so very supportive but I feel like a nuisance! He told me he feels like he’s taking care of 3 people and I haven’t help cook meals in so long and he’s right, he didn’t feel like he could talk to me about it cause he thought id just snap back at him, and he was right. All I wanted to do was get upset at him, but I kept my cool and tried to understand him, I do understand him. He’s right. So I tried and am trying to do better around the house. But I just don’t know who or what to prioritize right now. Who’s more important right now me or my family, it hurts to much to thing about my life like this. It should always be me AND my family, not one or the other. I love my husband and my kids to the ends of the earth, my family and my home is quite literally the only things I give a fuck about. I don’t have any friends and struggle to make any from my own insecurities and I’m sure that doesn’t make things better at all. I have no one else to check up on me or that I can keep up with or relate to.
this hurts so bad.",
"So I'm 9 months postpartum. I was not prepared for the insane amounts of rage and I have never cried or screamed so much in my life. But I'm doing my best and trying to be a better version of me everyday. Now that I feel my partner and I are somewhat out of the metaphorical trenches and have a routine flowing now, things are much better. But neither of us realised that by becoming parents ourselves, it literally cracks your psyche right open and all of your wonderful repressed childhood trauma spills right out. We have both been working on things and how we respond to situations and people and frustrations. He has realised his own parents were never there for him emotionally, never let him express emotion at all, lied to him, only made him feel worthy if he could do things for them and got treated like an absolute inconvenience. This has turned him into a people pleaser and he struggles to put himself first. His parents have the most dysfunctional relationship and his mother clearly doesn't get what she needs emotionally from his dad/ her husband and tries to fulfill that with her son (my partner). I never realised how controlling and self absorbed she was until I got pregnant and had my baby. She didn't ask how I was going basicly the entire pregnancy, when I laid out some fair and clear boundaries in the family group chat, she just laugh reacted it. My partner reluctantly invited her to the hospital a day after I gave birth just so she didn't get upset as my mum had been in quickly that same morning (my mum had helped me wash all the baby clothes, set up the nursery and baby sat my dog while in hospital in labour) and when visiting my MIL kissed my daughter on her head. I grabbed my baby back and was devastated. I spent that night in hospital holding my baby alone just sobbing all night long. After this when we got home she posted a photo on Facebook of my daughter after being asked not to (before I had posted) and when I asked her to remove it she said "" I guess I've just fucked up again"". Because of hormones and PPD and existing anxiety made worse by the hormones etc, I spent the first few weeks just sobbing and feeling so furious and betrayed. His dad is now so cold to me because his son (my partner) actually puts his own new family first and doesn't go building houses and doing jobs for his dad for free in his spare time. My partner runs his own business and not once has his family asked how it's all going. He started it in January last year and our daughter was born in April. He did it so I can be a stay at home mum. I had a good relationship with them prior to getting pregnant. - for context I've known mu partner 20 years and we have been together for 10 years. But yeah since I don't just go along with everything they say and my partner holds boundaries now they are cold and rude. My partner has told me horrible things his dad said to him growing up and now it all makes sense some of the mental impact it has had. I resent them both. Can anyone relate or have advice. ",
"I’ve been struggling with OCD, PPD, and PPA and I feel like it’s killing me. My main issue is that I want to have that bond with my baby everyone talks about. Like the overwhelming love and connection I hear so much about.  I’m going on 11 months now with my little guy and I just don’t feel much towards him and it’s driving me crazy. Like I’m afraid to have another kid if I’m gonna feel like this forever, in the beginning I had hope but now that it’s almost a year I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in therapy and take medication, I have a psychiatrist but nothing is working!!",

My psychiatrist is insisting the next time I have thoughts like that I go to a hospital to keep myself and my baby safe. But they admit that it isn't really therapeutic, just a safety measure. I have safeties at home, and don't really feel excited about a hospital bill.
Does anyone have experiences? How was it? Did it seem helpful? 
If not, but if you are struggling in a similar way, how are you handling it?",
"So I found out I was pregnant and I have a 9 month baby. I had an easy pregnancy with my daughter but a terrible postpartum sadly. I still have ppd and ocd but ocd comes and goes now. It was the worst time of my life. I lost 50 pounds from stress and not eating. Sadly I decided to abort the recent pregnancy which hurt so bad and if I wasn’t going through it mentally I’d love to have another child. I got pregnant while on nexplanon. Basically what I’m getting at is my OCD is starting to flare up so bad and intrusive thoughts towards my daughter are getting worse. I had a medication induced abortion today. Is something like this normal? I was on prozac, it worked for intrusive thoughts but it made me very sleepy so I stopped. Is there anything else that could help with PP OCD this will be my 5th month dealing with it � ",
"I think I’ve had PPD for ages now. I have twins, they’re now 3. Also have a 8 month old. Suspected I had PPD early on with the twins. I was too ashamed and in disbelief about it. Kept excusing my emotions and hoped it would get better (it hasn’t, obviously). I think I probably have post partum rage. I can’t stop being so angry. I lost my temper so many times over and over. I’m just not the person I used to be. Almost everything my twins do upset or anger me and it’s breaking up our family now that my partner and I are splitting up. I won’t go into all the other emotions I’ve felt, but I’ve not been in a good place for quite a while now. 

But, I did it - I finally phoned the GP and asked for an appt. They’re seeing me next week. The receptionist asked me the nature of my problem so they could make sure I’m seeing the right practitioner (I’m in England btw). When I told her I think I have ppd, I just cried while saying it. I knew I couldn’t hold it back. She’s the first person I’ve said it to. This Reddit post is now the second. It feels weird to be finally accepting it and that I need help. 

I’m scared now though. Can anyone share their experiences of what it’s like to take anti-depressants? I’m scared it won’t work, that I’ll feel nothing. 

I hope it gets better. I do feel good about making this first step. ",
"It’s 2am in Australia and I’m just calming down from it now. 

I tell you what, struggling with post partum depression and anxiety has been shit but it’s really showed me that I married the right person. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety and OCD since I was a child, and then started experiencing depression a bit later on. 

But ive never had a panic attack like this before. My hands and face were tingling, my chest felt like it was caving in, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

My husband is incredible and immediately jumped into action and tried a million different things but not much helped. I went and stood outside, took a shower, tried deep breathing with my husband guiding me, but nothing tackled it. 

So he went and found our cat who was sleeping in the window and that immediately calmed me down. Google also said if you’re struggling with breathing to cover your hand with your mouth and to breathe through your nose and that also helped. 

So I sat in the rocking chair in the nursery clutching our cat and covering my mouth and it immediately started winding down. 

I’d love to hear any other tips if anyone has them. ",
"Someone please tell me this gets better. I genuinely don’t know how to keep pushing through. It’s nearly 2:30 in the morning and I am sat having yet another mental breakdown in the living room while my husband fails to soothe our forever sobbing month old baby. I honestly just want to run away, die, or just do something crazy to throw my life down the drain. I have support, but I can feel the disappointment of my spouse and family for failing so horribly at being a mother. Maybe I am just too young and selfish to give up my entire being to this tiny life 24/7. Maybe I just was never capable of being a mom in the first place and have made the biggest mistake of my life. I feel so horribly guilty for feeling this way..I love my daughter with my whole heart and soul, but right now love doesn’t feel like enough. I don’t feel capable of this and I’m so fucking scared. 

Today is my 23rd birthday. No one even remembered. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to die.",
"Long story short, I had a traumatic birth, things didn’t work out while they were putting me back together and now I can’t have more children. I am done. 
I am devastated. I have been mourning the children I won’t have while celebrating my newborn I do have, it’s been very confusing.

I started my period today, it’s really hard for me, I feel like this is the official end of my pregnancy experiences. Like a closed chapter. I am having trouble coping.",

"First time poster here. I struggle immensely after having my first child. To the point where I would look up “safe havens” to drop him off and questioned why I was here. I luckily had a supportive husband, family friends and doctor who got me back into a sound headspace after 6 months. Now I  feel guilty about not enjoying those months with my child because every single day I wake up I can’t imagine a life without him or being his mom. I love nothing more in this life than being a mom. It’s crazy to me how complex our brains can be. To go from one end of the spectrum to another.


Jumping ahead a bit. 

My LO is approaching 2 and my husband and I are talking about having another. If it was up to him I would have been pregnant months ago but he is understanding that I am nervous and need time. there’s no pressure from him at all. He just loved being a dad haha.

I feel like I’m in such a wonderful spot now so I’m looking for advice from other moms who have struggled with PPD and have another child. I want a second but I am truly terrified of struggling again and now while taking care of a toddler. I don’t want him to see me the way I was. It’s truly been such a mental block for me to consider a second but in my heart and soul I know I want this.

Looking for any words of wisdom or advice here for anyone who has gone through a similar thought process. Hoping this is a safe space for opening up about this. It’s been difficult for me to speak about it.

"My husband (28M) and I (27F) just had a baby 9 months ago. He took such good care of me postpartum, he has always taken such good care of me. Our relationship has been nothing short of legendary. I have never felt a love like I have with him. (We’ve been together for 7 years married for almost 2.) 
After having our baby and him going back to work things have changed drastically. He doesn’t even know if he wants to be in this marriage anymore. I asked him on a scale of 1-10 if he wanted to save this marriage he said 5. He is a completely different person, it is so hard to accept and to even see him that way. I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone. This has been going on for a couple months now, he just keeps saying he doesn’t know what he wants. It is torture living in this house with him because I love him SO much and he literally doesn’t want to touch me, kiss me, barley will even say “I love you” and treats me like a friend. It’s excruciatingly painful I don’t even know what to do with myself. I know people say things get really rough in the first year of parenthood but this seems like more than that.. I’ve looked through his phone (which I’ve never done before this) multiple times and have found absolutely nothing, not even him liking girls photos so I don’t think he is being disloyal. What am I supposed to do? Do I give him space and let him heal whatever he needs to heal? Am I being neglected? Do I keep fighting to save us? I am so lost. I can’t even imagine a world in which we are not together but he seems like the only thing holding him back from wanting a divorce is our son. 


For more context, he works a VERY demanding job and I stay home. Staying home has been a huge transition for me as I went from making 6 figures to being a stay at home mom and not making my own money. I understand his job is really demanding physically and mentally, I really feel for him in that aspect. I have also been struggling though and have let my postpartum rage get the best of me at times and this is where this all started. There is so much distance between us now because neither of our needs are getting met. He said “if I really wanted to save this marriage I don’t think it would be hard but I just don’t know if I want that yet.” So what am I supposed to do? Wait around for him? I mean after all this is a marriage and I feel like fighting for it and white knuckling through it is what you’re supposed to do right? He isn’t mean to me, he’s very respectful and is still there for me but.. am I being a fool? Should I just call the marriage? I am so lost on what I’m supposed to do. ",
I got the prescription in October but held off on taking it until now because I was doing better and afraid to take it while breastfeeding. I hope I don’t regret it but I’m continuing to breastfeed. I just can’t go on like this. The depression came back with a vengeance this holiday season. I will definitely post again with updates. Please send good vibes that it will work �,
"I gave birth to my son almost a month ago. I have felt so incredibly angry lately. Even with my two eldest children who are only (4) and (3) both who are on the spectrum my (4) has ADHD tendencies and my (3) is autistic. My partner is a first time dad and he has struggled with adjusting to being stepdad let alone father. He is working right now until I get the clearance from my OB that I can return to work. He complained to me tonight that he feels all he does is go to work and then come home to work. He works overnights so it is usually me by myself with my eldest two and my newborn. I am the one who cooks dinner almost eveey night and I also get the older two ready for bed and whatnot by myself with my newborn attached me. Our relationship has been rocky since I have been pregnant due to me being unable to take my medication while pregnant. It has affected my mental state beyond belief. He says he loves me but then tells me he doesn’t care about my feelings right now. I am at a list right now for everything. I just feel like he really doesn’t want to be in this relationship with me anymore. He just sits there in silence, everytime I ask him what’s wrong he says it’s nothing and just shuts me out. I am suffering even more mentally because of this. I am beginning to realize that we may not ever be a good fit… he only thinks of himself right now. I just feel that I am better off alone ",
I was a super wife before and during my pregnancy but now since I gave birth to my beautiful daughter I became such a couch potato. I have no motivation to get up. Ive been sleeping for long hours. I struggle to eat and even do my hygiene. I feel so tired all the time. What is wrong with me? It’s like Im a completely different person. It’s been 5 months now since I gave birth and it feels like nothing has changed and I fear I will get stuck like this. Idk what to do. Everyone keeps saying to get up and go for a walk or do things little by little but it’s such a struggle and everything feels forced. I feel terrible because my husband has to juggle a lot of responsibilities. He has been extremely patient with me but I don’t think I can stand this any longer. I have to be a better wife and especially a better mom for my daughter. Any advice to kick this ppd in the butt would be much appreciated. Thank you,
I feel like I’m trying so hard to ask for help and no one is hearing me. I’m so close to just giving up. I feel so unheard I really cannot take this anymore. Everyday is literally a struggle and the only reason I’m trying to hold on is my for my son I know he needs me. I just feel so broken.im so tired of crying. I just feel like I’m on autopilot and my baby deserves so much more�. Pray for me. Tips or advice on how to deal with ppd,
"I've just had my 3rd and final baby. Only 6 weeks postpartum. I've already started my first period even though I'm exclusively pumping breastmilk, my body looks horrible, I spilled my breastmilk  that I worked so hard to pump this morning, and I got into a huge fight with my friend about not being around enough....so I guess that means I push him away further?

It feels like with each child I had my ppd gets worse and worse.  I also think that the fact that I'm 38 has a lot to do with my hormones being out of wack. I just feel bad about everything literally all the time, but then I feel bad because I really have nothing to feel bad for except myself.  

I keep trying to tell myself to just suck it up, but it's really not an option. I've tried. I just want to feel ""normal"" again what ever that means.  ",
"This is my third baby and my third bout of PP mental health issues, and while my first go around I think was worse this time feels *harder* because of all the responsibilities I have. I have a 3 and 5 year old older siblings and an almost 3 month old baby. This baby sleeps well at night but I cannot put him down during the day. His siblings were able to sleep some on their own by now and this kid isn’t having it. I am exhausted and stressed and overwhelmed and I hate my day to day life. I know this isn’t my normal - I am a SAHM and I love it. But all I do is hold the baby. He hates the car and screams the entire drive every time, we barely leave the house. He has CMPI and I can’t eat dairy. I’m barely eating, losing weight, can’t do anything with or for my older kids. I keep trying to get this kid to sleep in his crib during the day and he just won’t. I have been through this enough to *know* I will get better but I don’t feel it. I just want to get back to normal and cook and clean and craft with my kids and leave my dang house. I want to be able to spend time with all of my family instead of my husband and I splitting into “big kid” vs “baby” duty. With my second I was coming out of the fog around now and it’s just not happening yet. ",
"I’m currently 2 weeks postpartum and at first I didn’t think I was gonna have postpartum depression I just mainly had anxiety but as the days go by, being up all night with my babygirl. And just lacking on self care, being home from work for 6 weeks, not making money, I’ve been kinda going down the slope and feeling empty. No one has wanted to come see me and babygirl since being out of the hospital, no one really reaches out, I have the best support from my boyfriend/baby’s father but I’m still struggling to feel whole, he makes sure I’m always good but I can’t help but cry because I’m just so all over the place. Then I start to think that I’m failing as a mom, but I’m doing everything I can for my child, I’m also a First time mom and I know there’s no handbook to parenting. Anyone else feel like this? � ",
"I am a single mom, My baby is about to be 5 months and I feel like postpartum depression/rage is hitting me now as in the beginning I was perfectly fine. I find myself getting frustrated at my daughter (actually everyone) over the smallest things and things I know she can’t control! I feel like a bad mom at times. She is my everything but omg. She just got her 4 month vaccines and has NOT slept! I’m exhausted and frustrated I have tried EVERYTHING. I have cried for the past 3 hours telling her to please go to bed!! I feel terrible she’s just a baby & I know it’s from her shots but I’m sooo frustrated. Been thinking about reaching out to my doctor & getting on medication. If anyone has, which medication did you try and did it help you? Please help lol ",
"I’m 9 months postpartum and am looking to start something to help with my anxiety and depression. I was on Zoloft postpartum with my 1st who is now 3 and it made me rage, gain 50 lbs and didn’t keep the awful thoughts at bay. It was such an awful experience I swore off any medication for my mental health but I’m coming to terms with the fact therapy just might not cut it for me! I am still breastfeeding but will likely stop around the year mark. I am open to dang near anything that will help me feel okay again. Please tell me your experiences, good or bad! ",
"My wife and I have been together for nearly 15 years and married for 5. Our youngest child is 2. With our first child everything was good and we didn’t deal with any of this. When our second child was born, due to some circumstances, I was very limited in my ability to help for most of the first year of his life. This child was also very difficult breastfeeding and she was reluctant to give it up. All this amounted to her having some pretty decent struggles and eventually admitting that she may have PPD. 

She started on anti-depressants or anxiety medicine over a year ago, but it has only helped a little bit. She has tried to come off of them a couple of times, but she can’t. The problem is, they are only sort of working. 

She is always talking about how stressed she is even when there is nothing to be stressed about, she is always tired (2 year old still having sleep issues is partially to blame), and she is rarely happy. This has been having a negative effect on our relationship. I do everything I can to help out when I am home but we both have FT jobs and are burned out by the end of the day. It all came to a bit of a head in the last couple days and now we aren’t sure how much longer we’ll be staying together. 

What other options are there to help with this? Could this just be a permanent thing?",

"Long post, i am sorry. But I hope someone reads.

Where do I start...We have been married 7.5 years. Wife is 32, I am 36. We Have a 5 year old and almost 15 month old boys. Happy, healthy boys. 
My wife hates me and wants to divorce me. I didn't break down and cry when she had the conversation with me, because I've been having that conversation between us in my head every day for the past 8 months since she finally broke to me how she felt about me 8 months ago. I was pretty prepared, just dreading it. 8 months ago it all started out as a random text I sent to her in the middle of the work day that said, I want to figure out how to get closer to you. I was blind sided by her response which was, the more you try to get closer to me the more I'm going to push you away. That conversation continued for a long time, further explaining to me how terrible I am, how I failed her, how she felt abandoned after our first son, how she felt alone after our first son, and how all of that from 4 years ago made her the way she is today. There were other details to the convo. She had some good points. I could have been a better father the first time around, I was trying to figure fatherhood out, she wanted me to read her mind or the situation and just know what to do. I didn't all the time. We had all of those arguments 4 years ago, I would accept my failure, apologize, and try my best to be better and do a better job. I am continuously accepting my failures, apologizing, and trying to get better and improve myself. Well the conversation ended on a bad note. We obviously had problems and I had thought all these problems had been resolved in the past, but now they are back and to blame for how she was.  I suggested that we go to counseling. Her response was that she was not interested in doing that. I was crushed.
Back up to before we conceived our 2nd son. I thought we were happy. We just got done building a house. We finished the inside ourselves and I finished the basement almost right away. My wife started online schooling as a prerequisite for a program she was entering. She was stressed. I was doing my best to support her, watch our son as much as possible, i do all the cooking, and take care of the house upkeep and projects. Early on with our 1st child, I wasn't the best at changing diapers or giving baths. Once I realized my failure, I changed. Since then, I think I've been a good father, I at least actively try to be each and every day. I absolutely love my son. 

So we get pregnant with our 2nd. Everything seems fine and happy. She's excited to tell me, we're excited. Everything seemed fine until 3-4 months in to the pregnancy. Suddenly she started getting more distant with me.  She never let me come with her to any of her dr. Appts with our 2nd. I was there for every one with the first. She was more agitated, overall just less happy, and more stressed. Her online schooling didn't help. I tried my best to be with our oldest as much as I could to take as much load from her as possible. Our oldest at the time would wake up in the middle of the night and come jump into bed with us and we were so tired, we'd let him stay. We'll that wasn't working. We all had terrible nights sleep. Eventually I said this has to stop and I would take our son back to his bed every night and spend an hour getting him back to sleep so my wife could get her sleep. I tried to clean up the house more, rub her feet more. I was constantly asking her if she needed anything, are you okay, I love you, how are you feeling. I would always get very short answers saying I'm good, i don't need anything, and the very routine I love you you too. I didn't believe any of it was true but what could I do? I rubbed her feet as much as she'd let me or want me to. To shorten this up, I tried to be there for my wife as much as I could think how to. 

At this point I wasn't aware of post partum depression and the seriousness of it. Looking back now, this next experience could have played a role in what her ppd is though. She really wanted a girl. We go in to check, and it's a boy! My response was to laugh only because our 1st son is such an amazing little handful. Her reaction was disappointment initially before it just turned into acceptance. I didn't think too much about her reaction at the time.

Fast forward to delivery day. With our first son, when the midwife tossed him up on her chest, her reaction was pure shock, and happiness, and disbelief. All in a good way. When the midwife threw our 2nd up on her chest, i was teared up, but when I looked at her, she turned her face away from me and it was a look of pure anger. I can't in any way understand what it's like for a woman to give birth, but I was a little taken back by her reaction...

She only took 8 weeks maternity leave instead of 12 like she was allowed. She was worried about money. She wanted me to go back to work after taking 1 day off, so I did. My mother in law is retired and is a huge help whenever asked or needed, so I wasn't too worried. It was the same case for our 1st son.  I felt our marriage was getting better through maternity leave. I'd come home from work, try to change as many diapers as I could. I was still cooking every meal, playing with our oldest son, trying my best to care for my wife, tell her how good of a mom she was, asked to get her whatever she needed when breastfeeding, the list goes on. I took over completely baths for our oldest during her pregnancy, and after our 2nd was born, I continued that, and still do most today. We were getting back to laughing a bit more, flirting a bit more, touching more, hugging more, i was feeling better about us. When the last week of maternity leave hit, it was all over. Everything just went downhill. She won't text me anymore without me texting first, won't tell me I love  you unless I tell her first, she won't talk to me in person anymore unless I talk to her first. It seemed/seems like our entire marriage is solely on my shoulders. During our conversation 8 months ago, she told me that she's just angry all the time and everything makes her angry. This really took me back, so at that point I started looking in to ir and looked into ppd, ppr, and the phycosis part too. I didn't know of anything that would relate to ppp, but I was floored while researching that she had 70% of all the other symptoms. And then suddenly dots were connecting in my mind from incidents after our 1st was born too. She has also always suffered with depression and I was shocked to see how much more likely she is to getting ppd because of it. 

I've researched so much, learned so much. I've tried telling her I'm worried about her, only to get laughed at. I try to support her, ask her if anything is wrong, can I do anything. To no avail. I've told her if there's anything I can do to be a better husband and father to let me know....crickets. I try to take her on dates, not interested. Try to start watching a TV series with her like we used to do, not interested. Tried to have uplifting conversations, wouldn't participate. Cooked her her favorite meals, she didn't really appreciate them. I tried and tried and tried. She eventually told me that the only time she's happy is when she's alone and on her phone, mainly TikTok. I tried telling her that being alone was only going to make everything worse. It has. She disregarded it. I put our baby to bed every night, she puts our oldest to bed. As soon as she's done with bedtime, she goes straight to bed and I'm pretty much not allowed to come to bed unless it's after 10. She gets more sleep now than she ever has in her life, but yet she's exhausted and tired all the time. She's on her phone constantly. In front of me and while she's with our kids. She's lost a ton of weight and she's not trying to. She's skinnier than she ever has been since I've known her, and she's not trying to be. She'll switch her personality between me and the kids constantly throughout the day. From happy, to annoyed, back to happy, constantly.

Well our conversation early this week started with her saying we need to talk. Now we've never been good communicators, or good at conflict resolution. I've always wanted to be but it's hard because she responds in anger to so many things, i get scared to talk through so many things.
She started by telling me that I deserve to be loved by someone who can give me love. She built me up, how great I am and everything and I deserve so much more than what she can give me. And said that she's not that person, it's not in her, she doesn't have that anymore. I asked her why she doesn't, and then she goes into all of the reasons I'm such a terrible person and treated her terribly, and made her feel alone and abandoned, and this i why she feels the way she does. Tells me that we haven't been happy since before our oldest was born. I told her that's news to me and that's not true. I told her when I noticed things weren't good anymore. She looked puzzled. She told me it's not fair to the kids to have parents that are never happy and the only option she sees is that we need to seperate. I brought up ppd to her again as I had multiple times previously in the last year. She excused it and said that's not what I is. I pointed out very specific symptoms, she disregarded them. I asked her to do counseling with me. She said she wouldn't. And wouldn't give me a reason why. I told her that I loved her so much and that I wouldn't quit fighting for her. She told me I needed to respect her decision, and that was the end of the conversation.

There are so many details I left out of this long post. I live my wife so much. I don't want to lose her. I'm 95% sure this is ppd, but she has me second guessing if maybe I am just that terrible of a person. I don't think I am? All of her family notices how well I treat her and how she doesn't really reciprocate very well. I'm not trying to trash my wife. I'm just trying to detail what's been going on. How do I help my wife when she doesn't want to be helped and when she doesn't think she has a problem? Does she have ppd? How do I support her. Does everything have to fall apart for anything to get better? I'm a lost husband trying to hang on right now. I want my wife back. We used to be happy. Now it seems like everything has fallen apart.",
Currently 6 months postpartum and I’ve been so depressed. My heart literally feels like it’s breaking into pieces. Any small thing can trigger me and I’m in shambles hysterically crying. I’ve been trying so hard to stay strong for my baby but it just seems like theirs no light at the end of the tunnel.,
"Okay I'm 8mo pp and I feel like every single day I get closer and closer to completely losing it and breaking down, I'm  so extremely overwhelmed and I feel my boyfriend is no help. I have a hard time asking for it to be fair but anytime I do he sighs heavily or groans or makes a face so I just instantly get pissed off and stopped asking for help. He said it's him switching his brain from his current task to what I asked for help with but to a certain degree I feel it's bullshit. I have no choice but to do anything and everything for my child otherwise they wouldn't be so well taken care of. I'm not sure if how I'm feeling is the normal pp rage or if my environment plays a part. I love my boyfriend but I'm definitely feeling resentful towards him cause he gets to go out, drink, see friends and enjoy his personal time. I can't shower until late at night, I barely get to eat and I haven't done my own laundry in atleast a month so it just keeps piling up. Am I crazy or am I just worn down I have BPD on top of this all and it only amplifies my rage and depression. I genuinely feel so alone in this and I just need to know I'm not crazy.",

I'm currently 10 days pp, and having an extremely bad morning. I just had my second baby and going through what I believe to the baby blues..

With my first son, I want to say I had severe postpartum anxiety that cleared up by the 2 week mark. I can't remember exactly when, but it was time for my two week appt with my provider to check on my incision, I remember distinctly having a conversation with her about how I had the blues but was feeling better. I remember being up 24/7 crying all the time and refusing to sleep eat or do anything outside of take care of my son bc of how awful the anxiety was & I think it was so awful because of the lack of sleep..

About 5 days postpartum partum this time, it hit me like a truck the same way it did with my first. I felt like I had ice or fire in my body and just cried because hated the way I felt. I kept replaying how I felt with my son and how awful it was.. The previous days, I would weep only when the sun went down and then after that I would be okay. After the 5th day, when I forced myself to get some sleep, I felt much better..I had some anxiety that lingered, and quite honestly at 8 days pp, I had SUCH a great day that I thought it finally ended for me. It came back slightly the next day but nothing severe. All of a sudden this morning at 6am it hit me again, and the anxiety is coursing through me and hasn't let up. I tried to sleep and for a whole hour I just was in and out of sleep waking myself back up with anxiety, it was awful... I know I've been through this before with my first, in the exact same way, I know that it passed, but had anyone else suffered with the baby blues really badly and it ended by the two weeks?? I'm so terrified this won't end soon and might take longer. I think having a timeline in my head makes it worse bc I expect to feel better by then.

The reason I'm thinking this is just the blues is because I developed a form of postpartum depression with my first a few months after he was born... and it was significantly less extreme. I would get sad and cry, but it never kept me up at night or gave me severe anxiety. And the fact that I dealt with this exactly the same as with him..",
"Hi...just wondering if anyone has advice or words of encouragement. 
Will I ever feel normal again? 
I can't clean my house or shower... I just returned to work. All I do is work, pump breastmilk, and at night I spend time with my baby before he has to go to bed. I literally cannot find the time or energy to clean, cook, shower, etc. 

I'm so sad. I feel so alone. What helped you? ",
"Hi my fellow moms. I’m a first time mom (30 years old F) with a previous history of anxiety and panic disorder. I’ve always wanted a family, and a baby and suffered a miscarriage last year around October which broke me. Me and my husband tried again and a few months later in Feb I found out I was pregnant again. I was so excited and surprised at the time since I had no pregnancy symptoms compared to my first. Fast forward a few months in the pregnancy, I remember taking a shower and feeling panic over the thought of being pregnant and having such a huge responsibility of caring for someone and being a mom. I had a panic attack but my husband held me and reassured me it’s ok to feel this way and that I’d be a great mom. Long story short the pregnancy was not easy. I had horrible pelvic girdle pain and back pain, had to leave my job which left us a financial strain, and unaware to me has elevated my anxiety to a whole other level. 

Now 6 weeks postpartum out of nowhere I started experiencing very dark intrusive thoughts of harm OCD and compulsion and urges. Things that just don’t make sense to me considering I wanted a baby and everyone who knows me has always said I’d be an amazing mom. I would look at my son and visualize him not there or harming myself (which I would never do) and then my anxiety kicks in and I would feel a loss of control and even more panic attacks. I feel depressed, anxious all the time, I don’t eat, I’m scared to be around my child at times, as if I’m a liability or a danger and I can’t seem to understand why this is happening to me. A few weeks ago I was happy, never occurred to me having these intrusive thoughts, happy to have a family and already talking about more kids with my husband and now I feel lost. I spoke to my husband about all this, and went to see my Ob and was prescribed Zoloft. I’m not a medication type of person, never been on any meds always just dealt with my anxiety disorder and was wondering if anyone else experienced this and if the medication helped? Asking for some reassuring words on here from other moms who may have been in similar situations or having a hard time adjusting or experiencing harm ocd and how it was managed and that everything will be ok. Thank you and sending much love. ",
I’m 2 months postpartum with bad ppd. I have been staying home with my daughter doing all the cooking cleaning taking care of her. My husband criticizes me everyday comments on how I look and gets mad at me for having a sad look on my face. He never helps me at night. works during the day from 8-2pm he leaves almost all the baby responsibilities to me maybe changes a diaper every rare occasion. And so last night my daughter wasn’t sleeping and was screaming I was breastfeeding her to calm her down and then I was kicking my cat out of the room. He got up grabbed my shirt and my phone and threw it off the bed and screamed why do have all this fucking shit in the bed all the time and called me a dumb bitch started laughing at me and took the baby and screamed at me to go to the other room and shut the door on me. I was hysterically crying at that point I told him how what he said hurt me he gaslighted me and said I was remembering things wrong. I told him today I have severe ppd when he was getting mad about how sad I’m acting he said I look too many things up and read too much into that stuff pretty much saying snap out of it . I can’t snap out of severe postpartum depression I told him and I said I think I need medication he said take a pill for anything and made me feel like a druggie for wanting an antidepressant. I’m at a lost at this point idk what to do.,
"Trying my best to stay strong and not fall into PPD.  I have a 2 year old and a 6 week old.  Today I admired how independent my toddler is (compared to the obvious) and was so proud of her.  As I held my gassy, crying newborn in the living room, my toddler was cuddled on the couch with my husband.  I had this wave of regret.  I could be enjoying a glass of wine and just hanging out with them if I had not had a second child.  I could be getting 2-3 hours of time to myself and 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep if I had not had a second child.  I wouldn’t be up literally all hours of the night right now had I just stayed on the effing pill.  

I love my second born, but my god I miss sleep.  This second child doesn’t sleep at night.  She will nap during the day but night sleep is impossible.  I was awake with her from 1:45-5:30am last night and idk how I function the next day but by the grace of god.  I’m in the middle of trying to address medical issues like oral ties that are causing gas pains at night… possible dairy intolerance… body work for her digestive issues… I’m EXHAUSTED.  I’m resentful AF of my husband who expects me to do most of the night shift since he works and I slip into a state of anxiety every night as I prepare mentally for no sleep.  It’s torture. ",
"Hey all, 

I just finished Zurzurvae two nights ago to treat moderate-severe postpartum depression and anxiety. Prior to taking this I took one dose of Zoloft and it gave me tremors, suicidal thoughts (with no plans), rocking back and forth uncontrollably and insomnia. Before I took the one dose I had tremors here and there and insomnia with some crying. With the Zoloft if I tried to cry it would turn into a laugh. 

The Zurzurvae worked well for me for the 14 days more or less. I still cried here or there but it was controllable for the most part. 


Now that I’m two days off I’m back to chest pain, tremors, panic attacks with random crying fits and just feeling in a hole. Throughout the day I’ll have moments I’m ok but moments where I breakdown. I have an incredible support system. However, my in-laws are going to be leaving in less than a month and I need to get this under control before they leave so my husband isn’t dealing with this alone. 

I have a call with my psychiatrist in 2 weeks to decide if I should be on a longer term medicine (I am terrified and have been trying to avoid this but don’t think I have much of a choice). 

For context I’m 5 weeks postpartum and have historically been able to manage mild anxiety through talk therapy but this is a new level. The thing freaking me out the most aside from my brain not feeling like it’s mine is all the aches and pains I have being described as normal (aside from the postpartum preeclampsia I had). 

My deepest wish was the Zurzurvae would be all that I need but it doesn’t seem to be the case. Any advice or hope is welcome (medicine related or not). ",
"We have a 3 yo autistic and 1 yo. We moved countries because of economy, he had to go back to the country we moved from to get a visa because evn tho we got married and had children in the country we moved to (home country) the first time visa to stay as a family member has to be done outside of the country. 

He promised He would be back, we were having some issues having a deep connection with all the changes in 2024 and some history and me being focused on being the breadwinner and he the househusband.. everything was fine until 18 days after he left when he started having doubts and asking for time and I was like ""you are away for 3 months how much time do you need"".. and it all came to a stop a few days ago when he cancelled the return ticket I bought because ""he doesn't want to feel pressured about having a deadline to figure himself out""

He is stuck at a deadend job that doesn't even give him enough to live on his own in the country he is in. The child support we have agreed on doesn't cover half of our kids and I had to fight because he wanted to give way way less.. school alone for them is $620 per month. At least that's what I got from him now.. instead of 300 he wanted to send. He only makes 1200 a month, he won't work extra... he was being the main caregiver and he just blindsided me and abandoned us

He doesn't want to give me a divorce because it causes him anxiety to think about it right now, and he hasn't asked much about the kids since I stopped sending updates and waiting for him to ask since 3 days ago.

And I can't leave this country because he didn't gave me any notarized power because he was supposed to come back...

Im struggling..",
"Before I had a kid, I could never understand how a Mom could SC. I would never do it, but I get it I get it I fucking get it now. ",
"Coming up to 2 years postpartum…I feel so irresponsible for having a kid. She is my entire world but I cannot keep up with the demands that come with living anymore. Life is way too hard and I am running on empty. I feel awful for even thinking about leaving her, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. I just feel so hopeless.",
"My wife and I been married for 2 yrs now, we each have a child from a previous relationship. I feel my wife is jealous of me spending time with my child and seems like everything I do I do it wrong. I took a whole month off to be with her and the baby but she says she can't wait for me to go back to work. She often threatens to leave and go back to her hometown. As a father I've tried to be present and I've bought everything she asked for for her and the baby. They don't need anything, but i feel she doesnt appreciate me or the things i do anymore. Any advice? ",
"I never really experienced any big mental health issues after my son was born. But about 3 months ago (he was 12mo), I entered a deep depression and am still going through it. I think part of it could be I’m slowly weaning off breastfeeding? Just curious if it can happen this long after giving birth. Thank you. ",
"I had my son (my fourth child) last June, and was diagnosed with “major depressive disorder” in August. They put me on Zoloft and it ended up making my life a living nightmare. After nine days of trying to “push through”, I got off of it and decided I would just try to fix myself without medication. 

Over the next several weeks I ended up spiraling deeper into the depression and anxiety. Fast forward to October and my OBGYN diagnosed me with PPD/PPA that was on the severe end of the spectrum. 

She put me on Lexapro and it started to make life easier. It also calmed down the panic attacks and helped bring my appetite back (I’d been losing weight very rapidly). 

I’m now 7 months PP and still struggling. I’ve been on the Lexapro for three solid months. And while it has helped improve my quality of life, I feel like my mind is still very unwell.
Every day I’m battling suicidal thoughts and obsessive thoughts about losing the people I love (my husband, my children, and my mom).

My thoughts are very dark. And I feel very fragile…as if one painful event would be my undoing. It’s been a tough two years. My husband is battling cancer, my baby was born with a heart defect, and I found out I was in the precancerous stages of cervical cancer when I was 6 weeks PP.

But nothing has compared to this pain.
I feel broken and scared that things aren’t going to get better. 

With all that being said, my doctor mentioned that if the Lexapro didn’t help me, we could add in an antipsychotic medication on top of the antidepressant.

I’m so scared. I was already very hesitant to get on the antidepressant (several of my family members have a history of alcohol/medication abuse and I’ve always tried to avoid medicine). 
I don’t want to get on a second medication but I don’t know what else to do.

I was meeting with two counselors (at different times) but I’ve had to switch twice for various reasons. I’m currently waiting to meet with a new counselor on Friday.

Has anyone had to take an antipsychotic on top of the antidepressant? I would love to hear your stories. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I feel so sad and alone. I have four small children to take care of, a husband battling cancer, and I don’t know how to keep going.",
"I just need some reassurance that things get better. 

I’m seven weeks postpartum and I’m only now starting to feel some sort of hopelessness. I struggled with emotion regulation during pregnancy and never felt joy of being pregnant among the difficult symptoms that came with pregnancy. 

There was a lot of change that happened all at once. My boyfriend moved in after a year of dating and I immediately got pregnant. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and mild OCD. Medications stopped once I found out I was pregnant and I struggled with control which caused arguments with my boyfriend. I will say that he tried hard to limit these arguments and most of them were started from me. I’ll take accountability for a lot of our arguments but I felt like I couldn’t control when I got controlling and angry. I tried and looking back, I could have tried harder. 

Our baby girl is amazing. I never experienced a love like I did when I first looked into her eyes and she was placed in my arms. I would die for this little human. I felt like I did well with recovery and up until this point but arguments between my boyfriend and I are more intense than they’ve ever been. 

I know it’s adjustment for both of us. Finical responsibility has fallen on him and care for our child is mainly on me. I knew this would be the case and prepared as best as I could. A reoccurring argument that gets brought up is I’m not making him feel appreciated and loved in our relationship. I have a different love language than he does and I think that’s the cause. It’s been so reiterated that when I try, it falls on deaf ears and I know that’s my fault. 

Our lives changed and mine changed long before his did. I was the one who dealt with the emotional and physical changes from the beginning while he got to keep his normal life a little bit longer. I’m struggling with being stuck at home with no source of socializing. It’s really taking a toll and I miss being able to get out of the house without packing up a baby and considering her naps and now long I’m out. 

I know I don’t do enough to reassure my boyfriend and sometimes I don’t take into consideration how his life has changed and focus on just on my feelings. There are other things happening that would take too long to get into but I need someone to tell me this passes. I don’t want to break up with him and it has never crossed my mind but he brings it up sometimes. Whether he means he wants to leave or not, it just brings me down when he does bring it up. He says he doesn’t want to leave but I can’t help but think he does when he says it. 

I don’t know how to express I appreciate him in the way he wants. I have a lot emotions I’m trying to work through and I feel like making sure our baby is taken care of is my top priority. I’m emotionally spent. I feel like he thinks I’m using this as an excuse and don’t understand what he’s dealing with too. I do. I wouldn’t have paid less attention to protection if I didn’t feel like he was worth having a baby with. 

I want to try to better but he doesn’t accept my tries because of our past. I’ve explained all of this to him and it still causes issues. All the pent up emotions are just overwhelming and I’ve cried for the last couple days. I don’t think I’m at the point where I need to schedule an appointment to discuss alternatives but maybe I am. 

Has anyone dealt with this? What were the outcomes and things you’ve done to make things better? How do I not get some emotional and what can we do to move forward. Cause right now we either go backwards or at a stalemate with arguments. ",
"Hi everyone,

I hope it’s okay to share this here—I’m a third-year film production university student currently producing my graduate short film, *Matrescence*. The film tells the story of a new mother struggling with postnatal depression, and our goal is to raise awareness and help break the silence and stigma around this incredibly important issue.

We’ve spent a lot of time researching and consulting to ensure we tell this story authentically and with care. Our team feels so strongly about shedding light on this subject, especially as it’s something that many mothers experience but often feel unable to talk about.

We’re currently crowdfunding to help make the film a reality, and if anyone is interested, you can read more about our project [here](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/matrescence). Even if donating isn’t something you’re able to do, sharing the campaign or offering feedback would mean the world to us.

Thank you so much for letting me share this with you, and if anyone has experiences or insights they’d like to share, I’d love to hear them—our priority is to portray postnatal depression as truthfully as possible.

Sending love to all the incredible mums in this group! ❤️",
"We are approaching 2 weeks pp. 
Bub& I were separated at birth as I needed to go to theatre. I spent that day with him but then he was taken to NICU surgical unit for a collapsed lung. We are 9 days pp at home, finally. But now it feels like my opportunity to bond with him was stolen. And I feel distant from him. I feel heartbroken that our time is finally together again, and yet he doesnt feel like the same little baby I held the day he was born. My family says he is a normal newborn baby. My friends say they are happy we are both alive. But I am so sad. He likes his dad so much more than me and bub is all I have ever wanted. It feels like unrequited love. ",
"Just a rant to get this off my chest. 

After a long day of being a SAHM, (2 year old and 4 month old), doing chores from 8am - 9pm, I tell my husband I’m going to take the babies to bed (they cosleep with us) so he can shower and have time alone. I was running one more load in the washer and he makes a comment about how now he’s going to have to switch the laundry if I’m going to bed. This sends me into a rage because WHAT. 1 - I didn’t even ask or expect him to, I would’ve switched it. But 2 - seriously? You can’t switch the clothes during your alone time? L o l 

I am yelling at him, which I’m ashamed of and regret doing in front of our kids, and starting to cry and he has the audacity to laugh at me. The kind where you’re like trying to hold it in because it’s not the right time. This obviously made me even more upset. His take is that he wasn’t laughing at me, he was laughing because I was “hysterical”. 

I feel so misunderstood and honestly not cared about at all by him. He’s gonna expect an apology for me yelling at him, and I don’t even want to. Why doesn’t he get how hard motherhood is and why can’t he just be a partner that wants to support. I’m so mad and sad. ",
"I’m having an extremely hard time. I love my daughter beyond, but I really don’t think I’m cut out to be somebodies parent. I have no patience, and have a really tough time solo parenting. I feel like I’m drowning in sleep deprivation. 

I had a meltdown today, after a split night, and my dog eating garbage and screamed in front of my daughter and I scared her. I feel disgusted with myself that I let it get to that point. 

I sometimes wonder if she’d be better off without me. My husband is a really good dad and my parents are really involved in her life so I think she’d be okay. ",
"I 21F recently had a baby 4 months ago. I’m suffering badly why does no one tell you how hard ppd is I’ve cried everyday since having a baby every single day .. it doesn’t even have nothing to do with the baby but everything to do with me . I feel so lonely nobody checks on me nobody invites me to do anything , then on top of already feeling like that my boyfriend is mean to me . He helps a lot with the baby don’t get me wrong but he’s so damn mean I feel like he’s seen so much of my vulnerability that he doesn’t like me anymore like how he used to . He doesn’t love me the same , he doesn’t kiss me anymore , he doesn’t hug me anymore he doesn’t act nowhere near the same as before I got pregnant ( we were together for 2 years before ) he acts like he doesn’t like me n it makes me so terribly sad all I do is cry I’ve tried to talk to him about being just a lil nicer to me because I need it most . I need someone in my corner badly  and the conversation always goes nowhere or ends in an argument . Even on my birthday recently 12/19 he was acting like he was mad the whole day n being mean to me and I literally cried n begged for him to be nice to me I BEGGED that’s how depressed I am but of course he just blankly stared at me and said something mean I literally drunk a whole bottle of wine (xxl which is stronger than a normal bottle of wine ) on my birthday and I rarely drink , & of course when other people came around he started to converse n be nice to them . I need love so bad  I just feel like a mom nobody sees me anymore . I just can’t take it anymore I often cry in front of him & he doesn’t even notice or if he does he doesn’t care enough to say anything. Everything I do seems to bother him it’s like I can’t do anything right or he’s yelling at me or saying something to hurt my feelings. I’m so sad n vulnerable I just want him to love me . I’m so young why did I have a baby by him why did I have a baby by someone that treats me like this n makes me feel like this . I’ve often made instagram post or repost on TikTok about my ppd just so I can get his attention and he can ask but he just watches and says nothing. this isn’t like me at all , I don’t feel like myself and I’m so depressed I’m so sad and lonely I don’t know what to do anymore �I often throw hits because I just want him to want to ask n want him to care enough to ask.

"Fuck this shit. I am angry, exhausted, overwhelmed, and most of all in pain. I cannot stand that my body is somehow worse now than when I was pregnant. My son is only two weeks old, and I am in so much pain with my suture from my second degree tear I can barely stand it. 

Everyone said birth would be fine and you’d forget it. But they lied. Everyone said that your body would be able to do it, and they lied again. I had to have a vacuum assisted birth because my babies 13cm head didn’t want to come out of the 10cm hole my body made. I was in labor for 40 hours. And that’s bullshit. 

I tore. I’m having horrible blood clots that are just under the concerning size. They gave me Tylenol and Motrin because I’m breast feeding. But I don’t want to walk, or sit, or lie down or anything. I want to just sleep until everything is better. But I can’t because my son needs me. I love him; but I can’t be any good for him right now. 

How long did your tear hurt for? Am I selfish for being so upset over this? What the hell do I do? ",

"I have severe anxiety, I’m living in my childhood home with my partner and child where a lot of my child abuse and neglect occurred.

I’ve been facing post partum depression too and brain fog possibly from post partym period (I’m exclusively breast feeding my almost 8 month old)

I feel like my partner just gets pissed off when I’m shading my fears with him and he just shrugs or says something offensive so for example I was sharing my anxiety about my memory with him and he just said to me “ I feel sorry for this kid” about my son and this made me feel bad about my anxiety.

I feel alone and I’m waiting for therapy, I feel like he doesn’t understand what it feels like to suffer from chronic anxiety especially his background he grew up with active parents and doesn’t relate to how it felt to be neglected and go through emotional trauma of seeing things no child should at the age I was .

He thinks I overreact and I feel like he doesn’t take my anxiety nor mental health seriously, this causes my anxiety to spiral even more. ",
"Hi all,
I just needed a place to vent. I feel horrible, and it feels like my mental health and overall outlook is getting worse. I had my first baby in November. She’s absolutely beautiful and literally the easiest baby ever. I had a smooth pregnancy, but a terrible birth. Since then my symptoms are:
-Feeling like a failure as a wife and mother
-Doubting my abilities/fitness to be a mom which causes an immense amount of shame and fear
-Hopelessness/doom/feeling like I made a mistake 
-worried about my mental state, as living this way is not sustainable and it feels like a nightmare 
-intrusive thoughts that bother the crap out of me.
-frustrated that no matter how happy I want to feel, my brain will not let me
Does this sound like PPD? I haven’t been diagnosed yet..I just feel so “off.” 
",
"Update: 

Please read anything here if it adds to your data in search for Zurzuvae info. But my case was complicated by a quick benzo taper (8 days taper after 1 year treatment on them), and I couldn't figure out if I was headed for the mental hospital due to withdrawal from benzodiazapines on top of untreated severe panic disorder, or the Zurzuvae, or both. 
As of yesterday, day 6, I did not take the Zurzuvae night dose and don't plan to anymore. My panic attacks on day 5 were Soo severe I was going to be landing in an ER. I decided to go to a slower benzo taper and see where I'm at after that (which will take a lot of time.)

Good luck to all struggling with PPD. I wish I could've given a full picture that wasn't too complex. But my case was too wacky to get a clear look at whether Zurzuvae was beneficial or harmful or what. 


Original post:
Hi! I used to ravenously look around Reddit for experiences with Zurzuvae and came across a few posts that spelled out their experience. I thought I would contribute. I started Zurzuvae yesterday.

I can put real updates as each day goes along. The first thing I noticed is that both myself and my breastfed baby slept extremely deeply last night. 

I also noticed that, despite feeling tired from it, I have this pretty defined boost in mood and a sense of ability to just do things rather than get really dramatic about how hard they are how bad at them I am lol.

That could be a placebo effect, I just don’t know yet.

As soon as my baby woke up, she said a few words in order and this is the first time she’s spoken that way: she’s eight months old. She said very distinctly hello mom, and when I took her in to see her dad, she also said hi dad. kind of freaky! I need to note something controversial here. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder which I started being treated with benzodiazapines in my pregnancy about exactly a year ago. I just did a benzodiazepine taper this past week. This means that my baby's receptors are also going through a withdrawal of some kind just like mine are. The thing about Zurzuvae is that what it does is: it enhances the GABA effect in the brain in and on the same GABA receptors both extracellular and intracellular as benzodiazepines. But it up-regulates these receptors rather than down -regulates them. Part of why I decided to taper off of that class of medication for anxiety is because it had down- regulated my receptors so much that I had to keep increasing the dose of medication in order to control my anxiety levels, and it just felt like there was no end in sight to these increases. I wanted out. So that taper ended two days ago and I was feeling it. It did not feel good. But after taking Zurzuvae, the withdrawal feelings lightened considerably. For the first time in a year, I didn’t wake up with heart, palpitations, and anxiety. We’ll see where this goes! I know that a lot of people had ups and downs with this medicine. They would have really good days and then they’d have a really bad day. So, I am trying to remain neutral and not hope for too much.


Update edit: 3.5 days in
Below you will see a rant on how I was going to stop this medication due to feeling it triggered an outbreak of herpes simplex one. I spoke at great length with my Doctor Who spent actually quite a bit of time looking up the validity of whether or not this medication could’ve triggered such an outbreak. There’s actually a study done that this type of pregnelonone can be more anti viral with this virus if it’s resistant to typical anti virals. She convinced me to keep going but to take high dose Valtrex to get the infection under control. I’m here to say it seems to be working!! I asked my pharmacy to refill the valtrex generic I was taking with a different generic company and that seems to have done the trick. The generic I was on is notorious for being ineffectual so I switched and the medication worked to put my cold sore outbreak into remission.

I’ll continue to provide updates.
Notably, my baby has a cold and is 8.5 months old. This is the first time she’s ever gotten sick. I leave it to the unwritten history of the present and future to come to the conclusion whether scientifically her immune system is negatively impacted by the Zurzuvae in my milk.



2.5 days into treatment:
I am going to discontinue this medication. The reason for this is not because of how it makes me “feel” psychologically. I think it was actually helping me a lot in that way, doing a lot for me in terms of helping the glutamate in my brain and Helping me feel even -tempered. The reason I’m stopping is because apparently since it’s a steroid, it has caused an enormous outbreak of herpes (oral )on my mouth, which no amount of antiviral is stopping. Since a child, even one pill of valacyclovir has caused a cold sore to start to recede. I have taken four doses of this treatment and The cold sores are only spread spreading faster and more painfully. This hasn’t happened to me since I was eight years old and I didn’t have any type of treatment to stop the outbreak. Having this is extremely dangerous for my eight month old baby. And she’s getting this Neurosteroid through my milk as well as being exposed to the herpes virus. I’ve had two outbreak since she was born and was able to stop the attack within hours by taking my prescribed antiviral pill. This is now 2 days Without improvement. The cold sore on my lip appeared within five hours of taking my first dose of  Zurzuvae. ",
"I’m 2 months pp with my second pregnancy and c section (first was twin pregnancy). I was so health conscious my first time with my twins and my body bounced back to the pretty much the same flat tummy. Last pregnancy I gained 70 pounds which has left my belly sagging covered in stretch marks. I get so angry with my boyfriend because he encouraged me to eat what I want and reassured me he thought I looked better bigger (I mostly gain weight on my hips, butt, and boobs) I hate that I blame him. He told me I have to relax more about him “seeing a hot babe” but it consumes my mind. He showed me an example of a girl he thought was cute/pretty and she was so tiny in her waist with perky breasts and I haven’t let it go. He’s so tired of hearing me cry about how much I hate my body now, he tries to reassure me that he loves me and he won’t leave me and he thinks I’m sexy and beautiful. I have so much sadness and rage about it all that I can’t let go and I know I’m pushing him away with how much I bring it up and how much I blame him and tell him he couldn’t be attracted to me anymore. I don’t know how to just focus on bigger better things and think so what if he sees a girl he thinks is cute, so what if I used to be that hot babe, I have beautiful children I brought into this world I need to take care of and I just need to be a better lover so this doesn’t end exactly how I think it will (badly). I’ve convinced myself I will hate my body even more if I lose weight as I hate the idea of having even more saggy skin/boobs. If anyone has figured out how to let go and move on from this type of thing please let me know. This is consuming me and ruining my life and I feel so selfish.",
"Edit: sorry for typo in the title. ""How do I talk""

My online friend had recently given birth, the delivery was very traumatic, she's still in the hospital. Now on top of everything she got PPD. We're in different countries, so I can't offer any other help and support than just talking to her. 

How should I talk to her when she's next time online? Last time she was very optimistic and happy despite everything. After about a week offline her husband messaged me telling she has PPD. So when we talk next time, I don't want to accidentally say something harmful or triggering... What are some things that women with PPD commonly hate hearing, and what are some that they commonly would want to hear? ",
"I’m now almost 8 months PP. Idk what my point in posting here is. I just feel like I need to share my thoughts and experiences with others who may understand:

-Spent years working on my health to be healthy enough to get pregnant (PCOS)
-Sisters son born sleeping in 2019, really messed my family and I up. 
-Had to turn to IVF for conception 
-Father tried to commit suicide in the middle of IVF (found him in time, both he and my mother are somewhat toxic)
-1st transfer works, pregnancy fairly smooth
-Drama unfolds during pregnancy involving unhealthy boundaries with my parents and left our relationship very strained and me very upset the entire time (see prior posts)
-Have a c section, baby is healthy and amazing and my absolute world. 
-not even 3 weeks after having him, I have emergency gallbladder removal that keeps me hospitalized 2 days and away from my husband and baby. Milk also dries up.
-Diagnosed with PPD, already have GAD and OCD beforehand so it all mixes together.
-Definitely have a sleep issue. Insane snoring and feeling like I am never rested. Waiting for PCP to see me so I can get a ref for a sleep study. 

Now I’m here 8 months PP and heavier than ever, struggling to care for myself on more than a surface level, and feeling like juggling work/motherhood/marriage/family is all too much. ",
"I am currently five days postpartum. Every day I feel terrified, especially at night time .things have only gotten worse because my husband went back to work. I have the sense of impending doom like something terrible is going to happen to him. Did anyone else experience this? I’m so scared. I’m also scared to sleep when the baby sleeps because I’m afraid something bad will happen to her. how do I handle this?",
"Has anyone tried cannabis as a way of healing? I'm on my 2nd baby and I started smoking weed about 6 weeks in last time. I don't remember how much it helped or how down in the trenches I was at the time. I'm currently 4wks PP and I can feel myself slipping into a depression at night time when dad leaves for work (he's a bartender). Today, my bf's mom took my 4yo to ""give me a break"", which really just made me lonelier. Therefore, I said fuck this Im willing to try anything at this point and opened my THC pen that i've been waiting to open.

Allllll that to say I feel much better already and im only an hour in...LMAO But I was wondering how many other moms may have experimented with weed and it helped? For context, I am a weed smoker. I only stopped while I was pregnant because I couldn't stomach it during both pregnancies. I simply feel that I'd rather use weed to heal my mental state instead of pharmaceuticals! Much love mamas.",
"My baby is only 9 days old. Out of these 9 days, I’ve had ZERO without being in the hospital, or family/friends coming over to help or see the baby. During the day when he’s calm, someone is always holding him telling me to get some rest. I don’t want to rest !! I want to be with my baby! 
At night, he cries from 3am to 7am so I’m fighting for my life and I don’t feel like we’re really bonding during those hours. During the day he sees and spends time with everyone but me. 
Today I went to pump while my mom watches him and I broke down. I wish people didn’t WANT to come over. Just be happy with the pictures we send you and respect our space. I’m thankful people do want to come see him and help but this is too much. 
I know it’s as simple as telling people no not today, but it’s frustrating to have to say that so many times to so many people in one day too. ",
"Just need to vent - I think this is a big contributing factor to my postpartum mood disorders. 

I’m 11 weeks postpartum from a vaginal delivery where I pushed for 3 hours on my back, had an episiotomy, forceps, and a 3C tear. Just so much trauma to my pelvic floor.

I knew to expect physical changes like stretch marks and stuff. Whatever. But I didn’t realize how my body would change functionally. I feel so disconnected to my body and hate what my labour did to it. I have some fecal incontinence issues, an anal skin tag, hemorrhoids, a suspected bladder/urethra prolapse, uncomfy scar tissue, and have to pee 24/7. I can’t babywear or even lift my daughter without thinking about my body. I feel so broken and dirty. I don’t know if I would have had a child at 30 if I knew this is what it would do to me.

Anyways I’m starting to see a therapist and will hopefully go back on meds too. Just looking for some solidarity. ",
"I never felt like I bonded with my son until he was around 4 months. Of course, I’ve always taken great care of him! And I love him unconditionally. But I hate being a mom sometimes. 
I hate that I’ve scarified my social life. I hate that my doesn’t isn’t a firm and there’s so much stubborn weight. (I am afraid to lose diet excessively because i exclusively breastfeed.) 
I feel like my only friend is my son and it’s a huge blessing. But I miss working. I miss having coworker and listening to their drama. I miss having money in MY bank account. 
I hate cooking, cleaning, and taking care of someone else. While having the expectation to go back to nursing school and be successful without any help. I feel like my husband hasn’t sacrificed anything. My husband gets to work. He’s allowed to go anywhere whenever he wants. He has friends that he can go out without. I feel like the whole thing he’s sacrificed is a little of money. While i took on the responsibility of full time care for our child, being a homemaker, take care of our dog, and overwhelming took on my pre nursing classes. 
Sometimes I get so overwhelmed I don’t even want to take care of my life. I hate being a mom sometimes. ",
"My little lady recently turned 4 months old. She’s perfect. In every way. It’s hard for me to say anything beyond that about her. 
I’ve become quite jealous of the amount of sleep she gets. If only I could sleep for that long, uninterrupted. 
I had a pretty rough pregnancy, being put under short term disability for the last few months of pregnancy as my job is quite active and difficult as a large pregnant woman. I was induced at 39w2d and was then forced to have a C-section the next day due to infection. I was in and out of the hospital for the following month due to infections and incompetencies in the hospital I gave birth in. Luckily, my husband was there to help me (for the most part). 
The following month, right before my 8 week leave was up, my husband had a major back surgery, which brought his father to stay with us for his 6 week healing process. Little needs to be said, other than at that point, I had to not only care for my baby, I also had to care for my husband and his father. While working 12 hour shifts, 4 days a week. 
I’d wake up at 430am, feed the baby, clean the house, prepare dinner for that night, and make sure that everything was in perfect order so that I wouldn’t have to do a lot when I got home. But yet, somehow, even though I had made sure that the house was clean, I’d come back to the same mess as before. (And continue that on rotation for 6 full weeks). 
Finally, after my husband had started to feel better, I could see that he was actively trying to make it easier for me. Unfortunately, his father didn’t feel the same way. I’d come home after my 12, and he’d want a congratulatory cookie as ‘he put the spoon in the dishwasher’. I dealt with it. 
As thanksgiving rolled around, he was still at the house. We went to my brother in laws. With my husband still healing, it’s hard for him to transverse stairs- especially with large dogs attempting to also go up and down the stairs. We agreed to go on the condition the dogs aren’t going to be in the way to trip over. We felt we weren’t listened to, as dinner was held in the basement, with the 8 dogs that were at the house. 
We brought the baby and my father in law had asked to have a picture of his grandchildren. In the beginning, I had told him no. I don’t want the boys (7yr & 5yr) to be holding my (at the time) 2 month old. She is small, fragile and can easily be hurt or sick. 
This was brought up again right around Christmas. I caught a slight attitude because he calls my daughter (whom has a beautiful name and lots of nicknames that could be made from it) he calls her TINK. I told him to use her name. A version of her name. There’s plenty. I am now (according to my FIL) somehow the worst person in the world because I wouldn’t allow my daughter to be called something so offensive to people. But no, it’s “a term of endearment” for him. No, it’s offensive and rude that you can’t respect my daughter’s name enough to even call her by it. He also told me that I needed to respect him more as my FIL. I bit my tongue, as I’ve cut off my parents due to the same lack of respect for me as a human adult, an individual.- and he brought up how “they never do anything for me like HIS family does”. I’ve accepted that my parents aren’t in my life, they are toxic people. At the same rate, I’m not the person that is telling my husband to cut off his family. I DONT want him to lose his family in the same way I’ve lost mine. 
I’ve done everything in my power to be the best wife and mother I know how to be. But yet, somehow, I feel as if I’m not doing enough. 
Does this feeling ever truly end?
Does it always feel as if at a drop of a dime, I could just cry for hours and hours and hours on end?
Sorry for ranting a little bit, but it does feel a little bit better to get everything down on a page..",
"Placenta Abruption. 

I have a history of clots in my pregnancies due to a clotting factor FVL. I’ve had DVT and pulmonary embolisms in both my prior pregnancies. I’ve had the same high risk OB throughout all my pregnancies. My last pregnancy (he’s 9 months old now) was absolutely traumatic. I followed the same OB. She knows my history and even specializes in clotting factors in pregnancy. I had very painful contractions that would show up on the monitor throughout my entire pregnancy. My OB blew me off and even sent me to a social worker because of how often I’d call to get checked out because of my contractions and severe back pain. The point of the social worker was to put together a “trauma plan” because of being gaslit in the past during pregnancy (they missed the dvt and PE in my prior pregnancies) so I had a lot of PTSD… I ended up hemorrhaging in the middle of the night and was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital that was not affiliated by the OB I was following. It was very scary but thankfully me and baby were safe as I delivered 4 weeks early. they suspected an abruption the entire time but confirmed during a pathology exam of the placenta after delivery including a clot in the placenta…. My baby and I are safe which is ALL that matters.. I’m angry. I’m very upset I was gaslit and not monitored more closely. Should I bother to contact a lawyer for negligence on the OB part? 

**my PPD and PPA is an an absolute high this time around. I think it’s bc of the birth trauma and being gaslit. Also being sent to a social worker and thinking that I’m a horrible mom (even though I’m not). 

**forgot to add I had one high risk ultrasound where a different OB told me my baby was small (suggesting something wrong) but told me she was going to fudge the numbers to make it normal. I asked my OB right after this ultrasound and she told me the baby is perfect. Literally even wrote it in her notes. ",
"I have a 14 month old and I am still completely suffering. It’s gotten better but I am still so depressed, anxious and miserable. It’s hard to be around my son. He drives me crazy often. I sometimes dream of running away and abandoning him with his father. ",
"3 months PP today and i feel i am only getting angrier and sadder. First three months baby was in NICU 72 days my feelings and thoughts were focused on my baby the whole time and having lost his brother during birth and traumatic emergency delivery at 27 weeks.. surprisingly i was ok with all of that objectively i was sad i cry a lot pump all day go out most of time for distraction. 

Baby been home now 3 weeks, i cannot stand my husband anymore of how much he complained not getting sleep or missing meals or missing playing video games or working on his car, it feels like he is blaming me because we became parents! I never wanted to be a mom but after how much he wanted to be a dad and how his family is very family oriented he convinced me.. now i regret it, don’t get me wrong i LOVE and adore my son it’s the best thing about our relationship right now but that’s about it. I don’t know if this is postpartum feelings or actual feelings, i am seriously thinking about mentioning divorce as a solution. He helps around but id say only 20-30% of the time and of course the whining and complaining like the baby is only mine not us as a team. 

He judges the way i swaddle, the way i bathe the baby, the way i give medicine literally everything! I am the one who took classes, doing therapy, trying to exercise for mental health and read research all the time i am a FTM i am learning as i go i just can’t catch a break. 

I am tired and exhausted i haven’t seen my family for three weeks now because i am always taking care of the baby his shift with him is only 5 hrs! That’s the time which i sleep ( and pump in between those hours) he sleeps 6-8 hrs and complain. 

Sorry for long rant i am angry and frustrated idk where i can vent :(

"What are the odds of having ppd and ppa in later pregnancies? My Partner and I along with my children want to have more, but I’m terrified of going through ppd or ppa again if we do have another. I just finally think I have gotten over it from my last pregnancy and he’s 5. I had terrible thoughts of hurting myself and others, days where I didn’t feel like myself or sound like myself. And messed up thoughts of hurting my children, this was also in the midst of the pandemic and I was scared they would get sick and die from it. These thoughts shook me to my core and scared me more than anything where I didn’t trust myself to be alone with my children for the better part of a year. I never told anyone in fear they would deem me unfit to parent and take my children away so no my spouse doesn’t know, and neither does my doctors. Any insights would be helpful, thank you. ",
"Im having a crisis and would like to be hospitalized

My baby is well but it makes me so sad he isnt eating and has lost some weight as a preemie, i cant feed him on times I must work and I have a natural fatigue I still need to wake on times and I want to control my emotions so I cant really live my usual life and then tend to a baby like nothing i need patience

He is safe but I want to go out and breathe air and work. I am not sure what to do its more of a generalized anxiety about how I will handle my life from now on after a recent change I made my household work hiring etc

Of course depression is characterized by not taking care of yourself and having no energy and anxiety overworrying so I was wondering how you could master handling your baby. Im freakimg out im a first time mother. I have no way of knowing whether hes healthy or not because I cant even identify his needs. Hes calmer now that he eats more but I thought I had to feed him less due to dyschetzia

I have no friends of value and my parents cause much if not all of my problems. Never had friends and am pretty solitary and never shared a lot with anybody. There is obviously no time to build quality friendships to fulfill what needs to be done on time and all I have is a business. I was wondering if I should hire a nanny Im also on my own, my partner lives somewhere else and works until 10pm. Im concerned I wont be able to fulfill the physical tasks required and the life of a child is on my hands I physically need him to be well. I delivered 5 weeks ahead and Im not prepared. I also dont want him to see me cry or be unwell and get into a crisis those are not things a newborn baby should see. I am not sure where to go or what to do now. Im very concerned. As far as I know you cannot leave a newborn baby alone, or with someone else. Already training workers for different tasks is taking so much of me. I am not sure how I will handle the mess a couole of people left and not begin to hate everything and become non functional again, I feel very afraid I feel like im going to go into a crisis and I need my baby to be safe. ",
"I am a first time mom, 3 weeks PP and having a hard time. I feel like PPD is creeping in. I find my self wanting to isolate from friends and family but this is also partially due to the chance of my baby getting sick. Everyone seems to be getting a respiratory virus or a stomach bug. The thought of my baby, husband or myself getting sick would be the tip of the iceberg. I am struggling with breastfeeding and bonding with my baby. I love him and wanted to be a mom but I guess I underestimated how hard it is. I feel isolated breastfeeding like I am stuck at home and can’t be independent anymore because my baby is constantly attached to me and I feel a bit resentful. I know i am not alone with these feelings but I feel like I can’t talk about it without feeling like a bad mom for how I am feeling. ",
"I’m 4 months pp and my boyfriend and I ended up spiraling into alcohol for a minute there. We’ve now started to calm down and we constantly fight, I can begin to explain how emotionally attached I am to him.. I had been depressed for 4 years now but I was always able to avoide the thoughts and feelings with drinking until I started dating my boyfriend. He then showed me a new life.. showed me my life had meaning and that my feelings were valid.. it was okay to cry and open up to him, but now I feel is falling apart.. idk if it’s just in my head because he keeps saying it is.. but I just feel we’re not gonna get thru this.. I stayed at my dads house with my daughter for one night and my boyfriend hardly messaged me so I couldn’t get out of my head. I was consistently thinking about him and crying thinking my life was over.. I don’t know what to do.. if we did break up I don’t know if I can handle it. I’m constantly thinking and feeling I’m being judged. I’ve had so many friends turn there backs on me and do me wrong in so many different ways. I don’t know who to trust anymore. I feel on my own and stressed out because I’m trying to be there for my daughter but it’s so hard to just pick her up and give her all the attention she needs. I feel like when I do it just feels fake and it kills me even more.. I feel like a big failure and I feel like I know my boyfriend can do better without me.. it’s a pain I can’t explain. I use to be able to listen to music and do my makeup to get my mind off of things but now it seems whatever song I put on I’m never in the mood for uplifting happy music anymore. All I listen to is sad depressing songs.. it seems those are the only things I can listen to. And then that doesn’t help..",
"STM mom here with a 6 week old and a 2 year old.  I was on the fence about having a second after having a difficult first born who I love with all my heart.  She was colicky in the beginning and I fell badly into PPD because of it.

Unfortunately my second born also has colic.  Except this time it’s a night.  My first was during day.  Idk what is worse.  At night you’re stuck- just you and your partner.  Our daughter cries and is plagued with painful gas from the early evening and on.  I tend to break around midnight and make my husband step in while I go cry in the car.  I won’t get into how much we have tried in order to improve this.  Numerous doctor visits, lactation consultant, formula, breast milk, bottles, nursing.. following wake windows, not letting naps go super long, offering full feeds, etc. Not to mention tons of Mylicon and gripe water.  If someone tells me to try gas drops again I am going to scream. 

Things are so bad now I’ve almost given up tracking anything now.  I feel helpless.  As a last ditch effort I am taking her to a pediatric chiropractor and also set up a consult to get her posterior tongue tie and lip tie released.  It’s a lot of $$ but I am desperate for her to start sleeping at night and tired of seeing her in pain with the gas and digestive issues.  

I can’t believe I have put myself through this again.  We had enough on our plate with our first born.  I am total anxiety ridden right now and have an appt next week for my 6 week follow up.  I will be requesting an adjustment to my 100mg of Zoloft I take now. ",
my ppd consists of me feeling like i’m not a good mom and that my son would be better off without me. i think it’s also me reliving my childhood trauma. i could never imagine putting my son what i went through when i was little. i get intrusive thoughts where i just want to kms. i feel like i’m getting to the point where i might do it. i’m going to therapy but even that isn’t helping as much. ,
"I never wanted a second baby. I was fine with one. I know my stress tolerance is low already and my son was so hard to begin with.

He’s two and I had a daughter two months ago. It’s hell on earth. I hate it. She just cries and I just want to put her away anywhere just to get away from her. People want to hold her? Absolutely. Anything so I don’t have to. 
I just finally got back to work from my first. He was finally getting more independent and life was so much better and now I’m stuck at square one and I’m so miserable. 

I was fine with one and done. I really didn’t want her. My husband said it would go away and that I would want her once she’s here and it’s worse. I don’t want her at all. 
She takes everything from me and him. I can’t even leave the house with them both because she’ll make it an awful experience and he suffers for it.
I miss him. I miss being able to just hangout with my son, but I’m stuck with this crying gremlin that I can just barely stand. ",

"FTM here, baby girl is 9 weeks. Things have been going pretty well up until this point but it feels like I've hit a wall. I've been going and going and going and now I just can't take it anymore. We had 2 nights of good sleep and I thought we had turned a corner but now after 2 nights of her being up almost every hour since midnight I feel like I'm going insane. When she wakes up I just start crying - I can barely get back to sleep by the time she wakes up again. I love her so much but I miss my old life, my old relationship, my old body. I'm trying to be positive about my postpartum body but I hate what I see in the mirror and then feel guilty about that hatred. I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this, especially in the winter. My husband goes back to work soon and I'm dreading it because he is my rock. I don't feel like anyone else understands just how miserable I am - I'm ashamed to let them know, or they just dismiss me. 

I don't want to take meds if I don't have to because I haven't had good luck with them pre pregnancy. Mostly I just want to sleep.  ",
"My son is 8 months old, and he is my first. I fucking hate when anyone else but me and my husband show him affection, I don’t know why. How I feel in the moment is “he is my baby. Mine. You are not entitled to him he is not your baby.” I just sit back with a fake smile on my face while I’m screaming inside lol. I know our family just loves him so much but it irks me to no end. I don’t show it because I know that’s toxic but I feel like I want to bite everyone’s head off when they talk to him, want to hold him, KISS HIM (yes my family does even tho I have told them not to a hundred times) I just feel like I cannot fully trust anyone. I just want him all to myself and I know I shouldn’t because he is a human being and deserves to form his own bonds and relationships with his family… but I hate it. � does it get better ",

"I'm three weeks postpartum and trying to scrape my way through the newborn phase. I thought being a mother would bring so much joy into my life, and I feel so guilty about how depressed I am. I'm a stay at home mom, and the only time I leave the house is for doctors appointments. I don't drive, or have a car. I rely on my boyfriend for rides, and he works all the time. Whenever he comes home he either goes to bed, or wants to ""relax"" in the computer room and play video games. Most nights he sleeps on the couch. I keep questioning if I'm doing something wrong. Am I attractive to him anymore? Maybe I'm just too much to deal with. My bipolar has gotten ten times worse after pregnancy and every night I pray for a better day tomorrow. I feel like I have no control. Not over my relationship, my finances, my feelings... I just keep spiraling down. I'm either full of rage or falling apart. My heart hurts. I've never felt so worthless and alone. I try to communicate my feelings to my partner but he always just tells me he doesn't understand why I feel that way and completely invalidates my emotions. Does anyone have any advice or coping skills that helped them? I can't help but isolate because it's what I'm used to when I get this way..",
"This was a much wanted pregnancy after IVF/a hellish journey to get here. 

I am grateful for my son but honestly, when I found out the gender at 3 months pregnant, I was heartbroken; I have experienced so much male violence/SA in my life, and have been scarred by misogyny, that I just couldn’t imagine raising a son. Not to mention having an estranged relationship with my own mother, I wanted to recreate a positive mother daughter bond so badly. I have so many negative associations about teenage boys, patriarchy etc. So much of my identity revolves around being an empowered woman in an industry often dominated by men. So bringing one into the world felt really hard.

The mother-son bond seems weirdly discouraged by society (see r/JUSTNOMIL). So I feel scared I’ll not have an enduring relationship with him anyway, and have no positive template for this.

Everyone said I’d feel differently when the baby was here but if anything, I feel worse. I am on the verge of tears whenever I see a mother daughter relationship on TV, or walk past girly things in shops. I know it sounds shallow but it feels like a dream has gone and I’m now in scary territory.

I’ve been on Zoloft for just under 2 weeks, and had therapy throughout pregnancy, but nothing is working. I feel so resentful of people who “got their preferred gender”. My baby deserves better, but I almost fear bonding with him as so many men grow up to hate their mothers that I feel downright helpless.

I also feel like part of my own girlhood has died bizarrely, like I can’t even fully relate to being a woman anymore if I have borne a son. 

I think going through infertility and IVF really fucked up my brain and made me covet anything others have that I don’t, which has now applied itself to gender.

Any advice, or positive experiences of raising sons?

"As a single mom, motherhood is already extremely lonely. But I also lost most my friends during pregnancy and during my last relationship which was toxic. I have one friend who lives states away from me. I'm struggling to find a job so I'm stuck in the house nearly 24/7. I've tried dating, but every guy I've talked to has used me for nudes and then blocked me. I'm just tired of looking at these same four walls every day.

"My son is almost 5 months old. But it has felt like years. These have been the hardest, worst 5 months of my life. And I’ve been through some things in my 32 years. 
5 months of feeling like every day is hell. Every night is hell. I don’t get a minute to myself. To be me. 

My whole life Ive been rather indecisive. But I always KNEW that I wanted to be a mom. I was always excited to have kids. To raise them. To have a family. I didn’t rush it, but was always excited for that stage in life. I’ve never been a huge baby person, but I love actual kids. But I figured if it was my own baby, I’d feel differently. 

I have PPD. But this depression goes beyond that. It is also situational. 
My pregnancy was difficult. I had every bad symptom in the book. I hated being pregnant. My delivery was terribly excruciating. 
Then, my newborn was extremely colicky and had reflux. The colic has finally started to die down, but, though he is smiley and cheeky, he is still very fussy. This is not one of these lovely unicorn babies you hear about with an easy temperament. I have spent every day since his birth trying to keep him entertained and not crying/screaming. 
The days we’re finally starting to get easier, and then the nights went to shit as the four month regression hit hard. My baby is up every 45mins to 1.5 hours. And will not, no matter what we try, go to sleep before 10pm and will always be up by 7am. I know if I even had an hour or two in the evening and morning to just be me and do my things and spend some time with my husband, everything would be different. 
I wanted this so bad but now that it’s here I feel like I’ve ruined my life. I had an amazing job that was my whole life and identity and was my community and second family. I had passion projects and friends and enthusiasm and a life. Now I have nothing. I’m stuck in the house all day with a screaming baby. I’ve never felt so dark and so bleak. I love my son, and am forever grateful for him, but I just want to feel somewhat alive again. 

If you had PPD or a similar experience, does it actually get better? Did you look back a year later and truly wish you could go back and tell yourself how great it gets? 
I could really use some success stories right now as I feel this desperate hopelessness. 

Oh and yes I’m on meds, I’m going to therapy, I’m taking vitamins, and I’m on some naturopathy supplements. Ive really tried everything :( ",
"Hi all,
Struggling deeply and profoundly at 7 weeks pp. I had such an amazing pregnancy, and was so excited to start this new chapter with my husband. All those feelings evaporated after my birth experience. I labored for 20 hours, developed an infection called chorio, and had to have an emergency c section. The entire thing made me feel like such a failure, and watching my husband be able to care for our baby while I was in pain made me feel useless. I also lost my mom 4 years ago, so a major resurgence of grief has been bubbling to the surface. I just keep thinking how much support she’d be giving us, help, and love in general. I have such an intense longing for her, and I cry every single morning. Because I’m so sad, I feel like a burden to my husband. I don’t feel like my fun and vibrant self. I suddenly feel insecure and like any woman would be better than me for both my baby and husband. Since my mom died, I isolated myself over the years and I’m entering motherhood with borderline no friends and also a very shitty support network. I’ve never been so low in my life. I’m scared to die but I also don’t want to live either. No, I am not planning anything. But I do get why some women are pushed to the brink. I just don’t see a light. Nothing is going to bring my mom back, my personality feels profoundly fucked and changed which could ruin my marriage, and I’m not just going to magically have a support network/friends. I’m alone. If anyone has words of hope, I need them today ",

(I tired Lexapro years ago and did not like the weight gain aspect so I knew going into post partum that I didn’t want to do Wellbutrin). I recently decided to stop my Wellbutrin because I was feeling happy again. I thought I was okay. But about a week or so ago my husband and baby caught a stomach bug and it was awful. I was taking care of both of them and I was so exhausted. My daughter also went from sleeping through the night to waking up at least once a night again and I think maybe this triggered my ppd again because I am sitting here sobbing as I type this, and convincing myself that I’ve ruined mine and my husbands life. 

I never thought I’d feel this way 6 months pp. Is it perhaps the fact that I stopped my medication? Maybe I stopped it too soon? Maybe I’m not okay just yet. I want my nights alone with my husband again. I want to be able to get some decent sleep. Please tell me this is temporary. ",

"When I had my first it felt so magical, and was one of the happiest times of my life. 

Nowadays I just feel numb. I don't know how to juggle my toddler and baby, cooking and cleaning. Instead I want to sleep and cry all the time.

Baby prefer dad and he screams everytime I try to nurse him. I feel rejected even though I know it's not logical. I know I should try to stop breastfeeding because it makes me so sad that it makes him sad. Yet I long for the bond I had with my daughter. 

I don't get to spend a lot of time with him because I feel like I have to cook, clean and take care of toddler that prefers me. Then he rejects me when I try to connect with him. It makes me want to run away and hide.

It doesn’t feel like he sees me as his mom, I feel like I'm a stranger to him and he's a stranger to me since he doesn't seem to like me. I worry I will never connect with him and lose out on my bond with daughter too since I'm unable to be fully present with her either. 

I know for someone that is in a good mental space this all sound crazy, I shouldn't put all of that on a baby, who can't even sit up without support, yet it feels so real. Do anyone have any tips? I've gone on ssris in the past but they only make me feel even number.",
"I wanted to post my experience with Zurzuvae since when I was researching about it I could not find anyone who had taken it for the complete two weeks and had any update on how they felt after. I took it for two weeks and it has been a month since I have taken it. 

**Background** 
I am 30 years old and I had a healthy easy pregnancy and a positive delivery. I felt a slight sense of depression when I got home. I felt overwhelmed and I felt like at night I would get the night scares. I also was very tired and the lack of sleep really got to me. His cries made me what to shut down, but at the same time felt my heart racing. The witching hour/purple cry really got to me and I could not care for my son for two days I remained in bed and did not leave it. 
My OB does 2 week postpartum checks as well as 6 week postpartum check. At the 2 week appointment I took the depression survey and as soon as I saw her started tearing up and she told me I was moderately depressed and rx zoloft. I took zoloft for a month and felt like it did nothing so I stopped it. I continued to be depressed, but high functioning and tried to suppress it. Then I rejoined therapy and was told about Zurzuvae which I was interested in once she told me it was only a two weeks treatment. 

**The process of obtaining Zurzuvae**
My therapist reached out to my OB who then asked to see me. When I saw her she talked to me about the side effects the main one being central nervous system depression. She recommended I do not work for two weeks since I am a nurse and to definitely not to drive for two weeks and informed me to take the medication with high fat dinner at night. 

Once I decided to go ahead and take it. I made arrangements to have my mom fly in from out of state to help me and my husband took time off/wfh to help as well. I got the prescription and had my insurance cover it since it is a specialty drug it cannot be picked up at your local pharmacy. In my case it was the specialty cvs and they mail it to your house. This is the part that I wish someone had told me **from getting the rx to me having it in my hands it took 1 week** so in my case my mom had to stay an extra week because I did not have the drug. I just assumed I could pick it up the next day. 

It also cost me $5,000 with my copay! But when I called they told me the manufacturer discount would bring it down to $0! So make sure you talk to your insurance/pharmacy. 

**Taking the drug**
I took it at night with a high fat dinner (eggs, salmon, avocado etc) and I would take it around 8 pm after putting my son to sleep. The first night it made me drowsy and I fell asleep after 30 mins. The feeling of the medication throughout the two weeks makes you feel like you are drunk (hence the no driving and working). It made me feel drunk during the day and dizzy probably until 1 pm and I did not feel like myself until 4 pm. I did not work for two weeks because I am a nurse, but even if I was not I do not think I could work and function regardless. I went to an orientation for 3 hours for work and I felt like the powerpoint presentation were going fast, but I was being slow. I felt like everything was going quickly and I was going in slow motion and just felt dumb to be honest. I drove a short distance 5 mins on day 13 in the afternoon and I felt so confident that I could drive and once I did drive I was like this is not safe. So please do not drive on this medication. 

**Did it work?**
Day 1-2: I felt like my depression got worst. I was crying 2-3x a day which I had not done in a while. I felt like a failure for taking this drug and felt like a burden to my husband and my mom for taking time off and flying in to help me. I felt sorry for my son for having a mom like me and just cried looking at me. 
Day 3-7: I just felt the same way I felt before the medication. Depressed but highly functional not like day 1-2 where I was truly the deepest depressed I have ever been. 
Day 8: This is the day that it hit me that I did not have that feeling or voice of depression. It had quiet down. I felt a sense of relieve, but at the same time was worried that this feeling was fake and my mind was playing games with me. 
Day 9-14: I consistently felt the feeling of getting better and it  plateau to a constant feeling of normality and that voice and anxiety had decreased. 

**Final thoughts/updates a month out**
I think it was worth it and it saved me. I was moderately depressed, yet highly functional. I felt a sense of doom and did not enjoy my son to be honest. Now after taking the medication I feel kind of a sense of being robbed of time since I took the medication postpartum 9 months. I look back at photos of my son when he was younger and feel like I could have enjoyed it if I did not have the depression. 
It truly felt like night and day for me now. I find enjoyment in being a mother and feel like I only made myself more miserable by not seeking more help before. 
Now when things happen I am not spiraling or getting mad. My husband is no longer tip toeing around me to make sure nothing triggers me. No when things happen with my son that would have easily upset me before does not affect me. I just breathe through it and I am able to power through. This is when I knew the medication had worked. I had this fear of the what if it doesn’t work? What if I had my mom fly in and my husband to take time off only for it to not work? But that is when my husband told me what if it does? And if it doesn’t we will find something else. But in the end it did. I am glad I was able to finish the treatment as it truly did help me. 

**please feel free to message me if you have questions. You are not alone and you are a great mother**

I’m having a hard time connecting with my husband after having our daughter. He’s counted how many times we’ve had sex this year and constantly reminds me bc it hasn’t been a lot. But I don’t really have a sex drive and when we do have sex I feel like I’m just doing it to please him and I’m not really into it. Part of it could be that I’ve been so irritated it’s almost turning into resentment. Ive brought my issues up to him before and he acts like I’m either being a brat or tries to let the day go by and hope I forget. Very anti confrontational. Our LO is 6months now and I have PPD that comes and goes in waves. The only thing that keeps it at bay is staying busy and getting out of the house every other day. The few times I’ve wanted to go out with my friends he’s guilted me into being home by a certain time and acting like I’m immature for wanting to be out all night when I’m the one whose here with her the most and sometimes need a break. Meanwhile he has gone on multiple trips for fun or out with his friends. The only time I ever asked him to come home I couldn’t stop crying for no reason and wanted to see him and he said he’s almost done golfing which then lasted 3 hours. He travels for work a lot and his schedules unpredictable which makes me feel like a single parent at times. I started therapy and she suggested having him come and it’s been 6 weeks because of his work schedule. It makes me mad bc I feel that he puts work ahead of everything and when I bring it up he tells me that we wouldn’t have what we do without it. I understand sometimes work has to come first but staying out at a bar because other people want to entertain you is not important imo. He doesn’t FaceTime every night he’s gone which is fine but when I go out he makes comments ab me not wanting to be with her. He made me feel horrible through my nursing experience bc I wasn’t making a lot and I was so exhausted and stressed he read articles ab how to increase supply which was thoughtful but pressured me so much. When I said I don’t want to do it anymore he said he had a say and I told him they are my boobs and my decision. I just feel like we are on 2 separate trains trying to get to the same goal. I don’t want to hurt his feelings but he isn’t listening to how I feel and pushing it off like everything is fine and for me it isn’t. I just feel so out of love now and idk how to get that feeling back ,
"He says having a baby changed him and he doesn’t know what he wants anymore. But I know by his cold demeanor he will be divorcing me, I also just have a gut feeling. I am a STAHM and completely depend on him financially. I am so fucked ",
I’m 8 weeks PP and the depression started creeping in a few days ago and is now in full force. I’m already on Zoloft and my doctor upped my dose today. I am constantly crying and don’t know how I can care for my daughter while in this fragile of a mental state. My husband has been amazing during this time and taking on more and letting me sleep but it feels like nothing is helping. I don’t feel the same happiness I felt a week ago about spending time with my daughter. I feel like all day I’m just waiting for it to be the nighttime when I know she will sleep in between feeds and at 4am my shift ends and I get to officially be off duty for 7hrs. I feel horrible for feeling this way. I sobbed while changing and feeding my daughter last night and I just feel ashamed of myself now to the point where I feel this immense guilt when I’m holding her and looking into her eyes that this is the mother she ended up with. Just came here to vent and see if anyone had any words of encouragement for a light at the end of the tunnel. Or how you managed to get through the days feeling so down. ,
"I'm so tired I just want to have a break but no one is giving me one. We are spending two weeks at my mom's house and I thought that I would be able to take a break but no I still have to do everything. I'm the only one changing diapers, feeding her and putting her to sleep, I can't even sleep in the morning because they will bring her back to me if they thing she is tired without even trying anything.

I spend my entire evening trying to get her to sleep while they enjoy a movie, I just want to rest I can't do this anymore. We had 8 hours of train to come here and I had to take care of her during the entire time because she is crying with my husband.

I hate my life so much when will I be able to just have some time for myself without having to think about anything?",
"Any mom out there that is struggling with postpartum insomnia? I am currently 11 weeks PP and I just don't get sleepy. You know that feeling that you're dozing off well I don't get that. I've never struggled with sleep issues in the past. I've always been a great sleeper. I miss getting sleepy. Btw I have slept, sleep ranges from 4-7 hours per day. But I just simply don't get sleepy. I don't know if I make sense or not. No one understands what I mean that's why I'm seeking someone who can relate and got through this. I just miss that feeling of feeling sleepy. ",
"I am almost 5 months into my pp journey. I was doing ok.. for the most part my overthinking, tears and rage had dwindled after about 2 months. I wasn’t feeling back to my normal self by any means, however I didn’t feel like I was going to lose it on my husband after every little thing he did or I wasn’t going to cry over small things anymore. 
However, my period came back a couple weeks ago and I’ve been a mess ever since. I’ve been very emotional and sensitive and have spent a lot of time crying. 
Did anyone else find things got harder once they got their period back? Also, I breastfeed and thought I’d get more time without a period so that’s a bummer. ",
"I need some advice or help, idk. I am 7 months pp and have been back on the pill for about 3 months. I’ve just been so angry at everything lately. I came home yesterday and my dog destroyed my pantry and kitchen and just had a complete breakdown. I have never yelled as loud as I did (not at the dog just in general) I also hit my gate that blocks off the kitchen about 4 times so I wouldn’t hit my walls. Then today I snapped at my husband who didn’t deserve it, went and took a breather then came back in the room and started joking around like instantly. Then he asked me about it and I broke down crying. My hormones are a mess and idk what I should do. Like I can FEEL myself raging but have no ability to stop when I’m going. I don’t like feeling like this, I’ve never been like this before and don’t know where to go from here. Please help ",
"Hi I am 37weeks pregnant woman. 
I haven’t had sex for 3weeks with my partner. I can tell he is frustrated about it but somehow he manages his sex needs( libido).

We talked about our sex life after birth. 
His concern is we might be sex-less couple after having a kid. He said he really want to avoid it. His libido level is very high, mine is a bit higher than average. We sometimes even enjoyed kinky things before I got pregnant. 

He thinks I can have sex 6weeks after birth. But I found articles about postpartum-depression. Even if I don’t get this symptom, it might take a long time to get my libido level back to normal. 

So…here is my question, 
How does everyone manage sex life with husband? ",
"Hi, I am a mama (27) of a 4 year old & a 6 month old.. I feel like I had finally gotten out of my ppd from my first child, and even had gotten off my SSRI’s. Then I found out I was pregnant with baby #2 and I was over joyed, and he has been a great baby, but I’m starting to feel overwhelmed, lonely, and sad again.. 
I have hardly no time to myself (literally just showering after the kids are asleep, and basic hygiene, then I stay up late reading and feeding/rocking my 6 month old). 
My husband works 8-8 5 days a week, and every other Saturday, and we hardly see him. I’m starting to just feel like a nanny.. I should also add that we live in the boonies and there is nothing and nobody around here to do or see. 
Also, my in laws are living with us and I feel judged 24/7 and just want my own space again..�
I want to start working out again, but there’s no gym nearby and I feel like if I do workouts at home I will just be interrupted by a crying baby or distracted by the 1 billion things on my to do list..
Anyways, I just wanted to vent because I have nobody to talk to and feel like my bottle is about to pop. �
Thanks for reading. ",
"Hi I(23F) am 1m pp and I’m exhausted. My fiancé(22M) wasn’t able to get parental leave so the whole time I was in the hospital and even now he has been working and hasn’t been home very much. When he is home he has worked all day and just wants to play his game and won’t help me with anything he won’t help me change her, feed her, put her in her car seat, he won’t even hold her for more than 10 minutes. I tried talking to him about the fact that I feel so lost I have no idea who I am and I’m just sad all the time and all he had to say to me was “you need to stay strong for her” and “you need to get your emotions under control.” I feel so alone and sad. Part of me hates the fact that I got pregnant but I love my baby so much and I hate feeling this way… I hate feeling so alone and helpless. I hate the fact that now I feel like the one person I was supposed to be able to lean on for support I can’t talk to about how I feel because to him I’m just being weak and overly emotional for no reason. I feel like I’m losing my mind trying to take care of the baby and the house and make sure that he is ok and happy. I just want it all to stop… does it ever stop? Or get better?",
"I’m 5 weeks PP and I thought it was normal to still be feeling this way but my OB thinks I should be progressing faster and that I need more help as well as a break. She called my psychiatrist and they both want me to go to the hospital. My OB said there’s an IV medication that helps with PPD. I am very nervous and hesitant to take their suggestion. I know the medical staff isn’t always nice to people in the psych center. Furthermore I don’t know how I can possibly leave the baby that long because with my spouse working full time child care will be difficult, and I know this is silly, but I’m afraid people will judge me (like my parents and MIL, and they will have to know about the hospital stay as they will be needed to assist with the baby if I’m not around). Has anyone ever been hospitalized for PPD? What was the experience like? Did the medication help? I want to feel better and the idea of a break from my baby sounds nice (as horrible as that sounds) but I’m really scared for all the reasons listed above. 

Edit for clarity: the doctor said it would be a stay at the hospital inpatient. I’m worried it will be hard for my spouse to find full time child care for the time I’m there since she works full time ",
"I’m 26 (F) I have two boys a 5 yr old & 9 month old. I live in a small one bedroom, one bathroom apartment with my spouse. I feel like I’m constantly cleaning and can never get anything done. I’ve tried it all. Checklist, Apps, someone watching the kids while I just clean. But can never seem to finish. I’ll start one room then go place something in a different room then start up on that room and I feel like I create an even bigger mess just trying to clean the first mess. My spouse helps me as much as he can but sometimes I feel like he half asses everything that I end up having to redo everything. I know this is stupid but I seem to never be organized, my house is always messy! Then I get so overwhelmed I start to lash out on everyone and don’t want to clean anymore. Am I still in postpartum? Is it just depression? ADHD? Idk I just want to have a nice home to walk into!

"This is my third bout of depression following pregnancy. First time I didn’t link it to postpartum depression because it followed a miscarriage in the 1st trimester. I recovered 8 months later when I started bupropion. 

Second time, I had severe ppd, plus ocd and hypomania after the birth of my daughter. This was despite staying on bupropion during pregnancy and trialling about 12 medications postpartum. The second time the depression lifted only in month 7 of my third pregnancy, when I stopped all meds, including bupropion. 

I’m into my third bout. Baby is 6 months now. I’ve truly tried all the lifestyle advice and classes of medications. I don’t think there is any treatment that I’ve not tried that might work. I’m just hoping time will resolve it. 

I’m struggling with my marriage. I have a husband who has two kids he has to parent in his own condo every other week. I am unhappy with the situation but there is nothing that can be done except me ending the marriage. We’ve done counseling looked at different custody situations etc. I don’t think I’m well enough to be on my own or even to make that decision right now. 

I’m drowning and feel hopeless. I see no way out. I feel alone in every way, even when I’m with friends or family. ",
"Hi all, this will be long so I really appreciate anyone reading long! I had my first baby in April 2020 and had terrible PPD and OCD for 18 months. It took that long to start to feel better and the road to there was horrendous. I felt like I was locked out of my life, couldn’t feel any positive emotions etc. But when my daughter turned 18 months or so, I felt myself coming out of it. Since then I’ve been pretty much recovered, except for some anxiety and lingering OCD. It took me a long time to even consider having a 2nd baby because I was terrified of it happening again. 

Fast forward to last December 2023, I had my 2nd baby, who arrived 5 weeks early. He spent 8 days in the NICU but came home very healthy & happy. Despite some initial anxiety, I had the most wonderful first year with him. So much so that I was considering a 3rd baby! I felt like I had totally healed the broken part of me that was robbed of that experience the first time around, we had an amazing bond and I felt so much joy. I had huge issues with guilt for *not* having that experience with my 1st but overall, it was a great year. 

Cut to 2 weeks ago and I was due back to work from maternity leave. I’m in Ireland so was off for nearly a year. I had anxiety about going back to work as my son is EBF and I’ve only spent a few hours away from him. My mom looks after my daughter who attends school now and was also taking my son. I work remotely so they were downstairs, not even far away. That first day I had what can only be described as a total mental health crash. I was extremely anxious and started experiencing derealisation. Everything felt weird & foggy. I pushed through till day 2 but it got worse. I could feel myself declining rapidly so I went to my doctor who agreed I was medically unfit for work and signed me off. I don’t know what’s happened but now I have this horrendous depression. I can’t feel my connection to my son or ANY positive emotions at all. I’m existing but the colour has gone out of life, I’m not enjoying anything. I’m absolutely devastated as I’ve gone through this during my son’s first Christmas, like I did with my daughter. I’m on meds as I never came off them during my 2nd pregnancy. I do think I’m burned out from the last year where I took zero time for myself, despite having a supportive husband. I’m back in therapy in January but I just feel so scared, alone and distraught. Could PPD happen nearly 1 year postpartum? Please share your experiences & stories, I feel so heartbroken.  ",
"Hi all
3 months pp here and I am feeling very low.
I have been diagnosed with harm ocd in past but since I had my baby I was feeling fine.
Few weeks ago I got into a spiral where I feel extremely anxious and sad and terrible intrusive thoughts that scare me so much and create me so much discomfort 
Before having my baby I was super scared of getting pp psychosis and I am scared I am having it now as I can’t break the cycle.
All I do is cry and cry and I read here a post of someone getting admitted for having intrusive harming thoughts towards their baby and she wasn’t allowed being with baby on her own and I’m terrified right now.
Today I feel very hopeless and the intrusive thoughts are scaring me so much
Just want to hear everything is normal and this will pass and o will be ok
Or even to hear someone experience 
Thank you ",
"Context: My husband has always been so obsessed with me. Always very patient, kind, soft, loving, and such a good provider. 

After having my baby (8 months ago) I was going through a lot. Trying to balance a marriage while also trying to be a mother while also trying to take care of myself. I was also very particular about how things were done with my son and I probably didn’t come off very nice to my husband (who is a very hands on father btw) I wasn’t very nice to him, never name calling or yelling just talking down to him. I never realized how much I did it until I realized he was unhappy and told me how I made him feel. I have been making a conscious effort everyday to be better, but also really struggling with my own internal battles at the same time. 
He says everything I do just seems fake. He is so cold towards me and tells me he doesn’t know if he can look past the way I made him feel in those few months. I was battling so much and truly at my lowest. I completely lost myself in motherhood. I am not the wife I once was but I am really fighting to work through that. 
Our relationship/marriage has always been so easy.. we’ve never had to try or put in effort because it’s always been so natural to us but with a baby it’s a whole different story. He thinks it’s been long enough since we’ve had a baby and we should basically be getting back in our groove by now but I think otherwise. I think it takes more time than just 8 months to try and figure out how to manage a baby and a marriage at the same time. 
I feel really sad that he tells me he sees me differently after seeing me at my lowest postpartum but I know he is going through things too. He is actually debating on divorcing me over it. I guess I never realized how much I hurt him during those months but I wish he would be more understanding of what I was going through or of what I am still going through. I do all the night wakes because he works so I can stay home so I haven’t gotten solid sleep for 8 months.. I hold some resentment but I’m trying to let that go and work through it but he says all I do is make him feel guilty. He really is such an amazing man, husband, and father but I fear I have pushed him away for good. I don’t know how to save my marriage. This was a lot to unpack, I just needed to get it out. ",
My baby is 5 months old. I’ve been suffering with insomnia and have looked after him but not engaged like I should have. He now won’t meet my eye.

What can I do or is it past hope? Please help. ,

"Hi everyone,

My daughter is 8 months old and sleeping pretty well (she wakes up 1-2 a night usually) but every time I'm taking care of her at night I just can't sleep. I'm trying to calm myself and even if I'm exhausted Im just not able to fall asleep at all.

For people who had the same issue what helped? Im taking an AD (Vortioxetine) but it feels like it doesn't lower my anxiety level enough for me to sleep, I'm wondering if a change in meds is needed (I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a few days so maybe I can bring that up then) or if there's some tricks I can try to be able to take care of her without being an anxiety mess

Thank you :)",
"I’m just here to vent because honestly idk where else to vent about this sort of topic. I recently just got released from a behavioral center because I was having thoughts about harming my baby. I went to the ER immediately and my daughter is with trusted family. Id been taking Zoloft since August and I saw no improvement whatsoever. It actually made things so much worse. Today wasn’t any better and we’re getting ready to have dinner and celebrate Christmas Eve. I feel like I should be happy like everyone else but I just feel sick. I can’t even look at another baby without thinking about how other parents can look at their baby and smile. I know that sounds horrible but I’m not sure what to feel anymore. They put me on more meds and maybe my body just isn’t used to it yet. But I’m tired of taking so many meds and I feel empty. I’m not allowed to be with my baby alone anymore as requested by her pediatrician. I’ve never harmed her physically but at the same time, I kinda get it. 

I went to the ward willingly because I know what I’m feeling isn’t normal. I cried every time I told the doctor why I was there. I love her but I’m just not happy like I used to be when I was pregnant. I feel like I sound harsh because it’s not my baby’s fault. It never was. I’m still practicing my safety plan to make sure my baby will be safe. If things get better, I’ll be glad. I’m going to give my new meds a chance and pray that everything will be okay. I have an appointment with a therapist on the 19th so I’m looking forward to that. Thank you if you even read this. I know it’s a lot but I thought writing out how I felt would help me express how I feel. The nurses taught me about good coping mechanisms like this one. Anyways thank you again.",
"Hi guys, first time posting here! 
I’m a FTM to a 9mo and my best friend is also a FTM to a 7mo, but our PP journeys have been very different, her baby was a lot more demanding while I had it easier. 
Recently she has changed her behaviour a lot, not picking up the phone, not returning messages/ calls, avoiding meeting up, not even responding in group chats she was very active previously. I suspect that she might be avoiding me because I have a considerably easier time with baby, and there might be some subconscious resentment.
Obviously I understand life changes after having a baby, but I’m a bit worried about her and suspect that she may be experiencing PPD. She’s trying to make everyone believe her life is amazing and she loves life with her baby girl, so on the few occasions I’ve tried to ask if she’s okay she gives a vague answer and never really shares anything but I can see she’s not as happy as she presents.
Which comes to the point, what can I do to support her? I want her to know she is loved and supported whatever she’s going through but I don’t know how to “reach her” anymore.

Any suggestions and advice welcome!! Xxx ",
"I’m 6 month post partum. I had a C section. I also had a post partum hemorrhage and post partum preeclampsia. In addition to that, before I delivered the nurses did a cervix check while I was delirious and not fully conscious.

I didn’t remember them doing it, and when they came in the room I was preparing myself to get the check. (I always had to prepare myself because the process was so uncomfortable because of my history with SA and rape.

I said, “is it time for another check?” They said “oh we already checked a few hours ago.” I was silent and then said. “While I was sleep?” And the nurse said. “Well you weren’t sleep. You were just out of it.” That made me feel so weird because I told every nurse about the SA so they know to have patience with me.

That’s the background.

Present day, 6 months later, I’ve been dealing with all of this mental stuff alone. 

I’ve been waking up not knowing where I am. Live feels like a fever dream and I can’t distinguish what’s real and what’s not sometimes. Even in my dreams, I am taking care of my baby. He is the only constant I can remember. 

Am I going crazy?

I do not work. I’m a SAHM, and his dad covers all the expenses.",
"Is it possible to have PPD two months after delivery? I’m a FTM and just not sure about what’s going on. My son was born prematurely and was in NICU for two weeks, I was discharged after two days. During those two weeks I was so heartbroken that I couldn’t take my baby home with me. Once I got to take him home it was great. I was so happy to have him home I didn’t even mind the lack of sleep. Everything was fine up until a few days ago. I suddenly started feeling super sad, I’m starting to lose interest, I can’t sleep, I can’t keep up with my self care, I have to force myself to get up to clean and make dinner for my husband and I. My husband works 12 hours a day and I know he’s already stressed out about paying everything so I don’t want to add on to his stress. I did recently start my period so I’m not sure if maybe it’s just that or if it’s depression? ",
"Hi based in Dublin Ireland

Really bad and low mental health - it’s come to a head especially today. I’m 4 months PP and I have a great bond with my little boy and love him to bits. Really struggling though mentally- suicidal thoughts, wanting to self harm and intrusive thoughts too. It’s not consistent, it comes and goes for a few days at a time.

I think I need to see a doctor, but there’s no availability over Christmas. If there’s anyone based in Dublin (south) that can recommend any services or anything I’d really appreciate it.

Context- no friends or family here. Just my husband who works a lot ",
"Tw: suicide


I posted here about 2 months ago, I was not doing well at all and since then I've been trying to get better, got on meds, went to the hospital for a week, was put on sick leave (I'm still not back a 100%) and well it got a bit better until it didn't..

I was the sole provider of the household but my husband got a job offer a few days ago, the problem with it is that it's shift work.. meaning I will be by myself to take care of our daughter most of the time now. I cannot sleep when I'm taking care of her. Like right now she's asleep next to me but I didn't sleep a wink. I don't know how I'm supposed to be taking care of her by myself (and go to work myself)... The thing is my husband struggled really hard to find this job so it's not like I can tell him to refuse it because it's also very hard for me to be the sole provider so there's no good compromise.

So now, I just don't know how I'm supposed to survive, I feel like it doesn't get better and I have no choice but to put my feelings aside and take care of everything. And I can't. I'm so freaking tired of it all, I feel like I can't breathe.. I realise that I'm kinda preparing to die, like I'm soaking it in when I'm holding my daughter or when she wraps her little fingers around mine, I've been telling her I'm sorry, I've been researching how I could proceed etc. I talked about it with my husband, I told him that I wanted to die and I think he doesn't know what to do but I don't either.

I don't really know what I'm expecting out of this post, I guess I just want to feel like someone understands what I'm going through ",
"My husband and I have been really struggling after having our son. (8 months ago) 
For context, my husband has always loved me so so much and I’ve never questioned that. He has always taken such good care of me especially early postpartum. We have always had such a strong bond, always laughing together, and always flirting. We were so solid.  

But Suddenly there’s been a shift, he acts like he fucking hates me. He hates the sound of my voice, my face, everything. Of course he has never said it but I can just tell he does by the way he looks at me. When I talk, he is uninterested. When I dress up and look hot, he is uninterested. He tells me he doesn’t know why he can’t be happy in the marriage anymore. I am trying everything I can while at the same time trying to find myself again after having a baby. We are not doing well financially either, my baby weight will not fall off, and I am just feeling like I am at the lowest point I’ve ever been at. I have nothing going for me either, no education above a HS diploma and no job. I feel absolutely worthless. I feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t even know why I’m posting this, I guess I just am tired of feeling so alone. All of our friends and family think we are so happy but we are both fucking miserable. ",
If you are dealing with postpartum and dealing with getting use to your new mommy body. You’re not alone ❤️ I’m here for you mamas. We’re all in this together �,
"My baby is about to turn 2. New parenthood has been way more challenging than I imagined. I'm falling apart. I'm miserable. Every little thing is so so hard and I have to force myself to do anything. 

I love my daughter more than anything but I feel like I'm failing as a mom, and as a wife. I can't pull my weight. 

I've made an appointment with my doctor and a new counselor. But I know both of those will take months to have a noticeable effect.

I went back to work after 12 months mat leave but I don't think I can keep working. My husband and I have both been working all year and caring for our daughter. We have no child care, no grandparents around to help. It's not working. Everyday is such a struggle for me, I've never cried this often before and my husband has been picking up my slack and he just can't do it all anymore. 

I feel so much guilt, and disappointment in myself. I feel like I've failed as a mother, wife, and at my career. I just don't know how to let go of those negative feelings towards myself",
"Has anyone successfully got their husband to truly understand what you’re dealing with when it comes to lack of sleep? Currently 7 weeks post partum and travelling for the Christmas break and he looks at me like I have two heads when I suggest I want to sit out a visit to a relative or friends house in favour of a nap at home while the baby sleeps. It’s like he’s forgotten what it takes (this is our second child). 

He’ll say something naive such as “I’ve been looking forward to the christmas holidays and thought we’d be able to x y z together”. Well I’m not sure why you thought our newborn would magically sleep through the night just because we’re on holiday, buddy. 

He’s always asking “why are you in a bad mood” if I happen to snap or act short tempered. I explain to him it’s because I’ve had such little sleep for seven weeks and he’ll respond with yeah I’ve had it hard too (he deals with our toddler at night which we all know is not the same as responding to a newborn) and I honestly feel like a pathetic whiney broken record trying to get him to understand that I’m actually doing it tough 24 hours a day ",
"Hi everyone! I’m a 25M husband to my beautiful 24F wife, started dating when we were 19 and got married 2 years ago. A little backstory before I get into it. About a year into our relationship we both started talking about kids in the future and she expressed she had a fear of going through postpartum mainly because Bipolar depression runs heavily in her family, she’s been in therapy since she was 14 for her anxiety and said her therapist told her she hasn’t shown any signs of BPD so when we found out she was pregnant both of us kind of went in with high hopes and positive thoughts, thinking everything would be fine. 

The pregnancy went smoothly, some mood swings here and there but nothing too rocky. And then 9 months later she’s just popped out our little girl and as soon as we got home from the hospital it was like an instant shift in her energy. She’s naturally a calm and laid back person, but this time I could just tell the difference between them. Our conversations were short, she responded with one worded answers or shook her head yes and no when I asked questions. She just went completely blank all around. It was like talking to a wall.

One night I sat her down and tried to talk to her and she just broke down, and sobbed, screaming crying for hours. It was so heartbreaking that I started to cry as well, she’s never cried in front of me like that before. She had cried herself to sleep and the next morning I didn’t want to rush her or make her uncomfortable by asking what happened last night so we never ended up talking about it

Fast forward to last week and she’s doing her usual one month check in “she’s had to switch from weekly to once a month since the baby”. The room she does her sessions in is right next to the laundry room and I was in there grabbing clothes and I overhear her crying. Obviously as a worried husband I stop to listen and I hear these words “I feel so guilty being here. I don’t know why god gave me a child, I feel like I’m not deserving of motherhood, I just can’t be here anymore. I’m so tired” and more suicidal thoughts that she’s had.

I need my wife, my daughter needs her. But god would I do anything to take away her pain and carry that suffering for her. I just want to see her smile and laugh again, I want her to feel beautiful, and loved because she deserves the world. My heart just breaks for her, and as a husband I feel like I should automatically know what to do. But I don’t. I’m so stuck.

So for any mothers out there that have dealt with something similar what can I do to support her? No wrong answers",
"My baby is 6 months old and I loce her so much. We're breastfeeding and she basically only feeds to sleep/contact naps so, with that and okaying, reading to, weaning, all the stuff,I'm basically with her 24/7. The only time I ever get any chance to do something productive for me is if she's asleep on me. Her dad takes her when he can but that time is showering/cooking/cleaning so hardly a break. He's working 2 jobs and is exhausted so I always make sure he has some time every day to persue hobbies amd have alone time and I try very hard not to resent that. I love him and he's an excellent dad to all our kids. I'm just currently in the weeds with the baby which I expected.
What I didn't expect was how much she doesn't like me. When she sees her Dad she sobs to be held by him, she only ever reaches for me for boobs. She always has the biggest smiles for him and when I try and babywear to take her out or do chores she is miserable unless she's feeding/asleep.
I make sure when I'm hanging out with her that I'm focussing on the baby, the tv will be off and I'll play with her or read to her or just generally work hard to keep her engaged but all he has to do is hold her and she's overjoyed. I cry about it every single day.
My body is destroyed, my hips are still in agony from the pregnancy and I've lost zero babyweight
I am so bored and unproductive all the time. I'm stressed and exhausted. I get it and can cope with all of this, this is life with a baby. 
But life with a baby shouldn't include doing all of this all the time for someone who honestly wouldn't care if I wasn't around if not for the boobs.
I just don't know why she dislikes me so much.",
"Single married mom here… 31F and 8 months PP. I was diagnosed early on with PPA and PPD. It was a mixture of hormones, past trauma, my husband 34M checking out, and  job related PTSD (last responder care). I’m on Zoloft now and attending therapy (group and individual). Although my spirits are lifting and I’m receiving the much needed help things are still the same with my husband. We had a great relationship prior to our LO being born which is why I moved in with him, got married and had a baby with him! I was very adamant about not wanting any of that with previous partners until I met my husband. Yes, we had our moments but we overcame it all with ease and conversation. 

Now… I don’t even know. I’m the primary parent to our LO and homemaker. I endure the restless nights, feed, bathe/dress, attend all doctor appointments, and financially provide for our LO (we have separate accounts) including all the cooking and cleaning. Hell! The first two months I lived on the couch while he had a full 8-10 hours of uninterrupted sleep in our bed. Not even a diaper change! Like most of us… I went without food, sleep and showering. Going to the bathroom was a task in itself. 

But moving onto why I’m here in the first place… holidays. Thanksgiving was a doozy - he was sloshed by dinner time and LO started teething. So, I was really looking forward to Christmas. This will be LO’s first Christmas and I was really looking forward to spending the day with family. We typically have a nice brunch, play games, and lounge around while catching up since we all live apart. 

I told him literally for weeks in advance how excited I was and looking forward to LO’s first Christmas. What I was planning on making and asking him for suggestions. After all that… he booked tickets to watch a movie with a friend on Christmas day. If everyone lived closer and we didn’t have to travel that morning to meet with everyone, I would have been okay with him stepping away for a bit while we all lounged about. But we have to travel 2 1/2 hours the day of - no, Christmas Eve is not an option because of work schedules. He booked his movie tickets to a theater 30 minutes away from where we live, mid afternoon, and made plans to hang out prior to/after the movie like he usually does with this friend. 

I know LO will not remember their first Christmas but this year was rough… I was looking forward to seeing all the family and having my little family there, too. 

I won’t let it damper my mood but it sucks knowing that we’re not a priority. I could argue and fight about this with him , but I can’t force him to be a father or a partner…

"Hi all,

I am going through PPD and I’m really scared that I won’t overcome this. I’ve been so up and down. I’m not at all excited for my birthday (which is today) or Christmas (usually my favourite time of year). It’s baby’s first Christmas and I feel like I’m going to let her down. She’s 7 months old and is a beautiful happy baby. I don’t feel bonded to her which really scares me. This isn’t like me at all. Our house is a disgrace and I would be mortified normally but it just seems so overwhelming. I have an amazing husband but it’s really hard on him. My parents and friends are supporting too. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m on medication and seeing a psych (who is on break over Christmas). I feel like something is wrong with me. I don’t have energy or motivation to do anything. Everything feels like a chore. ",
"I’m finally to the point where I want to take medication to fix my postpartum depression and anxiety. I am constantly on edge. Fear of my son getting sick has had me isolating for 11 weeks. I randomly have intense feelings of doom and sob uncontrollably.therapy hasn’t helped and I work out every day, eat healthy, I’ve tried everything. 

I probably would’ve started sooner had I not been terrified of the idea of taking care of a baby while dealing with the side effects. I’m already so exhausted how can I get MORE fatigue? Or these scary vivid dreams? 

Has anyone made it through the side effects? 

I was on lexapro at one point earlier in like (like 2018 and I was 23) I vividly remember being at the mall and feeling like I was barely awake, almost in a dream state during one of the first days. But that’s all I remember about taking it.",
"Hi amazing community, so grateful for this safe space to share our stories and experiences without judgement.

I have a 5 week old and 3 weeks ago begrudgingly increased my Lexapro dose, I was taking 5mg for several years and am now taking 10mg because I am struggling badly postpartum.

I had a few ‘honeymoon’ days on it within the first two weeks or so but the last few days I’m in a dark hole, and this time with in reader anxiety too. I do recognize that this is likely the adaptation period but when you’re in it you feel like you’ll not make it.

I’m looking for success stories on how long it took and getting through the other side and feeling better.

I’m speaking to my psychiatrist tomorrow so this is not medical advice I’m seeking, purely anecdotal collaboration.

Thank you and stay strong ❤️",
"Wife was diagnosed with PPP. Admitted into a mental hospital. She doesn't want to have anything to do with me or her two kids whom are 4yrs and 3 months old. She doesn't want to talk to me nor any of her family. I'm basically holding on and trying to keep everything together as I've been left alone with 2 kids and can't work. I don't know how long more I can keep going. 

She's taken Christianity to the next level saying all she wants to do with her life is serve God while calling everybody else's a witch or a sinner including her own mom. She's been saying funny things like rapture is coming this December and she's been seeing visions and all. 

I just feel it's all getting too much for me at this point especially as she's been in hospital almost 2 weeks and literally no major improvement as she's still insisting not to see her children. And I have to resume work in the newyear with no idea of how to deal with childcare. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? ",
"Just as the title says- my partner of 4 years was on the fence about having another baby (we have 2 already ages 5/9) and finally decided to give it a go for number 3 and it has been a disaster since month 1 of my pregnancy this time I was extremely sick with hyperemesis daily then needed my gallbladder removed near the end of the pregnancy so he was on doing so much extra for the other 2 kids while I was sick (other pregnancies no issues) and now we have an extremely fussy/colic 8 week old baby which is also different form the other 2 children. My partner is so distant-moody-cold and obviously hating his life with us now. I have PPD and him being so unhappy with our family when things were wonderful before baby #3 is making my depression feel all consuming. Nothing I do makes him happy and I can tell he regrets the baby and almost his entire life with me/us now? I’m hoping this is also a depression bc things have been so hard for the last year but it’s starting to feel he resents ME bc I’m the one who brought up having another baby. He literally basically ignores me now, will help with baby but seems so checked out emotionally from us I’m worried our relationship isn’t going to survive and it’s been 8 freaking weeks. I just feel like a complete failure and this is my second marriage and my first husband checked out at the end in a similar fashion (always on his phone the “nothings wrong” but distant and avoidant). Just feel like my worlds falling apart and I love our new baby so much I don’t want him to be impacted by any of this stress or depression. Just feel like I’m drowning and want to run away from it all. Thanks for whoever listens ��",
"Hi, I know this is wrong, but I’m the partner of a post partum mother and I am nearing a breaking point. Our pregnancy was normal, with some hiccups, and I was very supportive and present the whole time. I don’t see this as a chore, I am excited for parenthood. Labor and delivery was very hard on my partner and I have been trying all I can to be at their service.

"Hello, I’m 2 months and half postpartum. And I’m thinking of getting divorced after being married for a year and half. Reason being I don’t feel loved. When I was pregnant my husband would tell me I was beautiful when I complained about my weight gain and we were doing the deed until I was like 4-5 months pregnant. But since I gave birth he hasn’t called me beautiful once. The ‘i love you’ has become ‘love you’. The hug he gave me before he left for work or somewhere else seemed awkward, the ‘should I go in for a hug’ type of hug. He doesn’t seem interested in me unless I talk about our baby. He would rather masturbate then do it with me, and I addressed that to him and that I’ve been sexually frustrated too, he said he just needed to clear his mind for work, that was 6 weeks postpartum. Then we got intimate again for like a few days, when my mum was in town helping with our baby. Then it stopped again and I thought it was because my mum wasn’t here to help, but now that she’s here again, and been here for a week already, and our baby has been in her room, we still haven’t gotten intimate. I wore new nightgowns and stuff and it seemed like he didn’t at all. We have been arguing a lot after I gave birth, and he keeps saying we have to stay together for our baby. Since we got married we only went on a holiday just the two of us once. We spent our engagement celebration with his mum, my wedding wasn’t even about me but his friends, the whole time I was getting my makeup done I had to keep looking at my phone sorting transportation for his friends, then we spent our honeymoon with his friends and family, and again our wedding anniversary with his family. We were supposed to go on holiday together just the two of us today for two days, and let my mum stay at our house and mind our baby. But then I found out a few days ago that the schedule of our holiday consist of him going to the gym with his friend, and us having dinner with his friends. So I got upset and told him he could just go by himself then if that was the goal, so we argued, and he called me selfish. Also he had a pre Christmas party organized by his workplace which he didn’t bother asking me if I wanted to go with him, though he knew my mum would be here that day so I could go but instead he said he assumed I didn’t want to go. I asked him if he still loves me and why. He said yes and because I take care of our baby well, just that… no other reason. I don’t think it’s enough, at least not for me. Would it be selfish i decide to get divorced because I don’t feel loved? I don’t want my baby to keep seeing the unhappy me, I want him to see the happy me but I need to feel loved by my husband which at the moment it seems impossible. I’m lost, I feel like my life is over. I quit my job to be a stay at home wife, and lost my identity along the way. I love my baby so much, he’s so young, like he wouldn’t remember those time I took care of him… but I’m finding it hard to stay alive. ",
"hi. i don't usually make reddit posts but i needed to get this off my chest. (i hope it’s ok to post here).

as the title says, i’ve been institutionalized. i’m currently waiting to be taken to my room as a write this. 

my partner has been manic for a month and completely detached from reality. now he’s in another hospital. i’ve helped him in the past but my ppd/ppa made it so i can not be there in ways that i once was. especially now that i have to take care of our daughter. it is difficult as a lot of his delusions right now involve me being against him. regardless of what i say or do, it is taken negatively. 

this stress of his delusions and hospitalization combined with financial struggles, relationship issues, and family illnesses/deaths in the past few months have become too much. i realized i cannot be there for my daughter. i thought i could be strong for my child and my relationship but i can’t.

now my daughter is with my mom (which i am so so so grateful for) but both of her parents are in different psych wards. i feel absolutely terrible for putting her into this situation. i knew i was at high risk for ppd and went to therapy and took medication but it was too little too late. i truly believe, even now, that i need to die because it’s my fault her life is so chaotic. i feel terrible that i barely mentioned her in this post because i am so focused on my own issues. but i’ve learned that ignoring them doesn’t help either (as now i’m here). 

idk what to do or why i’m writing this. i have a small circle and needed to confide. somehow. i have no idea what my daughter’s future looks like. i just want to get better for her. i’m scared and worried for her dad/my partner. but focusing on him is not going to help me get better now. thanks for reading this if you did. i appreciate it.",

"I’ve been in a relationship with my husband for 8 years, we married and had our first (and only) child this year. Our daughter was born in April, she’s now 8 months old. 

I was diagnosed with moderate/severe PPD at 2 weeks post partum, I experienced some horrific thoughts and feelings as well as quite substantial difficulties bonding with my baby. 
Fast forward to today, I’m now medicated and under the care of the perinatal mental health team. 
My depression is slightly better, I am mostly stable, albeit with the occasional drop in mood and tearful day I can get on with my day to day life fairly well. I have a fabulous bond with my daughter now; and I do believe I am her favourite person as she can spot me a mile off and greets me with the biggest of smiles. 

Recently, myself and my husband have been bickering. He works full time and also works extra shifts to earn us more money while I care for our daughter 24/7 (including all of the night wakings). My husband’s states that he is stressed, and thought that things would be different by now and that I would have recovered. 
I know full well that the journey to recovery is a long and rocky road, filled with a lot of setbacks and potentially relapse. 

I don’t know how to make him understand how I’m feeling, I often hide my bad days and don’t really discuss my thoughts and feelings with him through fear of adding additional stress. He also states that he is really tired, and although I do appreciate the amount that he works, he appears to disregard that raising a child is also a full time job, and I’m waking up through the night with our daughter while he gets a full nights rest. 

We both love each other and by no means am I suggesting that our relationship is at stake, I just wondered if anyone else has been in my shoes and maybe had any ideas on how to make him understand that this isn’t a choice, I am unwell, depression is an illness and that maybe, someday, things will be as they once were.

"I’m a mom of 3 ANGELS I love them so much. 
I have a 6 year old, a 20 m old, and an 8 m old 

After my third I had a spinal leak that went untreated for 5 weeks, they thought it was depression and took me cold turkey off one antidepressant and onto another one, I feel like that ultimately prolonged everything. After my spinal leak was treated I had my tubes removed. So I haven’t had much available time to get back to normal. Here now are the holidays and I’m so exhausted and everything with two small babies feels almost impossible and I always feel like I’m neglecting someone and it eats me alive. I don’t think act or behave like myself, my husband and I have had so many issues since my third was born and it has left me feeling so isolated and abandoned. I’ve thought about therapy but I don’t have a village and my husband isn’t really available to watch the kids for me to do anything for myself and i hate the idea of even asking for help from anyone anymore. I just need to know there’s a light at the end of this very long tunnel and I need to shift my perspective to a more positive one and I’m having such a hard time. I feel like I have no control over anything. ",
"Hi guys,

I'm a first time mama and by the title you should know that I have no one to talk which is why I've resorted to reddit. I'm 10 months postpartum with my beautiful baby boy and I couldn't be happier to have him choose me as his mama. The way he smiles at me just instantly clears my head of any of the thoughts I'm having. He's a cute little velcro baby who literally can't stand to be held by anyone but me and his dad on occasions. That being said, I'm burnt tf out and extremely lonely. I moved from NYC to a whole other country across the world to be with my family to support me through this new stage in my life. The same way they supported my brother with his first born. That being said, things are not going as expected. The village I thought I had is pretty much non existent and it hurts. I witnessed my mother be a grandmother to her first grandkid and was so excited to bring my own life into this world to see how she would treat him, but he isn't getting half as much attention as my niece and my mom uses the excuse that he's a ""mammas boy"" and that she's getting ""too old"". I've also been seriously hurt by my sister in law who is a manipulative snake. She gave birth to her second baby around the same time as me giving birth to my first and completely ripped the moment away from me. Didn't let me have a welcome party for my son because she wanted to have a welcome party for her son around the same time. She also complained to my brother that my mom wasn't helping her when my mom explicitly told her that she would help her once she made me food. My mom had offered to make me food because i was sleepless with a colic baby and also had stitches down there so could barely move which made it hard for me to get food for myself. My brother comes up to me after his wife complains to him and starts yelling at me asking me why I couldn't wait to eat because his wife needed help and no one was helping her. I immediately lashed out and started crying hysterically while I was breastfeeding my baby. At the time, we were all staying at my mothers but once that fight happened, I packed my bags and left. So ever since then I pretty much haven't been getting the support I needed from my family. My husband has been helping as much as he can but even he's burnt out. We haven't had sex in almost two years and I physically cannot have sex because the nurse at the time of my delivery over stitched me so I need to go back to the hospital and get a reconstructive surgery so till then we haven't been intimate with each other and that's also causing some trouble between us. We've tried to go on dates before and left the baby with my mom but she called us and told us that she couldn't do it and that he was crying hysterically because he only wants to be with me so since then we haven't had time alone. I just feel like everything is falling apart and I'm swimming back up for air at this point...",
"As the title says, I am 3 weeks postpartum after a one month hospital stay after I PPROM’d at 25 weeks. Had my LO at 29 weeks via c-section. I am now home (FINALLY), but having a hard time adjusting to not bringing a baby home. Tbh, all things considering, my baby is doing amazingly well. She is breathing and eating on her own which is a huge accomplishment. I have healed very well and i’m doing overall well adjusting (helping around the house, getting back to how it was before, etc). 

I feel a lot of guilt when I cannot go to the hospital. I have my days where I’m feeling okay with it, then I have my days where I feel so sad that I can’t give her the skin to skin she needs. I have also been feeling extremely tired. Like, sleeping 12 hours and then taking a 3 hour nap. I don’t even have a newborn home. Why do I feel the need to sleep this much? I ate for the first time earlier and got extremely nauseas. This is a new symptom for me. These symptoms are way different than what I experienced with my first kiddo, so I’m having a really hard time coping/finding coping mechanisms. I haven’t been diagnosed with PPD as I have not been to my first PP appt…but I have a feeling it’s in the magic 8 ball. Blah. Thanks for listening if you read this far. I feel better getting it all out there. ",

I started eating “healthy” (low calorie diet) and now the doctor said that the baby is not gaining enough weight probably due to a low milk supply. I feel like it is all my fault because i havent been eating a lot and I feel like such a failure . How do you deal with PP nutrition while feeling bad about yourself ??",
"I had only left to go to the bathroom for about five minutes, I come back and My husband decided to scream at my son, because his iPad was too loud, and my husband couldn’t focus on his video game, my husband made him cry, so I admit I did definitely scream back at him and and I did say nasty things back,

And his first instinct and response was to call me fat and ugly? I don’t understand how he out of all things that’s the first thing he said? I’ve been on a glp-1 for 4 weeks and lost 10 pounds and I really thought that was good enough and now I feel like I’m spiraling,
I have no friends, I have no family, my parents are currently in mourning because my grandmother passed this week,I don’t want to bother them with this. and I’ve never felt so alone in my life, 

My husband plays the video game from no exaggeration, 10am until 5 am, he’s no help with the kids, if he washes the dishes I have to have it shoved in my face for days, if he takes me to the movies I have to hear about it,
He screams all day long as loud as humanly possible at the game, yet my son’s iPad was too loud? I’m so exhausted. I’m so finished and I think I’ve never hated him more than I can right now,

He leaves me to do all the cooking, cleaning laundry, and taking care of my children full time, not to mention I have a full time job at home. 


I’m very frustrated and I can’t stop crying. I want to leave him so badly it’s unbelievable. ",

Hi so quick question and long post. 

I had a baby in August and since then my body is not the same. I need to know if anyone has experienced something similar? 

A backstory: 
About 7 weeks postpartum I was experiencing a light green discharge. Went to the dr. And was told I was fine. Did a bacterial panel, STD panel and all was clear. I went back a month later with persistent green discharge and now pelvic/uterine pain and cramping. Was told I’m fine and it’s a physiological change to pregnancy after further bacterial testing came back negative. 
I felt like something was wrong and got a second opinion. I was placed on prophylactic antibiotics for the green discharge and an US was ordered. Finally, this month (4 months later) I was told again I’m fine. I did a transvaginal US along with another bacteria/STD panel and everything looks clear with the exception of some trace free fluid in my uterine cavity. Which my doctor told me could pose no issue since my US was clear otherwise. 
The only issue is I still have the discharge and pain. The discharge happens at least once every three days. And pain is daily. I would describe it as varying from sharp to dull to cramping to achey. Nothing triggers it and it’s affecting me working out, having sex etc. 

I should add I had ICP and discovered to have preeclampsia at my birth that went undiagnosed due to hidden symptoms. Otherwise healthy pregnancy and baby. 

I just feel sort of hopeless since I’ve been cleared from a gynecological standpoint and was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar after having their own baby. 
This is my first baby. I was completely healthy otherwise. So to be struggling with this postpartum is really bothering me. I would also be lying if I said I wasn’t experiencing any anxiety about these persistent symptoms when it came to the discharge and pain. I just want to know if anyone has experienced the same thing and got better over time?

"Hi, all. I had my first child (a boy) exactly two weeks ago via c-section. I am struggling bad with PPD. Anxiety, depression, not bonding with my child, etc etc. I **just** started Prozac, Buproprion, and Estradial (spray on the arm). Has anyone had any experience or luck with that? OF COURSE it can take up to two weeks to feel the affects of the meds so I’m holding on, hoping and praying that it works. �� also want to note that I’m pumping, but not breastfeeding because of all the medication I’m on. I hear that can make PPD worse??? Let me know of your experience if any with these medications and PPD. ",
"Hi all, new to this sub and new to parenting. FTM 28. 

I dont know if I have pp rage, depression, or anxiety or a fun combo of all three but I feel like I’m drowning. I do have a history of mental illness, mainly depression and anxiety led by my bipolar disorder but I haven’t felt like this in years. I would also like to preface, I love my husband he is a good man. So if you feel the need just keep it to constructive criticism. 

I’m struggling really hard with being a mom, I love my daughter ( a month today!) I never even thought I could get pregnant, but I am exhausted, touched out and at my wits end. When she’s not using me for a pacifier, she’s eating, then sleeps for a short period before waking up absolutely pissed about any number of things. Hungry, gassy, just wants to be held, a dirty diaper (which she’s even more pissed to be changed, don’t really get that but okay). she is a fairly good baby, I definitely wouldn’t classify her as colicky, she just is a well a newborn baby. But I also can’t get anything done, right now in the main caregiver as I’m EBF and my husband works full time as we discussed me taking a full 3 month maternity leave. It’s also RSV season so I’m isolated at home, I’m sick of looking at the same 8 walls (bedroom and living room) everyday. My poor animals are getting neglected as by the time that they actually want attention I’m so sleep deprived or touched out that I just want them away from me. I feel horrible because they just look at me like I broke their hearts. I’ve been having issues with my supply, it was my fault I wasn’t being consistent because I was desperately sleep deprived and my bipolar is really bad idk I don’t get sleep, so I’ve become angry and defensive over that. I literally cried over spilled breast milk last night because it was the last 3 oz in the fridge and I was just done being touched for a little bit but then had to feed her anyways because I spilled it. I’ve been having severe upper back pain that’s ruining this stage for me. I don’t wanna hold my daughter because it makes the pain 10x worse. So instead of enjoying my newborn snuggles I can’t wait to get her off me. Which in turn makes me feel so guilty, because I haven’t enjoyed any of it. I didn’t enjoy pregnancy because I was sick or in miserable pain the entire time and now I’m not able to find the joy in being a mom. Don’t get me wrong I have my moments where she’s off me and calm and I’m so overloaded with joy I just cry because I love her so much and I’m so happy, but the times I’m not make me feel so bad. 

My husband helps when he can, he’s totally down to go to work sleep deprived so he can stay up and settle the baby, or feed her if I have milk pumped. Anything with the baby he’s all in for, but he’s stopped caring to take care of me. I know I’m a big girl and I can care for myself, but I’m so busy caring for another human I don’t think about me other than survival. Eat, drink water, pp care, sleep. Sometimes I’m not even eating because I can’t get to the kitchen to make myself something because I have a baby attached to my chest or who refuses to be put down and all the food we have has to be cooked in some form. If I want something from him I have to ask. Which I guess is fine? He will do anything I ask with out hesitation, but sometimes I just don’t want to expend the mental effort to ask him to do things. I just want him to see the need and fulfill it. We’ve got boxes and trash piled by our front door because he won’t walk it to the dumpster, dishes that need to be done, a dishwasher that desperately needs a clean because it smells like death??? I’d like him to get up and want to make me breakfast because I’ve explained 65 times that I need it (this was an issue over pregnancy as well and he wouldn’t make me something till I was physically ill every morning). I want him to want to sweep, mop, and vacuum the floors, pick up after himself to not add to the mess, ask about me and how I’m feeling, offer to rub my back before I complain or am in tears, just simple things. I don’t want to have to ask for every little thing. He knows this as we’ve discussed it, and I feel bad for putting so much on him, but I just need him to take care of things so I can focus on the baby and myself. It’s just me and him. My mother lives 2-3 hours away and we are for the most part estranged, and my mil while only 40 minutes away is sometimes overbearing, sweet as can be and her and my FIL  have done so much to help, I just don’t want to sit with them while they coo over the baby. I feel so horrible that I’ve become this mean rage filled person in my relationship, but I don’t feel good. I’m tired of being asked stupid obvious questions by my husband who’s just unobservant, I’m tired of asking for every little thing, I’m tired of being tired, I’m tired of being home 24/7, I’m tired of the acne, feeling ugly and being frustrated by my husband loving on me and trying to make me feel attractive by making out with me, because it just reminds me that I have maybe another month of recovery before I can do anything sexual with him. I don’t want to tell him he can’t do things he enjoys to unwind from work or be his own person, but I feel totally alone and I want him to want to not do anything else. He’s a gaming YouTuber so he often plays games or is recording or editing a video if he has any true free time. 

I feel guilty that I have a mental health disorder that requires sleep for me to be able to manage it well and I can’t sleep because I have to take care of her. I feel guilty that I’m not enjoying this as much as I should, that I haven’t enjoyed ANY part of my pregnancy or postpartum at all. I feel guilty that I don’t enjoy breastfeeding. I feel guilty and like a failure I tapped out during labor. I feel like a failure and guilty because her rooms not even done. I cry at some point in the night every night and sob because I feel so bad about so many things. I just feel horrible and now I’m pissed off all the time too. 

Sorry this was so long I just needed to rant maybe to people who would understand. Because no one in my life I can talk to would get this. Any advice? Anyone in solidarity? Or have i completely gone insane and I’m just a bad mom and wife? Help. ",
"I found out I was pregnant, and had a miscarriage that week. I was going to get an abortion, but it was still very traumatic to suddenly have the choice taken from me. 
This was about 5 weeks ago. I knew I was miscarrying because while passing some blood and tissue on the toilet, I started cramping horribly. I called for my bf and fainted in his arms shortly after. I was out for about 10 secs. I went to the hospital, where they confirmed I was miscarrying, gave me fluids, told me to take Advil and reach out to my obgyn.
My obgyn told me to take ibeprofen for pain while I passed all the tissue/miscarried at home. 2 weeks go by and I now have a follow up. my doctor saw me for an ultrasound to check everything had passed, and it hadn’t. I was scheduled for a D&C but had to wait a week to get an appointment due to the holidays. I finally have a D&C. 
It was really scary and anxiety inducing for me, because I don’t like needles and doctors already. Now it’s been a week, and I’m feeling less (but still quite a few random harsh) cramps, not bleeding too much at all, but still so tired/fatigued and achey. 

The worst thing though right now is my emotions. I feel so spun out of control. It’s like my highs are so high and my lows are so low that there’s no time for anything in the middle. I know it’s hormonal. I’m usually pretty able to deal with my anxiety and emotions very well. Right now I feel constantly on edge. What do I do about this?

 I feel all sorts of stress from missing work and not being able to do barely anything for the past few weeks. I feel kinda weirdly sad but not sad in terms of grieving the baby I was probably gonna abort. I have had 2 abortions before… this just feels emotionally different, maybe a bit heavier. My partner has been more supportive and patient than I’ve ever experienced support in my life, and still I can’t help but be upset even at him sometimes and it sucks. I don’t even really wanna work, or see any friends, I just wanna stay in my room and order Uber eats until I’m back to normal me (obviously I won’t do that I’m just saying what it feels like). Help? I can’t even sort out how to ask more specifically for what I need rn. ",

TW: child loss, drowning.

Sorry for the downer post but I would do anything to have skipped that part",
"Just as the title says, I don’t know what’s happening anymore. I’m 36 and a little over 6 months PP. I love my baby so much but I’m just so mentally exhausted. He’s not even a bad sleeper, so this is nothing about him and being a baby at all. This is all me and it’s something I just cannot control in my brain. It never shuts off. I’m in a constant state of anxiety and panic mode. I feel like I have no one to talk to even though I can probably reach out to my husband or any of my family members but it just feels like I can’t without blowing up and crying hysterically and then them getting either really angry for holding all of this back or really worried. I also don’t want to start any fights or drama. So I find myself in the bathroom at work crying a lot. I can’t concentrate for the life of me. When I get home I feel a little calmer but then I start having resentful thoughts and I get so mad at my husband. I don’t want to tell him that because I feel like it would just start an argument.  I feel like everything is just crushing me and all the responsibility of everything is on me. It feels like I’m drowning. Just needed to get all of this off my chest. Is this PPD? I feel like all of this really started the last few weeks because of the news that I got from work and also just all the stress of being in a really expensive apartment that we had to move to and daycare and just everything else.",

"So I’m an 18 year old mummy to my beautiful almost 6 month old twins.    I’ve been struggling silently for a long time and recently decided to tell my health visitor as it’s become a lot worse lately.     

I have a really bad fear of being sick which is why I’m always so scared to start new medication.    I was prescribed this a few weeks ago and decided that I want to wait to start it after Christmas.    

If this medication caused you dizziness or caused you to pass out. Please DO NOT TELL ME!!!     It is my worst fear to be dizzy and pass out. 

How was your experience with this medication?   How long did it take until you started feeling happier ?   Did it help with anxiety as well as depression ?   Did it make you throw up?   What side effects did you have and how long did they last ?  Is there anything I can do to make it easier for my self ?   

My main question is will I ever feel normal again ?  My anxiety started when I was 14 years old.   It came on so suddenly out of no where.   It was Halloween night 2021 and my ex boyfriend got extremely paralytic drunk.  He was throwing up blood and I thought he was going to die. It traumatised me.   Since that night I started having panic attacks daily and stopped going to school. I developed severe emetophobia ( fear of being sick ).    Things have never been the same since.   It always gets better in the summer.  I am able to leave my house a little more often than in winter and feel less shitty generally.   I dropped out of school and never went back. So I missed the last two years of high school which is a real shame because I was so smart and had really good grades.  I’d always dreamt of being a neonatal nurse.     I could leave my house by my self without giving it a second thought.  I could go into town with my friends and do whatever I want with no worries at all.     I have tried counselling in the past and i hated it. It didn’t do anything for my anxiety or depression.   My mum also paid a lot of money for me to have private hypnotherapy. And again that was a big waste of money and didn’t help me at all.   Will I ever be able to do that again ? Or will there always be some of that anxiety in the back of my mind. ? ",
"I just found out that in 1925, my great grandmother developed a severe case of PPD (wasn't called that then, but that's what it was.) Due to the lack of mental health resources at the time, she was committed to an asylum and died several months later due to ""loss of flesh"" (starvation, as she had lost the desire to eat.) My grandfather's only memory of his mother was of her being taken away, and being told that it was because she didn't love him and his brother enough. 

PPD has not gotten any easier in the last 100 years. It's still a mindfuck, it still makes you feel so isolated and alone, and there's still a stigma. But as I go through PPD/A again, and now have heard this story, I wanted to say how grateful I am to live during a time where there's therapy, medication, support groups, and above all a basic understanding and sense of compassion. I've never thought about the women who came before us, who laid the groundwork for the maternal mental healthcare we have today but in this moment I am eternally grateful that I can help manage my symptoms with modern medicine and therapy. 

Just wanted to share. Sending everyone here love and support as you try to get through another day. ",
"So I'm trying to navigate being 4 months postpartum and having to go back to work a month early. My gynecologist has been dismissive of everything. 

Childbirth was hard on me. It's my first child and my gynecologist was dismissive of all my worries. High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes run in my family her response was I'm fine I don't have anything to worry about. I was extremely dehydrated no matter how much I drank so my primary ran test and said I was pre-diabetic and to monitor my glucose because it was high. Feet were swelling bad on top of it. But she still insisted I was fine. He wasn't a big baby 8 lbs 11 oz. I was worried because both my sisters had huge babies and had to have c-sections. Again all I got told was oh doesn't mean I will. 

I had a natural birth but suffered tearing. Not sure if it's normal but she didn't tell me I had second degree tearing and had stitches. I was also running a fever due to covid during my labor so I wasn't able to have my support system outside of my husband. Who while I love, kept off to the side worried about being in the way. All I got told for my after care was don't wipe or use soap. Had to Google for how long and tiktok was basically how I knew what to look out for and what to do to help ease the pain. 

I spent my first two weeks in tears because of the pain and being unable to get to the baby or hold him. I'm still having pain 4 months later. My lower abdomen and hips are still hurting. Mainly getting up from sitting or off the bed can be extremely hard on me and hurts. Sometimes I have to hold the table or the wall. And now I'm back to work it's increased and someone else has to move the baby around for me at the end of the day. At my 8 week follow up she said i was healing fine and had extra scarring (???). And claimed the lower abdomen pain was my period coming back. Mind you yes I've had my period last month but the cramps were different than the pain I was feeling. My anxiety was also high once again and she did prescribe me a low dosage of my former medication.

Once again it was my primary who ran test and referred me to a different gynecologist at this point. I still haven't been able to speak with a therapist and won't for another 2 weeks. I'm told this could be PCOS, which I had and had to get on metformin to get pregnant, and or endometriosis. I had to go back to work due to my paid family leave running out and it barely covered my bills as is and had been putting my health insurance on my credit card.

My anxiety has increased even more. I'm starting to feel stressed from everything due to the gynecologist. I'm depressed from feeling like I'm drowning. My husband tries his best and we have my parents but I'm overwhelmed. Sometimes the baby crying triggers me but I don't want him to be away from me. I can't even go back on disability because I can't afford to keep putting my insurance on the credit card ($550 a month, me & baby). I did get medi-cal but have had 0 luck getting ahold of those doctors. Call goes straight to voicemail that literally only has the generic voicemail and doesn't even say it's a doctors office. No call backs so I don't even feel like I have that for a fall back.

I do see the gynecologist my primary recommended this week but it's stressing me even more. I'm worried I'll be told I should go back on disability due to my pains. It's visible on my face and in the way I walk. I also got recommended to a endocrinologist but his office is busy and has yet to return any of my calls and that online booking also says unable to.

I just feel like I have no help. No time to breathe. Especially now back to work. And I feel like a failure because I can't always hold my baby or soothe him when he's crying. I worry I'm going to drop him due to the issues. I'm bottling everything in because I know my husband tries and does a lot. I don't want him to feel bad. But I don't know what to do. I have no idea how to navigate this and motherhood. I'm just at work ready to cry due to feeling stressed and being away from the baby and being in pain.",
"I have a 3 month old and a toddler.My pregnancy had complications (preeclampsia). I have a very supportive wife (we are a two mom family). Her family is also super supportive. I have minimal family and no close friends. I have a history of depression and anxiety/take medication for the dual diagnosis. I can't figure out if I need to go on a second antidepressant or if how I'm feeling is just a result of not having my own support network, being isolated.

"4 weeks PP and im so done, i am so tired. the maximum amount of hours he spends at the house are 3 hours, not including sleeping. our place has become a fucking hotel for him. i get that he works and is tired but even at weekends he goes and spends the night at his family's place while im alone with the baby and my horrible thoughts. of course he asks if its okay if he goes and that if i say no he will stay but i dont want him to ask that to begin with especially since he has recently witnessed one of my breakdowns. he goes out with friends and family, practices his hobbies, eats out, and im just stuck with no one to talk to. I dont even have friends or family support and no one or anywhere to go to he has always been my number 1 support system and now i have nothing to fall back on. He asks me if im okay or if theres anything that annoys me but i say nothing i don't have the mental capacity to open up and this monstrous loneliness. I dont even want him to help me with the baby i just want someone around to talk to. even when he's home he just scrolls on his phone. 
what should i do to fix this? if i talk to him what should i say? i have no words nothing ",
"Sorry for the long post in advanced. Never in a million years did I think I would be posting this about having PPD but here I am. I’ve stopped breastfeeding almost a month ago and over the past few weeks have been overcome with anxiety, depression and paranoia. The smallest things trigger me and make my spiral with no end. As soon as I start to have a good few hours and feel like myself, something negative happens that sends me through my next rollercoaster of emotions. I get  postpartum rage like no other and try to ground myself with EFT tapping but the way I get angry over the smallest things is terrifying me. Not only that but paranoia started to creep in and I get crazy thoughts that I have this negative being watching me when I’m alone and intrusive thoughts set in. 

I’ve told my boyfriend and I know he wants to help but has no idea how. Sometimes he will have an attitude with me and I’ll snap and lose myself emotionally. He’s getting to the point where when I tell him how I’m feeling he just sits silent and lets me cry. I know it’s not his fault but I’m sure he’s exhausted from seeing me miserable all the time. I know it’s hard for him but I wish he could understand that I don’t even want to be with myself. 

I’ve reached out to my primary to try and get some answers on what to do next. I’m just lost right now and don’t know who I am and I want to be able to enjoy my life and be present for my 4 month old.

"Can anyone please help me understand my wife? We just had a baby 2 weeks back. I’m noticing very apparent changes in her mood. She is usually a fun loving person but nowadays even though I’m still able to make her laugh, I feel there is a constant sadness deep within her. I know breastfeeding has been hard on her because that is something she said explicitly. Her mood is especially bad in the morning, at times she cries just after waking up. I’ve tried to open her up and tell me the issue but she does not say anything. I’m 100% sure that something is wrong but I don’t what it is exactly or how to help her. I can take her to the doctor but without her willing to go I don’t know how to do that. 

One more thing that I’ve noticed but I maybe wrong as this is my observation is I feel a lack of bond with the baby. She gets irritated that the baby has to feed this much. This is first baby for both of us so I can’t really tell as an observer what is normal. But I definitely don’t see any joy in her while she is breastfeeding.

Another thing that she has mentioned is that I leave her alone. We have a lot of help at home so the workload is definitely not something that would bother her but me going to office or golf, could it be something that might bother her emotionally?

I know I’ve not given enough information but this is all I’ve. What should I do?

Edit: thanks for all your recommendations and support. I’ve tried to get actively get more involved and just be there for her and things are significantly getting better. You all gave me some perspective which I didn’t have earlier. 
Also, all of you who have commented about me playing golf. I was recently diagnosed as borderline hypertensive and doctor has asked me to mandatorily do some exercise every day so I go for about one hour and play golf because that’s the only non boring physical exercise for me. It’s not some 3 hours session with my buddies like you might be imagining. ",
"I just had a baby 5 months ago and I hate pregnancy, I hate how it feels. But since I've had the baby I've been longing to get pregnant again because there is just this feeling of emptiness inside me. Emptiness that I don't know how to fill other than physically filling it with something else. I don't know, I assume that's something missing in my life that I really desperately want but I have no idea what that is. Something is emotionally lacking.",
36 yo f 13 m pp. I'm so sick of this man's attitude and behavior i want a divorce. When did yall know it was hormones vs time to just call it a day,
"Hi all, I have never posted in a reddit group before but I feel like I need to talk to someone who actually gets what I’m feeling. I tried calling a hotline but the PPD specific one is closed for the day and am waiting for a call back from another. 
I am 6 months PP with my second child. Have an almost 3 year old. I have  very supportive and hands on husband. 
The last month or so I have been feeling depressed, mostly related to parenting. 
I get so over stimulated and overwhelmed by minor situations that wouldn’t have bothered me that much before. I feel like I can’t be alone with my kids because I might crumble. 
I cry a lot and feel like I want to scream and runaway. 
I was just making Christmas cookies with my eldest and he was just being a kid, making a mess, and I was so irritated and got to breaking point. 
I have intrusive thoughts and sometimes I just don’t want to be a parent anymore. I feel like I made a mistake. 
I don’t know anyone in my life that has experienced PPD (or they just weren’t open about it) so I don’t know who to talk to. 
My baby is exclusively nursed so I can’t catch a break. 
We all have Hand Foot and Mouth right now (joy) and can’t leave the house, which is exacerbating everything. My baby is so fussy because of this and her recent immunisations, which is abnormal for her. I’m not coping with it well. 

I am already on Sertraline for anxiety and have tried to increase my dosage but it just made the depressed feelings WAY worse. I’m going to a psychologist at the end of January. I feel like I’ve done everything I can to help myself but I guess I don’t know what else to do when a depressive episode hits me. 

Can someone tell me I’m not losing it, and I’m not alone, and I will feel better one day. Please.",
"My 12.5 year old Pomeranian  Eevee was diagnosed with late stage heart failure in May and was given 3-6 months maybe a year to live.  We were given meds to keep her comfortable and to maintain her daily life. I was suppose to be due in September and had major anxiety she wouldn’t make it to the birth. She was my light and comfort during my pregnancy journey. I know I was suppose to mentally prepare for the worst but every day she looked and acted like the happy little pup except for the terrible coughing fits she had all day and night. I prayed that she at least make it to the birth to meet her human brother and she did since he came a month early in August and she lived up until he was three months. I’m starting to have a lot of guilt, that maybe I didn’t give her enough care or attention during my pregnancy and afterwards cause I was tending to my son and that she felt neglected when I had to close the door on her at night cause her coughing would wake the baby up. Then I felt bad that maybe I should’ve waited to have a baby so that her last years would be full of my attention.  I start to think that maybe I could’ve taken better care of her health, done more for her quality of life. Then I also feel bad that I didn’t take enough photos of her and my son or even me and her. The day before she died she collapsed and I could tell she wasn’t right even when she got back up and was semi normal. I wanted to take her to vet but my son needed to feed and nap and by the time i finished the vet was closing and she didn’t seem bothered. I was gonna take her in the morning if she didn’t seem like herself again. I spent a little extra cuddle time with her before I had to put my son to bed and I don’t know why I said it but I told her if she was in pain and needed to go it would be okay and that I loved her.  ( I feel selfish for thinking maybe if I hadn’t said that she would be here still and maybe she took it as I didn’t want her to stay anymore.) I woke up at 5am dec 10th to change my sons diaper and she raised her head to look at us but didn’t follow like usual so when I was done I came back and noticed she was laying too still. All i remember was a blur and she died in my arms. I feel guilty that she waited for me to wake up and she wasn’t the first thing I held or that I left her in the room for a bit before holding her.  And now I can’t stop crying and feeling sad and I don’t want my son to feed of that I feel like a bad fur mom and a bad mom cause I just feel like I haven’t handled anything right and I can’t give my son my full attention without getting sad and seeing her during our normal day routine with him.  Like I didn’t have enough time to grieve her before I dropped her at the vet cause my son needed me. Everything felt rushed and like a dream. I’m just overwhelmed with emotions.  I just don’t know what to do anymore. My parents who originally didn’t want her but then feel in love are also sad but they keep telling me I have a son now and I need to put my grief aside for him. I know they mean well and they are very old school when it comes to emotion (Asian parents with very little emotions) but I just can’t seem to stop crying.  When does this get better. Has anyone else gone through this? 

Edit addition info- 

-I’m f 32( 10 year cancer remission was told I had very slim chance of having a baby) 

- traumatic birth baby came month early and was emergency C-section due to prolapsed cord was told that most babies die due to this. I was very lucky. 

-  I currently live at my parents home ( eevees home ) while my partner fixes his house and we work out some issues. ",
I haven’t felt like myself since giving birth three months ago. I’m in a really dark place and it doesn’t take much to trigger crying spells. I just want to cry all day. All my past traumas have returned and I feel as though the hormones are amplifying my grief / pain. I scheduled an appt with a therapist tomorrow. It’s ruining my relationship. I’ve told my partner I don’t feel like myself but I think he’s getting tired of my outbreaks. I’m feeling really helpless.  ,
"I’ve been having an extremely tough time ever since I gave birth, being a mother wasn’t that easy I always feel guilty that I’m not good enough as a mother as a wife, as a daughter or as an engineer. On top of the constant struggles with postpartum my dad passed away 2 months ago the month of my birthday. I was extremely close with my dad and needless to say I have been crying non stop every single day. Ever since I gave birth my relationship with my husband has gotten worse and he tells me that he no longer loves me and has threaten me with divorce and wants full custody of our daughter because he doesn’t want anything to do with me because of our communication issues he doesn’t believe that we would be able to coordinate coparentjng. I absolutely love my daughter she is breastfed and I hold her in my arms to sleep every night and diligently do contact naps everyday during my lunch breaks. I just feel extremely overwhelmed with every aspect of my life. Everything is crumbling. I miss my dad. Every time my husband and I have a disagreement I fear he will threaten me with divorce again and try to take away my daughter. For work I fear I will never be smart ever again because pregnancy brain is real and I feel stupid all the time. I’m miserable. ",
"I'm 25F and I'm not sure if anyone is in the same boat as me but I thought I'd vent. My fiance was deployed 3 months ago and comes back in 5 more months.

 I'm taking care of our 2 kids, a 6 month old and a 3 year old. I've recently been diagnosed with post partum depression and it's not been easy taking care of everything at home.

 My issue has been that I've been feeling jealousy and resentment towards my fiancee, especially when he tells me all the free time he has and that he goes out to have fun and drink with his fellow soldiers.

I don't blame him, I'm not expecting him to not make the best out of a situation that's not his fault, for some reason I just feel angry that I'm stuck here changing diapers and dealing with tantrums while he's got all the free time in the world (when he's not doing army work).

I'm not sure if anyone feels or has felt this way in my situation, I'm not even sure if it's even okay to feel this way about it, I'm just hoping he doesn't forget he has responsabilities when he comes back.",
I had a traumatic pregnancy and it was a miracle my baby girl made it. The pregnancy was about survival and I didn’t name her thinking when I saw her it would come to me but unfortunately it did not and my anxiety is shooting through the roof I don’t like any name and ones I did i somehow ruined them with associations. I loved Laila but a past coworkers with that name ruined it. Did anyone experience anything similar and does it get better ��,
"Ok. I know I have depression/anixety. I've had that my whole life. My youngest and LAST is 8 months and my other girls are 5, 10, and 18. I am so unhappy. I look at her and I'm disgusted with myself that I even got pregnant again. I love all of my girls but I'm literally so unhappy. All I want to do is cry. It's been like this for months and I hate myself for it.",
"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling a lot lately and wondering if what I’m experiencing might be postpartum depression.  

I have two young children—a 6-week-old newborn and a 1-year-old. Most days, I feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and filled with moments of uncontrollable anger, often directed at my husband.  

My relationship with my husband has been strained since my pregnancies and during this postpartum period. He does help, but his efforts often create more work for me. For example, if he feeds the baby, he might lose the bottle lid, leaving me to search for it later when washing bottles. He doesn’t take initiative and rarely does things without me asking, which really irritates me.  

Stressful moments are the worst. If the baby has a blowout, I’m left frantically cleaning her up and looking for clothes while she’s crying, and he just sits there—either ignoring me or watching. The crying overwhelms me to the point where I start shouting, and his response is to go silent, which triggers me even more. We’ve talked about his inaction in these situations, but it feels like we’re going in circles.  

He recently told me he tries to leave the room or spend time alone because my shouting makes him feel triggered. This, however, only makes me feel more abandoned. I desperately want us to spend time together—not just for me, but for our kids.  

Arguments follow a predictable cycle. I say horrible things out of frustration, and he goes quiet. After a few hours or the next day, he starts acting like nothing happened, which makes me feel dismissed. It’s as though my feelings don’t matter. I feel invisible, as though my emotions and efforts don’t matter, and I’m constantly battling loneliness and frustration

I love my kids deeply, but I feel so disconnected from myself. All I seem to do every day is shout at my husband, say hurtful things, and cry afterward out of guilt and loneliness. 

Another thing I've noticed is that sometimes when my toddler won't stop crying I get sudden burst of anger and I shout 'stop crying' and I feel insanely overwhelmed.
Then I feel guilty and sad for shouting because he's just a baby, I feel like a terrible mother.

I’ve thought about reaching out to a GP or health visitor, but I’m terrified they’ll judge me as a mother or, worse, think I’m unfit and take my children away. As I'm writing this right now I'm sitting here crying because I feel like I'm failing as a mother and my children deserve better.

Could this be postpartum depression? Is postpartum rage part of it? If anyone has experienced this, I’d be so grateful for your insights or advice.
 
I have a health visitor visiting today so I'm wondering should I say anything? If so, what? I don't want her to think I'm an unfit mother and take my children away (that's my biggest fear) but I also want to know if this is normal and if there's help I can get. Btw I'm from the UK.

Thank you for reading and helping me figure this out.  ",
"I had my baby three weeks ago tomorrow. I’ve been an emotional wreck since then, officially diagnosed with PPD. I’ve worked with a doula, have my regular therapist, psychiatrist, a peer counselor, and am attending postpartum groups for moms. But despite that, tonight is just a bad night and I’m seriously wishing I could give my baby up for adoption. I don’t want to do this anymore. Idk if this is just the depression talking and if it gets better and if I’ll start to adore my baby and love motherhood as she gets older and less needy. Can someone convince me this gets better and adoption isn’t really what I want? ",
"A friend of my partner came over to visit my son. He was educating me about a lot of things. Saying I was doing some things incorrectly. To me, I do not think it's incorrect but maybe we just have different beliefs and different parenting techniques. He is a father of three to three different women.

For context, I do not like the guy. Because he has been tolerating my partner's cheating habits. Yeah, I got that bro code thingy but is it greater than values?

Well yeah, I just felt like if he had comments, it was better to tell it to my partner since they are the ones with relationship, not me.",
"Seriously how. 3 months out and I feel like I’m falling apart. I don’t know what to do or how to fix myself anymore. It feels like I’m just out in the middle of the ocean drowning. The world is so dull and grey to me. I have brief moments of joy and confidence like I can do this and it’ll all work out then it just gets completely shattered in a matter of seconds. I’ve lived with PTSD for over a decade and I’ve always been able to pull myself out of whatever hole I was in. This is unlike anything I’ve ever felt, and it’s deeper and more dark. I’ve increased my meds, I’ve talked to a therapist, I’ve reached out to loved ones and told them where I’m at. I’ve taken breaks and I’ve cried my body weight in tears. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Please share advice, suggestions, anything. I want to see my little boy grow up so badly. I want him to have a great mom and a mom that’s alive to see what life he lives. ",
"Hey, my wife and I just had our second baby. We have three kids (I have one from a previous marriage.) One moment we’re happy and she’s fine and the next moment she’s pissed at me. She tells me I’m a good dad and I help with the kids, then the next moment she says I’m a child and I’m selfish and hard to deal with. We have ZERO romantic relationship. I try to make an effort but she doesn’t care at all. Today I was late picking up one of the kids from my parents, I was gone 1 hour. It takes 20 minutes to get there and back. I talked to my mom for 20 minutes. She freaks out, turns it into a huge argument. I mainly watch the older two while she watches the baby. I feed and change the baby, but it’s hard for me to help at night cause she’s breastfeeding. I feel super under appreciated, I cook almost every meal, I clean, I watch the kids, I take the oldest to school, I work nightshift. I make an active effort to consider her and get her things. One minute she loves me and the next moment she hates me. Tonight she said she wants to “give up.” I told her she needs to go to the doctor and get put on medication/therapy. It’s ruining our marriage. It’s like if one thing doesn’t go as planned in her head she goes off. I do have my faults, I can’t be 100% all of the time, there are times where I’m exhausted too. I make crude jokes but I always have since we were together it’s just how I am and I don’t really mean anything by it.  Our second child is a hard child, he’s into everything, constantly throwing tantrums ( 1.5 yo M). It’s almost impossible to be around her, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, I just wait for her to explode. She blames me for everything. I don’t feel like she loves me at all, she says we don’t have a relationship. I can tell she is disgusted by me, she hardly ever touches me. I do whatever she wants, scratch her head or back, get her whatever she ask. I feel like I just serve her and the kids. I don’t feel loved at all by her. My life revolves around how she feels, and if she feels bad she takes it out on everyone around her. Her family has told me that she’s been that way since she was a kid. I can’t tell if I’m the asshole or if she’s gaslighting me any time we argue. Help please our marriage is falling apart. ",
"10 months post partum and got my period yesterday. Still breastfeeding while the baby is on solids since 6 months old. He eats nearly 3-4 times a day since the last two months. Nothing changed in the feeding cycle but here we are. 
And all the symptoms of PMDD. 
I am well managed cPTSD and on venlafaxine during pregnancy. Since i was wt a high risk of post partum depression, I increased the dosage which worked quite well. Not for PMDD though. 
Needless to day my fibromyalgia is at the lowest point since the week after birth. No amount of pain relief works. How am I supposed to look after my child! Just a rant. Baby is the least bothersome boy but he still needs the attention. Before the baby, I would stay in bed for at-least two days/",
"Hi! I’m 2 weeks postpartum and I really love my son. It’s just that I haven’t really slept much since I gave birth via emergency CS (due to abruptio placentae) like only 4hrs per day (divided into 2 cycles of baby’s sleep). I only eat once a day. It’s basically just me because my husband needs to work. 

I usually find myself crying like 3-4x/day, but my husband said I should just get a grip and I’m being an irresponsible and toxic mom. I ended up slapping him when he said that. He then pushed me to the ground. I felt so guilty and now I’m crying again but I feel like I don’t love him anymore and I want to get a divorce. What should I do?",

"My friend is going through PPD and struggling to be a ""good friend."" What I mean is she removed herself from a group chat of friends that really care for her, says she is too overwhelmed to see anyone, and won't ask anyone about what's going on in their lives.

I have read through many of the PPD posts to try and gain an understanding of how I can support her but as a childless female, I won't be able to fully grasp what she's going through. With this, I understand I need to give her grace and check in to make sure she is good. I am making sure we see eachother whether it is for a walk or I bring over takeout. 

While I am still reaching out to her and making an effort to see her, 2 other friends are ""over it."" One friend is pregnant and the other is childless. Both have their own things that they are going through. However, they have also made an effort to talk and hang out with our friend. But as I said, the friend has distanced herself from us and will post cries for help on social media. They have just hit a point where they want to protect their own peace and not reach out to our friend dealing with PPD currently.

Should I continue to be a supportive friend or should I try and talk to her about her actions and how they are impacting her friends? What can i tell the other 2 so they can maybe understand the situation? I feel very stuck in the middle. I understand that the 2 women want to protect their peace but our other friend is going through a lot. I don't know how to get everyone on the same page. ",
Why is it so hard to get my partner to support me going through postpartum. He’s so focused on him not getting his sexual needs met that he doesn’t care about me spiraling by the day. He told me today that he plans to move out. Our baby is 5 months old. I don’t know what I have to do get him to understand his support is lacking severely.,
I’m struggling daily with postpartum and I’m at my dead end and I’m searching for free support options. ,
"Idk about anybody else, but winter time has got to be the worst time to be post partum. It's gloomy every day, I'm at home with the baby by myself. It's too cold to take her out, I'm getting lonely and cooped up and at times baby is getting on my nerves and I have nobody to relieve me for a moment �

Anybody have any advice on how to keep myself occupied and some form of normalcy in these times? ",
"My depression started in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. Suddenly I felt empty and unable to be happy or excited about anything. I have my baby now, and she is perfect. Hardly cries, healthy, adorable. Lots of support at home. I have everything I ever wanted, but I don’t understand why I can’t be happy about it? I feel like my husband is frustrated and doesn’t understand, but honestly I don’t understand either. When I try to think of positive thoughts, they are replaced with negative ones that I can’t control. Why does this happen? Does it ever get better?",

"I’m 5 weeks pp today and I had my baby at 33 weeks and 3 days due to sudden severe preeclampsia and preterm labor. I ended up having a C-section. My boyfriend of 2 years has suddenly decided he is not sure if he wants to be with me anymore now. His reason is because I haven’t been cleaning and apparently I have never cleaned enough. Back story is, he moved in in April when I found out I was pregnant because he was going to be on house arrest due to a DUI and I became a SAHM in August when I quit my job to help take care of him after a motorcycle accident ( he is all healed now). I feel very blindsided by this but the PPD is kinda helping with the numbness I guess so I’m just like slowly processing it and I’m not overly upset. He has an alcohol problem that is suddenly becoming a problem again and I made him aware of the a couple days ago which obviously upset him and he denied it being an issue. He never offered to help me clean the house and I ended up asking my mother to come help me by sitting with my other kids and the baby so that I could clean because he left to go stay with his dad tonight and tomorrow I guess. 

I spent almost 3 weeks everyday at the NICU breastfeeding my son I was there from 7am-7pm every day. Ultimately the only reason he got to come home was because I stayed at the NICU for 48 hours straight breastfeeding because he didn’t do well with a bottle at all and the feeding was the only thing that determined how long he stayed. He’s only been home for 2 weeks now and I haven’t slept much so I sleep in fairly late after I take my other kids to school and try to make it a point to get up and clean something every day when I do get up. He’s had multiple days off work due to cold weather and spends his time drinking in the garage. Never offers to help and frankly I don’t want him to hold my newborn while he’s drunk anyways. He held him the other day for an hour (when he was sober) while I did some dishes and stuff and then mentioned his arm hurting and he can’t just sit in one position for that long. So I didn’t get much done. I’m just like confused how suddenly he doesn’t want to be with me because of a mess, but doesn’t want to help and was just saying how lucky he was to have me just a couple weeks ago. When I mentioned him helping he said “I didn’t make the mess and I pay the bills you don’t”. I didn’t realize I guess when I took on the roll of a SAHM I was going to be doing it completely by myself with no help at all. I also didn’t realize that months later he would decide to leave me where I have no job and 2 kids and a baby to be responsible for. I just don’t even know what to say or how to even feel. Part of me just wants to say “don’t even think about it just get your stuff and get out” ",
"so here’s a bit of context. i’m 18, a FTM. found out i was pregnant a month before i turned 18 and now have a beautiful four month old baby boy. I feel like i’m losing my mind. sleep is all over the place. the only time i feel sorta sane is when my boyfriend is at home. he works full time and works late at night sometimes. everytime my baby cries, i just feel this huge overwhelming sense over my shoulders and chest. i am 18 still trying to figure my life out on top of my baby. i love him and i want to be better for him. the house is a mess. i get overstimulated easily. i just want one day where i can wake up, get myself ready, do my own things, and get my baby back later. i want to feel like myself for one day again. i’ve completely lost who i am. i do love my baby and we do have amazing days and bad days. i just want to make him the happiest and i don’t want to just breakdown when he wakes up to eat anymore. i want to ENJOY taking care of him. i’ve always wanted to be a mom as long as i can remember. i do have plans to go back on medication. people are always wanting to see the baby and my boyfriend and i are exhausted. after work, he will take the baby so i can do a bit of my own thing but that isn’t until later in the day. i don’t know what it going on. i have my own time. not for long but i do. there’s only a few babysitters we trust because he’s a very specific baby. my fuse is getting shorter and shorter by the day. i want to enjoy being a mom i really do. i don’t know what to do.

"If you are in the midst of active PPD, please scroll on by because my intention is to not worry Moms more than this condition already does! Most women recover, and I want to make that clear.

However, if you are a Mom that is years out from diagnosis of severe PPD, I want to know how you are doing. 

My daughter just turned 5. I went inpatient at 10 weeks. I had a treatment that really helped me for a couple years to manage with medication and therapy. But it has never been available to me again as I was no longer postpartum. At some point they just give up and decide to change your diagnosis to MDD/TRD. I ended up inpatient again two years ago. I feel I am headed in that direction once more, but won't admit myself into a unit again. Nothing seems to help. Something happened in the midst of childbirth that had altered my brain, and I just really, really wish there were answers. My daughter still deserves her Mom, I think. But that message is lost the longer you continue to be symptomatic. So how many women don't actually recover and just stop talking about because we are ""supposed to be better already""?",
"2 months postpartum my husband went back to work about 2 weeks ago… I stayed with my mom for a short awhile and the time at my mom was great I got sleep I felt like I wasn’t going insane. I’m also bipolar I’ve told my husband my worries and all I get greeted with, “don’t let that run your life…” so helpful… and I also get greeted with, “I’m currently working 12 hours shifts 5 days straight I would switch positions with you in a heartbeat.” I haven’t slept since coming back from my mom’s which was last week when my husband started his 12 hour shifts… (looks like it’ll be a month of 12 hour shifts 5 days a week) I haven’t been taking my meds on a regular cause my meds make me super tired and it’s almost impossible to wake up (and with a baby needing to eat every 2-4 hours…) 
I feel like my husband doesn’t get the severity of PPD or PPA mix that with bipolar I feel like I’m going insane… I tell him I’m scared of hurting myself, I told him I want to bang my head against the wall so I can get sleep… and I get greeted with, “well I work I can’t just not get sleep…” which I get but not having this all land on me would be nice… as well as not only having the weekend to take my meds and get sleep… he makes how I feel about him rather than hearing me out.

"Hi! I’ve been lurking similar themed posts and I guess I’m not finding the answers I want. I have a gorgeous 7 month old daughter but I’m struggling. I have post natal depression and it seems to be coming in waves. I have some good periods where I feel like I’m doing well. I get out and go to classes with her and enjoy being a mum. But sickness seems to trigger low mood. I feel paralysed and struggle to do basic tasks like get out of bed, make myself lunch etc. I look after my daughter but I find myself cuddling her a lot on the lounge and having her contact nap on me. I find it hard to do much more than that and I feel like the worst mum in the world. I feel lazy and like she deserves more. I’m taking medication, have a wonderfully supportive husband, good support networks around me and I see a psychologist. When I’m in these low moods I feel like it’ll never end and that nothing will help. Everything overwhelms me and it all feels too hard. Sorry for the long post. If you made it this far thank you. 

Edited- spelling ",
6weeks pp. How do you stop yourself from losing it when you’re in the thick of sleep deprivation following a particularly bad night? Once I’ve managed to get some sleep I’m horrified at how  I’ve acted towards my husband and toddler. How can I control my rage better when I’m not feeling like myself? I don’t want to be so out of control. ,
"So all the depression symptoms and suicide ideation I’ve had my daughter (13) is having. We are at the ER for a mental health evaluation for her. I feel like I could be in the same place. I’m so scared and my husband is at work. I wish he would come home early. 

All I can think about is “if I was a better mom: to make the kids mind, not be so loud and crazy, if the house was more organized, if we had more routines,” 
Then this wouldn’t be happening to my daughter. 
As much as I want her to live, I want to disappear. How is this even fair? ",
"My daughter is 4 months old, and I feel like an absolute disaster. Before she was born, I was fiercely independent and a workaholic. My husband and I have been working together for the past seven years.

My pregnancy was unintentional, but it went smoothly. We live with my widowed MIL, who has always been difficult. She says the most hurtful and insensitive things, but I used to manage by retreating to my room for personal space. Even after all these years, I’ve never felt like this house is mine. I tiptoe around her—not because I fear her, but because I dread her comments that hurt me deeply.

She doesn’t let me cook and babies my husband like he’s a child. She constantly tries to prove she’s closer to him than I am, saying things like, “He held my hand when we went to [so-and-so place].” My husband never sees a problem with her behavior and always asks me to tolerate her because she’s a widow.

Everything changed after I became a mother.

When my daughter was born, my MIL became possessive to an extreme. At the hospital, she didn’t let my mother hold the baby. She took over feeding her formula and cleaning her, even though I was breastfeeding. Later, she told my SIL in front of everyone, “She already had the best time with her daughter while feeding her for two days.” It broke me—why does she feel the need to take over and act like she’s the mother?

At home, her constant advice and interference completely drain me. She calls my daughter her child and keeps emphasizing that the baby looks like my husband or my SIL. It’s like she’s trying to erase me.

She even told me, “Your daughter loves you now because you’re feeding her. Later, you won’t need to worry because I’ll cook for her, and she’ll forget you.” I want to cook for my daughter—I need to. But she controls the kitchen and creates a scene whenever I cook. Still, I’ve started asserting myself and cooking anyway.

I took a therapy session where the therapist suggested I should appreciate the help. But why can’t I have the freedom to raise my daughter the way I want? Why can’t I decide what’s best for her? I’m constantly anxious about the future—what if my MIL starts dominating me even more when it comes to feeding or other decisions?

I hate conflict, but I have to face her every day. She’s intruding on my life, and I feel like I’m suffocating. Every day feels heavier than the last. I wake up gripped by dread and anxiety.

I’ve also become very possessive of my daughter. I hate it when others, especially my MIL, spend time with her. I fear that my daughter won’t recognise me as her mother or won’t care about me. I know some of these thoughts are irrational, but I can’t help it.

I come from a small family and am extremely close to my parents. I don’t have many friends, so this situation feels even more isolating.

I don’t know what to do. How do I handle all of this? How can I make myself feel better?",
"Need to vent but also need advice. 

I’m sorry but life was so great before getting unexpectedly pregnant. I thought it was what I wanted, but the poor decisions I made while being pregnant and post partum have ruined everything. 

I got pregnant, then spontaneously bought a house 9 months pregnant. I then had the baby. I then worked through my maternity leave from home because I was too concerned about losing money, it’s just not fair to have to go without pay for three months after suffering through the trauma of having a child. 

Then, my husband and I freaked out about the mortgage payment, so we stupidly listened to our shitty realtor and moved out of our BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION BEAUTIFUL HOME to move back in (in a way shittier climate mind you- I used to live in Vegas) back to my mothers hoarder house in NY because we also missed family and I can’t handle the baby. 

NOW, my house isn’t selling, I am wasting $3k a month on a mortgage. I left the best and easiest six figure position I had back in Vegas which I now can’t get back. The closest offer I can get is a massive paycut to where I’ll be eating into my savings each month to get by. 

I’m now stuck and probably going to have to take a loss just to get out from under the house. I’m now stuck on the east coast in this miserable shit hole in miserable weather. I could go back to Vegas but for a fucking price as I’m going to be working harder than ever for less money, lonely (I do love my family and the company) and on my own taking care of this baby while my husband will probably go work another shit job on an opposite schedule because it’s that or spend a fucking fortune on child care. 

I’m miserable in NY, I was miserable in Vegas but realized the west coast and weather there was so much nicer- but also can’t stand the loneliness. And now the fact that I will be busting ass to barely make it by. Or, stay in NY like a fucking loser living with my mother with the three of us cramped in a tiny bedroom. I can either quit my job once the house sells and rot away doing nothing because there is nothing to do in NY in this shit weather/nothing to do period honestly, I’m a nature lover and there’s none of that living right outside NYC. Or, I can stay at my job that I took coming here where I make money but deal with a dangerous and lengthy commute every fucking day (I’m talking 3-4 hours of travel every day) and the best part? When I get there there is nowhere to park. 

I have the option to either take the low offer, get my house and the beautiful west coast, but be miserable in the low offer job and struggling financially, struggling with loneliness and raising a kid by myself, or, sell the house likely at a loss (not willing to rent as that is also going to be a loss that I’m perpetually stuck with), and live in my moms shitty house in shitty weather in the shitty state of NY, but at least there’s some family around to keep company. 

What do I do now? I ruined my life. I feel like I am never going to be happy again. I enjoy nothing. My life is such a mess now (I can’t even unpack my things because of how cluttered the house is) we don’t even do milestone pictures (I can’t find anything), I don’t even remember to take them. He doesn’t have the space to play like he did at our other house but has family in his life now. But he screams because all he wants to do is explore and I have t gotten the chance to clean the mess and child proof the house. 

I am MISERABLE. 

Please advise on what you would do if you were in this situation. I don’t know what to do. ",
"Hi, 

I’m 11 weeks post partum and while I absolutely love my son I still feel like someone just died.
More specifically me, or a part of me. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Every waking minute I spend worrying and thinking about my son. But all I really want most of the time is to run away and be free of all the responsibility. I keep feeling like he’d be better off without a mom who feels this way. I keep wanting to just go through the day without planning his bottles, his diaper changes, his tummy time, hearing him scream, sleep training. I just want to be me again. 
The only thing I do lately that remotely feels like me is go for a run 2-3 times a week. I put my headphones in and blast really loud techno and just run anywhere. It makes me feel for a moment I could actually leave. I never do. But it’s become such an obsession that I overdo it. I almost go every day. I’m scared because last time I obsessed about something like this I got an eating disorder. 
I also can’t sleep at all, the only thought that puts me to sleep is ending it all. Like literally thinking about it until I fall asleep. The weird thing is I don’t even have any plan to do it at all or even want to. It just feels like I am getting through the days and they all feel the same. I can’t even see a future further than a week from now. How am I supposed to do this parent thing for the next years????",
"I just don’t understand. For two days straight, this baby has been up all night. At no point did she sleep during this time, so two nights in a row there has been no sleep for me or her AT ALL. I don’t mean that she’s up for a feeding and then sleeps for an hour. I mean up the entire time eating and wanting to be held. I don’t know what’s going on or how to get through this. No, she isn’t sick. She hasn’t pooped in a few days, but the doctor said this is normal for breastfed babies. This is driving me completely insane because supposedly this isn’t even supposed to happen and newborns aren’t capable of staying up this long? I’m 5 weeks postpartum punching walls. ",
Why do I bother trying to go back to sleep? I rarely do. Its been months. I don't know how long I can keep going on 3 to 4 hours of sleep. Waking up every hour on the hour then not being able to go back to sleep. I've been up since 1130pm. It's just about 5am. I have work at 8am. I'm primary parent. I have house work and grocery shopping. We have no help and I wish I'd died during my c-section. I thought I was doing better but I was oh so wrong. I'm worse. All I feel is exhaustion and rage. I started hitting and biting myself to try and regulate. To feel anything else. I don't meet with my therapist until next week and I CAN'T FUCKING SLEEP.,
"I’m on the meds. I’ve talked to the therapist. She mentioned short-term disability but my family can’t afford the loss of income. 

I think it would be better if I called it quits while my daughter is still young. It’ll be easier on her.

Edit: I don’t know how to respond to all of the kindness poured out here, so I’ll say this:

I have not seen this level of understanding and validation in my real life, so it means so much to me that I’m not the only one and there really are survivors out there. 

Thank you for sparing me that extra “fight” in you. I didn’t have my own, but I’m thankful to hold on to yours words and help me keep pushing.",
"I’m 6 months post partum and I thought I was getting better but everyday feels the same or worse than before. I think of ending my life everyday but I don’t do it becuase I look at my son and know it would crush him. But it’s so hard waking up everyday just not wanting to be alive. I work full time now from home and I feel like I’m doing 2 full time jobs at once even though we do have a nanny. I pump almost every hour, need to wash the pumps each time, I don’t eat because on my lunch breaks I take my son and hang with him while our nanny goes on lunch. I feel like I never have a moment to myself. I’m just tired. I’m so so tired of living every single day. I’m just hopeless at this point. ",
"Ftm, 23yr
I'm 4 months postpartum with a wonderful boy. I have an adoring husband. But I feel undeserving, overwhelmed. I already have ppd and ppa on top of my normal depression and anxiety and ptsd. It seems like everything i do is wrong. My best friend thinks that I'm disrespectful and not treating her right, when I told her the truth on how I felt on her attitude. I'm apparently in the wrong because I've been ""mean"" since getting pregnant. I don't want to hurt my son. I'd rather hurt myself. I feel like people are starting to resent me. I couldn't breastfeed, I tried to exclusively pump instead I couldn't keep up.. had to switch to formula.. i know fed is best but I resent myself and my abilities as a mother,  a friend, a wife. 
Idk if it's trauma related (my mother abused me until I cut her out) I'm on Prozac now but idk what's all wrong with me. I seem to have more bad days than good
I'm sorry for the long post... ",
"Hello Everyone

I have a horrible history of how I have been having my pregnancy. If you want the tea go thru my posts. 

I am 32 weeks and the mood swings are INSANE, yesterday i had a different emotion every hour and at night it switched to every 30 min. Im already on antidepressants, anxiolytics, and on prenatal depression high risk for PPD stated by my doctor. 

The thing is I share my mood swings with friend and they say they never had it “that bad” “ poor me” etc. I hate to admit yesterday I had a knife to open a box and a thought of hmm imagine if I stabbed my husband with it and caught myself. Also I experience crazy intense moods especially anger, sadness, and happiness. All in one day, has anyone had this dueing pregnancy as well? ",
"I feel like I don’t deserve any form of disability leave because I’m not in a mandatory hold right now. I’m comfortable in my own bed and not chained to a hospital bed. 

I’m actively seeking help from professionals, however I reached a breaking point this past weekend and applied for a short-term disability leave for my postpartum depression. 

I’m taking all the right meds and talking to all the right doctors, so I should be able to deal, right? I should be able to put my big girl panties on and just go to work. 

I feel like an imposter or like I’m “taking advantage of the system” because I didn’t actually act on any of my ideations. At this point I’m more afraid of having to live through a failed attempt than no longer existing. ",
"Sometimes I feel so angry and get scared I might hit my baby. I am born in a family where hitting children is very normal and it just seems to come naturally to me. But I don’t want to do that and want to break that cycle. 
So many times I feel on the verge on hitting her even THOUGH I know it’s not her fault. She herself is struggling with eating and sleeping.

 She is 9mo but doesn’t eat even a single solid meal properly. Just 3-4 bites. 
She gets up every 2 hrs during the night asking for feed and also she gets gassy very fast, so if she likes something and she eats more of it then she’ll have hard time sleeping in the night and will keep getting up crying � 

It gets really tiring and irritating sometimes like I don’t know what to do.. I feel so angry but I don’t know who to blame .. nothing on the net works

My husband is of no help",
"Almost 8 months PP. I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel like a bad mother. I don't know if I'm doing it all right :( we're always in the house, I can't drive and the neighborhood is crazy for crimes lately. We can only go out when my husband is off work. I love my life being a mom but at the same time i feel like I'm not doing it right. I feel like I'm getting close to losing it",
"Hey all. I’m about 16 months PP, and I have really hit a slump. It feels like nobody really checks in or cares anymore. My sibling is having another kid so my family is invested in the new baby and I just don’t have a lot of mom friends, especially working mom friends so it’s hard for me to get together with anyone. My baby has also been hitting milestones a little later than my friends kids too, so I just feel like I’m failing him too. Idk what I’m hoping to get out of this post, but has anyone experienced a bad bout of PPD this late in the game? I feel ridiculous even calling it that because I’m so far removed from the newborn days, and everyone seems to think I’m just back to my old self again, and I just feel far from it.

ETA: I am in therapy, on meds, and have an incredibly supportive partner.",
"I am 5 months PP with my 2nd baby and everyday I feel my fuse getting shorter and shorter. I become very short with my toddler, baby, and husband. I am so touched out and stressed out. I keep grinding my teeth which has led to jaw pain. I saw a therapist once only to realize it was $30 a session (which we really don’t have right now). It’s the holiday season but I am filled with anger and stress. I am on medication (100 mg of Zoloft) but I feel like it isn’t making a dent. Currently breastfeeding but will be done soon as I go to student teach full time in January. I feel so guilty because I am a current SAHM and know I should be embracing the short time I have left with my kids. WHAT HELPS?!?! ",
"I am 6 weeks postpartum and struggling severely with panic attacks. Doc says its from hormone imbalance, which makes sense. This is my first baby so this is the first time I am ever experiencing something like this. I’ve never really had extreme panic attacks like this until 2 weeks ago. They have literally been waking me up out of my sleep.
I was prescribed 50 mg Zoloft in hopes that it would start to soften the blow. No luck so far. Granted its only been 2 weeks. 
A couple days ago I had a panic attack so severe it landed me in the hospital. There I was prescribed .5 mg lorazepam which was my saving grace. I ran out of the last pill a couple days ago. 
I haven’t been able to make an appointment with my ob so I went to an urgent care yesterday. They prescribed me 25 mg hydroxyzine and my god has it made me feel fucking terrible. I literally feel like a zombie right now. Ive also been continuously having panic attacks the past 4 hours. 

I’m hoping once I can land an appointment later today with my ob that I can get some more lorazepam. In the meantime, I am left with just my racing thoughts, impending doom, and extreme drowsiness. 

I don’t know exactly what i’m looking for here. Maybe some hope things will get better? I feel like I am at the lowest point of my life and it’s getting increasingly difficult to find relief. This is the first time in my life I have struggled this bad mentally. I feel so alone. ",

A bit of background, I was constantly stressed during my postpartum on whether I was being a good mother and wanted to follow wake windows. This caused me super depressed and stressed all the time. Now I am better. 

Well now, My friend, FTM, she is expecting and is currently at around 8 months. So I told my friend that it is not all fun and exciting because I always had the feeling that I would have prepared myself if someone has said this to me. But her response hurt me a lot. 

She said her close friend did not have the depression and managed it well and depends on people. She says it really is how well you could have managed it. She also said to stop bringing negativity to her and she will ask if she needs counselling. I was hurt when I tried to make her ready for what’s coming and all I got in return is that I did not manage it well. 

Now, I feel I am overreacting and constantly asking myself whether I was showing my weak self towards my baby. I am questioning myself “Did I not manage it well? Am I doing something wrong in telling people the actual reality?” I think this lingering feeling will never go away now. 

Edit: Reading all your comments has been incredibly reassuring. It reminds me that I’m not alone in this postpartum journey, and it’s comforting to know that the challenges I’m facing are shared by others. It makes me happy to realize that I’ve been doing my best, and there’s nothing I could have done differently to change the situation. 

I also realize now that I shouldn’t have initiated the conversation with my friend until she was ready to approach me herself. I didn’t consider how overwhelming or scary it might have been for her from her perspective. Thank you for helping me see things more clearly.",
Maybe I am overreacting but he keeps doing it. Hanging out with someone without telling me even if I know who he hangs out with. Idk if I’m overreacting about it. But I’d honestly like for him to let me know. Especially now while I’m dealing with postpartum ,
My mood is so affected by my ability to sleep. Which was ok after the first few weeks bc my baby was only waking 1-2 times per night. Now he is definitely going through a sleep regression. He is 15 weeks. Hard to put down to sleep. Waking every 1-2 hrs overnight. I’m exhausted and it’s only been a week. I have a supportive amazing partner who is also exhausted and who I’m afraid to lean on any more bc he needs time to rest and reset too (he is our rock and I don’t know what I’d do without him). I cry so much during the day. We hired a nanny to come in for 9 hours per week to help out. I feel like such a failure everyone I know did this without hiring help. We have no family near by and no close friends to really lean on. I don’t know what to do and I’m so worried that I’ll feel like this forever. I really was feeling okay/coping better when the baby’s sleep was better. I have a stash of old sertraline I’m thinking about starting again. I don’t know why I’m posting here I just needed to put this out there I guess. ,
"“If you need anything reach out!” 

hey I need something. 

hey I’m really struggling. 

“Aww mama you’re so strong!!”

No, I’m really not doing well. 

“You got this mama!!!❤️”

No I don’t. Help 

“You’re doing such a great job!!”

Im not doing great I am about to lose it. Please. Help. Me. 

“How’s the baby doing �”

Baby’s great, I, am suffocating. 



And then it unfortunately sometimes turns into 

“I wish there was something we could’ve done I had no idea she was struggling”.  
",
"I’ve struggled with anxiety/depression/PMDD since I was a teenager, I’m in my 30s and 4 months post partum with my first baby. Everything has been difficult and overwhelming, but I thought I was getting through between seen a specialist doctor and my therapist. I knew the hormones were to blame in the beginning. I’m on the highest dose of Zoloft that is allowed (was on it prior to pregnancy, increased it in 3rd trimester and again a month ago). 
I think I’m actually getting worse. Caring for the baby is getting objectively easier, but I am so fucking low. I can’t stop thinking about how she doesn’t like me, how I’ve made a horrible mistake, and regret having her. I know that I did love her before, I know I felt joy and overwhelming love. It’s gone though. I don’t feel anything when I’m with her. It doesn’t feel like she came out of my body at all. We are supposed to have this bond and she seems honestly happier with other people. She is incredibly fussy for me to get her to nap, which makes me have thoughts of hurting her (I haven’t and I won’t). But for others she falls asleep easily. This is a huge trigger right now. I’m going to talk to the doctor this week and tell them something needs to change. I can’t keep living like this. Sometimes I can’t even look at her or hold her because I’m so upset. ",
"She’s not technically mine. I came into her life when she was a toddler just three years ago. Her mom isn’t in the picture, really. I took on the maternal role by choice. Everything was fine until my third trimester. She started becoming difficult in her behavior and the way she’d speak to me and that’s when DH started expecting more out of me, except I was exhausted from all the swelling I had and being physically uncomfortable all the time.

I’m 9 weeks pp and I’m having the hardest time getting her ready for school without her screaming at me while I tend to a hungry, screaming baby. And then picking her up from school is a struggle because it’s when baby needs his nap but he gets so overtired and cries and screams in the pick up lane and all I can do is cry with him. There have been many times where after I pick her up I have to pull into the parking lot to tend to my baby for about 30 minutes. I tried talking to DH about having her ride the bus in the afternoon as it would help me tremendously. He said no. 

Also the only other way I’m able to keep her from fighting with me is to let her watch tv or play her game. But when I tell her it’s time to stop, the screaming starts back up. But when I talk to DH about it he says I need to spend more time with her and that I’m giving her too much freedom. But all I want to do is nap after looking over a colicky baby.

On weekends when he has to work a lot, I pack up to go stay at my parents. I take the baby with me, but I can’t even leave until she gets out of school and I have to take her with me. I wouldn’t mind doing so, but she is always so disrespectful and rude to my family and when I scold her, all she does is scream so that she doesn’t have to hear me. I always end up feeling bad for staying with my family because of this. I cry all time.

Even now as I type this, she keeps knocking on my locked bedroom door. I just needed a moment to cry in peace while I put baby for his nap. But she keeps knocking on the door, which wakes up the baby, and I have to put him to sleep *again*. I just can’t stop crying and there are so many times where I want to just miss a pickup and go stay at my parents house for a few days with my baby *but I can’t*. 

I never expected to feel this way, but I also didn’t expect postpartum to hit me like this. Nothing I do is working with her. I’ve tried backing off and letting her do her own thing to keep the peace, but my husband gets upset with me for letting her watch TV all day.
Nothing is good enough. I can’t be the parent he wants me to be. But I can’t tell him that. I can’t tell him I want to die and that the only thing keeping me alive right now is our baby. I can’t tell him I don’t trust him alone with our baby and daughter because he hands the baby to her to hold while she’s standing up. She’s six year old and too young to hold a newborn if she isn’t sitting on the couch. I’ve had to take the baby back every time because I’m so afraid she’ll drop him. He’s even tried to make her hold the baby when she’s in a bad mood a few times and I’ve had to step in and say I’ll take the baby because I feel like she’ll drop him or throw him out of anger. 

This all just sucks.",
"Husband and I (both 30) have been married for two years, but together since college. He works a very intense job overnight (10p-6a) and rarely has days off. I postponed having a baby since I’ve felt very lonely for a while, mainly due to his lack of availability. He finally convinced me earlier this year and we welcomed a beautiful girl in October. He managed to get 6 weeks off and things were okay. After the 6 weeks, I decided to temporarily move back in with my parents once he returned to work; I couldn’t imagine getting through the rest of the newborn stage alone 2/3 of the day. It’s been almost two weeks at my parents and the loneliness is sinking in more than ever. My parents are truly wonderful and so incredibly supportive/helpful with the baby, but I wasn’t supposed to raise this baby with them. I’m falling into this empty place and feel so trapped. He doesn’t realize how his job affects us, even after talking, crying, begging, pleading… ",
"3 weeks pp. I'm all over the place. I'm not happy or sad but I want to cry. I feel happy when I look at him and hold him but I also feel so detached from everything. We had a good couple days when we got home from the hospital, my mom had to leave the second day and I miss her so much. Me and my boyfriend are doing okay but probably better on his side. Last week I walked in on him watching porn which 2 months ago wouldn't have bothered me but with my pp body, trying to breastfeed and pump to build up supply for work and then he's been on his phone so much, it hurt a lot. So many past and new insecurities came roaring up in my head, I shut down for a few days before I just started hysterically crying about it. He comforted me and apologized even though I told him he didn't need to be sorry about it, it's not a boundary that I realized I would have postpartum. 

I don't even necessarily care if he watches it, more just that he does it more discreetly so it's not in my head. But now it's all that's in my head, thanks to my ex who said horrible things about my body and cheated on me multiple times, all starting with him being on his phone alot more. All I can think is that he's looking for better options and I wasn't even good enough before so now I'm definitely not good enough now. And then I feel horrible because my boyfriend doesn't deserve these thoughts. He's the most supportive person I've ever had in my life, and I know he loves me but my brain refuses to accept that he loves me as much as he says.

And I've only been put of the house by myself twice and both were to the grocery store and i was panicking the whole time. But for him he still goes to school, he is going to a friend's birthday on Thursday and for him it's like nothing has changed when he's not home. He is beyond helpful and makes sure to give me my time to sleep when he gets up in the morning, he changes diapers, does tummy time and cooks food. I just don't know why I can't stop all of these negative thoughts, I want to go back to when we first got home and I wasn't thinking like this. ",
"Was diagnosed recently. My main factor (I feel, prior to a real counseling session) is sleep. I have severe insomnia. I am 4 weeks PP and still have not gotten more than a 2/3 hour shift of sleep at night and cannot nap during the day no matter what I try. 
 My fear is I have to go back to work in 2 weeks, I cannot function as is and need to keep my job. Has anyone been given medication that helped with sleep issues? ",
Said he didnt mean it but here i am hours later still contemplating on it,
"For context, I've dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a teen (now 30) and have been medicated for it for 12 years now. I continued taking all of my medications throughout my pregnancy. I'm only 4 days postpartum and I feel WEIRD. I don't know that I can explain it exactly and I don't know if or what the difference is between baby blues and PP depression. I don't feel depressed, really. I don't feel like myself, like a completely different version. I'm super overwhelmed thinking that I'll never get the rhythm of my new life down. I feel like because I don't feel like myself that my relationship now feels different and like it's all my fault. I also just overall feel very emotional. I'm really hoping that this is just hormone related and will get better because this feeling just is not it. ",
"I’ve made it 5 weeks and have felt great. I’ve lost weight, been staying active, keeping up with my household, and generally just feeling more like myself than when I was pregnant. I adore my baby and the newborn stage. He is a great sleeper, not just really a fussy baby, he’s just perfect! All of the sudden, today a huge sense of impending doom hit me. I have a huge family support system but i started to feel like every issue within my family is the end of the world. I know this doesn’t sound realistic but I started to feel like everything in my life is going wrong and I have no one to talk to. I ended up telling my husband when he could tell something was wrong and he just rubbed my back and told me everything would be okay he didn’t really know what else to say and i don’t even know what he could have said to make me feel better. I literally felt like my head was spinning and my heart was beating out of my chest. Immediately I found a psychiatrist to meet with this week because I do not want to fall into a depression I can’t crawl out of when I should be enjoying this precious time with my baby! What happened? Why did this hit me 5 weeks after having him? Is it just hormones? ",
"Started this medication Friday night. I feel nothing from it after two doses. Anyone with experience taking it, when did you start to notice a difference in your PPD/PPA? ",
"I’ve recently started on sertraline I’ve been on it for about 6 weeks and I feel horrible, worse than when I was before. My OB prescribed them for ppa&ppd. I’ve been having intrusive thoughts and panic attacks multiple times a week. I don’t want to leave my house or be around anyone and my mood is just very low overall because of these feelings. I don’t feel like harming myself or baby, but am scared that this will get worse? I’ve been gaslighting myself into not telling my ob fearing he’ll think I just want to extend my disability or something like that, but there’s no way I can go back to work in 3 weeks like this and I’m honestly just scared. Anyone else have a similar experience with sertraline? Should I stick it out or tell my doctor? ",
Please <3,
"I struggled with MDD and Anxiety most my life and especially during my pregnancy, which I was medicated and monitored. Post partum I've had some low days but been managing, so I thought.

Today, in a gesture of good will, my sister in law offered some of her BM stash, incase my son gets sick - my son is exclusively formula fed since leaving hospital, which was decided after much debate on the stress involved with EBF and how would I managed once I go back to work in 5 months time. I've had many nights where I've cried and felt like an imposter as I didn't have a natural labour and then chose not to breast feed.


I ended up getting a supply a few days after the delivery, and let it dry, though I will 'leak' in the shower a little and with little stimulation. So I feel even worse, as I am *capable* or breast feeding but feel like I've taken the easy route out.",
"I have an 8 month old daughter, and we just found out we are expecting our second! They will be 15 months apart. 

I have been very sick this first trimester, and am feeling very depressed. My husband is worried because I seem detached even from our daughter. I am just always so tired, and don’t really want to get out of bed or do much. It doesn’t help that our girl isn’t a great sleeper. I know I need to reach out to my doctor. I am still in the window for PPD but am not sure if it is a mix of both. 

Just looking to see if anyone has experienced this, and if it got better once first trimester passed? I would love to feel less alone/scared. Thank you!

Trying to survive an abusive relationship while being postpartum is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. I have no where to turn. I just want my baby to have a good life. ,
"I’m 4 weeks PP and I’m pretty sure I have PPD. My husband and I have been arguing basically every single day. I cry almost every single day, sometimes multiple times a day. 

He’s saying he’s going to leave if I can’t focus on our relationship and the baby but I just don’t know how to balance things. I feel like an awful wife and an awful mother. I’ve been skipping meals and waiting to go to the bathroom to make sure my baby has what he needs first. I can’t even prioritize myself, how can I prioritize my marriage right now? 

I’m starting to feel a lot of resentment and I know I have been short with him and I feel awful for it and I don’t mean to be that way. It’s just so hard to be happy and nice all the time about everything. I know this hurts him and I’ve explained this over and over again but because I keep doing it I know it’s wearing on him. It’s wearing on me too though. It’s so hard to see him as helping me in any way when I haven’t had more than 4 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period in the last 4 weeks. I have to pump around the clock since the baby won’t latch. I’m the one who soothes him when he won’t stop fussing all night, and wakes up at the smallest cry to feed and change him. Meanwhile my husband gets 8 hours of sleep and gets to tell me to go away when I ask for help at 3am because he’s a heavy sleeper. 

I’m so incredibly upset and sad anymore. I love my son more than anything, but I feel like having a baby destroyed my relationship. ",
"I (21f) am 4 months postpartum with my first child. Everything seemed to be going great for the first few months, I got decent sleep when my husband or other family would take the baby, I was able to take care of myself and my kiddo, I ate properly for the most part (which is a huge deal for me because I've always struggled to eat enough). But over the last month or so, everything just feels like it's fallen apart and I don't know what to do. 

I didn't realize what it was at first. I would just get really angry out of nowhere and have to leave my lo in his crib for a few moments so I could step out of the room to calm down. My husband and I have spent a lot of time arguing over pointless things that have nothing to do with anything. My best friend and I (who happens to be our roommate in whose house we live) have had several arguments over stupid shit. 

And then all of a sudden about a week ago it hit me like a freight train. I kinda just sat on my bed, a little dazed at the realization of why I've been so upset. I thought about all the things that might have led up to that moment and realized how blind I'd been to my own emotions...

I've always struggled to keep my space clean but then I'd realized just how dirty my house is. I've never been consistent with scheduling but I realized how late I stay in ben now, and how it feels impossible to get up to do anything. A few weeks ago, I'd been physically ill and kept blaming my lack of motivation on recovery but I don't think that's the case anymore.

And my baby spends significantly more time crying now than he has in the past thanks to sleep regression and what I think might be the onset of teething, maybe? 

And then to top it all off, I tried to get help today and it sorta just ended in failure. I'd seen decent reviews on BetterHelp but it wasn't until after I'd payed the $50+ for the week that I'd found out how they don't hold up to their own standards so I canceled it without even thinking about it and now I feel guilty for spending the money to begin with.

Anyways, I guess I just needed to get this out there just in case my mental state decides to completely crash and burn...

Does anyone else feel this way this long after having a baby? I thought postpartum depression was an immediate thing? Everyone has always told me that if you don't get depressed right after birth then you won't experience postpartum depression... 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has responded, it means a lot to know that I'm not in this alone. Personally, I think more people should be informed about the true nature of PPD and how it isn't an immediate thing like the nurses portray it as.",
Just wondering if anyone has taken any natural supplements to help with depression and anxiety and have they worked and which ones. I’m scared to take meds ,

"Terribly toxic thoughts of leaving my husband and my 4 week old baby because they are better off without me. I’m a part of an in person post partum group and I have my own therapist but when I’m there I’m usually feeling pretty good and can’t even remember feeling how I am feeling now. I guess I’ve been struggling since day one but more recently I’ve felt like I should just leave. I grew up with a mentally unstable mom and i wish she would had left me before I could remember her as she’s ruined my life

My husband has been tending to the baby mostly because I can’t get it together he’s a great father

He’s about to go back to work and he’s worried because “I can’t even sooth our baby”
Like I’m not worried? Ugh

Out of the week I will be great for like 2 days then have 2 bad days. When it’s bad I seem to forget the good and when it’s good I can’t seem to remember the bad.

I planned a natural homebirth, got hypertension and all plans out the window. Breast feeding didn’t work he wouldn’t latch and I’ve been to two lactation consultants and had him checked for ties.
I do great to make 1.5 oz breast milk a pumping so not no where near enough.
I am not enough.

He cries and dad can fix it, I get over why and cry myself. 

I want to go back to work full time NOW and have him stay home. He always gets mad and quits jobs, I love my career. I can’t do this mom stuff worth a shit.
All my dreams turned in to nightmares. I wanted to be a stay at home mom and I’ve changed my mind on that too.

I’ve been crying and laying in the bathroom floor all day while my husband is being fantastic with my perfect baby boy and I can’t appreciate anything 

I stress so hard about money and my nice nice savings account is now drained to almost living pay check to pay check and I just can’t seem to shake all my worries.

Husband quit his job even though he did find one and starts monday, he always does this randomly. I don’t want him miserable at work but it’s so stressful for me never feeling security 

I’m not going to eat I’m not going to pump and I am not going to take that a blood pressure pill… I feel so done ",
"I just had my second baby girl 5 days ago and she is precious.  Absolutely precious and I love her so so much.  I had a difficult second pregnancy in that I ywas in much more pain and discomfort and chasing around my toddler made me exhausted and at times even depressed.  

With my first born, I noticed days into being home that I was grieving my pregnancy.  My first was an easy pregnancy but very difficult baby as I adjusted to her high needs as well as just being a mother in general.  She’s now 27 months and we have had so many hills and valleys, tears and joy, and I’ve made it through each sleep regression and transition.  I look at her now and she’s so big compared to my newborn.  I wonder if I have the strength to go through these early years all over again. 

That being said I am grieving my second pregnancy now too despite how hard it was.  Why does this happen?  I wanted her here so badly and I was miserable pregnant, but for some reason I also miss those 9 months.  I get used to being pregnant and have just a different connection when they are in utero. I thought it was just a first born thing but I’m finding I’m missing my second pregnancy too. 

I also like pregnancy hormones over postpartum hormones.  PP hormones are the worst.  The sadness, the crying, the anxiety, the “doom” feeling.  It sucks.  I was in much more control of myself when pregnant. ",

"Anyone else with PPD feel this way?? 
I am 7 weeks postpartum and I am feeling hopeless. I feel so disconnected from everything and everyone since probably a week after giving birth. It is such a horrible feeling. It's like I'm present but at the same time I'm not. I have never felt this way before. I am struggling. I did see a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with PPD.

I am so happy our son is here and I love him so much. He's so cute. Over the last couple days I have noticed I start the day feeling pretty good and in good spirits, but as the day goes on some feelings of doom start to creep in. I just already feel like I miss my freedom a little and I miss my husband so much even though he is in the same room as me. I miss our intimacy and being able to go out and do whatever whenever and we are only 5 days into this thing. I miss our slow evenings at home together and making dinner for us. I miss showering together. I know having a child is the biggest life change someone can go through and it will all just take time to adjust, but in the meantime I just feel sad.

"I have a question about the terminology of ppd. I understand that depression can be caused by hormonal or brain chemical imbalances and also by situational factors.

"I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1b75ack/my_experience_with_zurzuvae/) so helpful when I was deciding whether or not to take medication for my postpartum depression, I wanted to add my own experience so other folks looking for help have more information.

TL;DR this medication saved me. I feel like myself again, and the side effects were tolerable. I will shout its praise from the rooftops

**Background**

I gave birth in September. FTM, mid 30s, I had an easy pregnancy. I've had several bouts of depression over the course of my life and struggle greatly with anxiety.  I have always been resistant to taking SSRIs due to a bad experience with Zoloft years ago and being impatient with how long they take to work if you respond badly to one.

I had a rough birth and the first few weeks of postpartum were mostly survival mode, but I started feeling the old ugly feelings of depression getting stronger and stronger around week 4. Absolute feelings of failure, crying a lot, just unable to feel any joy. Feeling way too overwhelmed, weeping when I would look at my beautiful daughter because I felt like I was failing her. Failing at everything . Along with strong feelings of self harm which really scared me because I've never had that before. I got flagged by the depression screen at my 6 week appointment and my doctor suggested Zurzuvae. I was intrigued by the short dosage timeframe (you only have to take it for 14 days) and went and did all my internet research on it. I decided to try to get it.

My insuranced needed a prior authorization, but the process all happened behind the scenes. My regular pharmacy couldn't fill the order so they sent it to a specialty pharmacy. The sticker cost was $16k!!! My copay would have been $60, but the pharmacy was able to apply a manufacturer coupon and it cost me $0.

**Administration and side effects**

You have to take it at night (my doctor said it was fine to take with dinner like 6-7pm but be prepared to zonk out after, more on that later) and with a lot of fat in a 400+ calorie meal so it absorbs properly. I found this easy to do! I would rotate through some mixture of the following if my dinner wasn't fatty enough: avocado toast, a couple hard boiled eggs and strips of bacon, or a couple spoons of peanut butter and a slice of cheese, a serving of cashews... ""girl dinner"". I usually took it around 8pm.

It made me SUPER drowsy the first few nights. Like I would fall asleep on the couch within 30-1hr of taking it. For the rest of the course of medication I found I could take it a little earlier in the evening and it didn't affect my sleep at all. It made me sleep SUPER deeply regardless. My husband does overnight baby duty and good thing - I literally would barely wake up to the baby. (I do think if she cried loud enough I would have but it was crazy how hard it was to rouse me).  I am lucky to have an incredible partner who was able to support me and allow me to get deep sleep every night so I could focus on healing my mind.

The morning grogginess was a whole other level. It was beyond grogginess. I was very wobbly and felt drunk most mornings - especially if my sleep was disrupted. If you've ever taken a Benadryl and stayed up afterwards, it felt like that. They are serious about not driving within 12 hours of taking it and I would wholeheartedly echo that recommendation, your reaction time is very off. I also had a weird side effect where my grip felt really weak in the mornings? Like it was hard to grasp things and I was kinda trembly. That went away after an hour or so every morning, and has not persisted since I stopped the medication. I was able to care normally for the baby during the day.

**Did it actually work?**

YES!!!! By day 2 I already felt it working. I literally felt my spirits lifting day by day. I stopped weeping. I started smiling. By day 4-5 that hateful voice in my head was already silenced, I started speaking to myself with more compassion and feeling like things were funny again. It felt like I was emerging from a deep, black pit and could see the sunlight again. By day 10 I remember distinctly thinking ""Wow, I feel so HAPPY"" and realizing I hadn't felt that in weeks. The best way to describe it ultimately is I FELT LIKE MYSELF AGAIN. It felt like it was a different person talking to me in the mirror every day while I was in the grips of postpartum depression and now I feel completely back to myself.

**Breast milk**

I was pumping at the time and ultimately decided to continue feeding my baby milk (we supplement 50/50 with formula). The studies on how much pass into breastmilk and what the effects may be are limited, but my pediatrician said she was comfortable with it and I trust her opinion. No effects noticed on baby, she is happy as can be and eating and sleeping well. I personally believed the benefits of continuing to give her breastmilk outweighed the unknown risks, and I was reassured by my pediatrician's response. I saw no effect on my milk supply negative or positive, but I was able to relax more and stop stressing / spiraling about pumping so much (iykyk).

**Other thoughts**

Other than the morning grogs, I had no other side effects and the benefits were immense. I will say it hasn't helped much with the anxiety side of things, I am still working through that. My doc warned it might not, so I was not surprised. I am doing talk therapy and starting on Buspar. But I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling with depression, I could not believe how well it worked and I am so thankful my doc recommended it.

I am curious to see how long the effects last (It's only been a few days since I stopped taking it). I can do an update post in a couple weeks if anybody is interested. Let me know if you have any questions, happy to share more.",
"I know the title sounds bad, and honestly it kind of is. I’m 3 month postpartum, and anxiety and depression have really set in within the last month. I’ve been dealing with postpartum rage as well that has been going on since 4 weeks postpartum. I am on medication and I am in therapy… just trying to be proactive since I have a history of mental illness and severe ppd from my first (5yo). 

The past two months have been HARD. But it’s not from the newborn… she’s been a dream baby. She’s been so easy! It’s my 5yo. It seems like everything she does just gets on my nerves. She is rude and sometimes mean. She’s been extra needy, too, which I get she’s a little kid and used to being an only child but it’s the whining I cannot stand. I get so worked up, like my body gets tense, I get filled with rage and it’s like I actually feel my blood pressure rise. I remind myself that she’s not annoying, I’m just annoyed…. But no. She’s annoying and there are times I cannot stand her. Im sick of hearing “mom” and “mama” every 30 fucking seconds. I feel so awful about it and I’m trying to work through it. I love her more than anything, but now I’m finding it hard to balance the baby and her at the same. I snap at times, but I’m working on coping mechanisms to control it, but I always apologize when I do. I try to turn it into a teaching moment and it also helps me to talk through it with her, but now she’s calling me a bad mom. It hurts my heart and a lot of times I feel like I am. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a mom. 

I dread picking her up from school every single day because it’s just the baby, her, and me for at least 3 hours until my husband gets home. I love her smile and how excited she gets when she sees me in car line, but then we get home and it’s like she purposely pushes all of my buttons and tries to make me mad. She thinks it’s hilarious. I will ask her what she wants for snack, something to drink, what she wants to do, but she never wants anything until I sit down to nurse the baby and now I’m stuck. I tell her she has to wait because I already asked her at least 3 times, but then she will throw a tantrum. Some days are really good, but others make me want to drive away and not come back. I love her soooooooo much, but why can’t I stand her a lot of the time? ",

"Will be starting this medication tonight for PPD. 6 weeks postpartum and just not feeling any joy with caring for my baby or living life. Dr strongly recommended this medicatioon which was difficult to get. Insurance did not approve it at 1st, it needed a prior authorization. It took a couple weeks for all that to come together but it's being delivered today. After everything I've read, a little nervous to start. The fall risk is what scares me. Just wondering for anyone else who's been on this, how it was for you? ",
I am not sure what’s wrong with me. I am a first time mom and whenever my baby cries or she doesn’t listen or just I simply don’t know what she wants it overwhelms me and sorta over stimulates me to the point where I want to lose my shit and I just hand her over to my partner or my mother. I hate that feeling. I am the only child so I never had to deal with sibling crying all the time or any noise in the house which makes me wonder if it’s just a feeling I am not used to (my baby crying). I try to be patient but i sometimes can’t and rather have someone else deal with it. Is there any ways you guys have found that have helped you? I want to be better for my baby and be able to have patience with her and be there for her. ,
"I apologise in advance for the length of this post. I just need to release all of this somewhere.

My baby boy is almost 11 months old and he is the sweetest, easiest baby and I love him to pieces. But I have found motherhood so hard from the start. I have suffered from anxiety for a long time, with periods of low mood, but things have been so so bad probably since I got pregnant.

The early days PP were terrible. Then things got a little easier and I started to feel more like myself again a few months in, but it’s been a constant struggle to stay afloat. Im in a constant state of burnout and overwhelm with all the responsibility and decision making, and have been finding staying at home very isolating. Every now and again I have brief periods of feeling a degree of positivity, but then the persistent low mood sets in again. 

I live in the UK and since autumn has set in seasonal depression has hit on top of PPD, then I lost a pet last week and now I am just at rock bottom. I can’t bear to be in the house alone with my thoughts anymore, but my baby is still non-mobile and has a nap schedule which means I am somewhat limited in what I can do to get out and about. 

I’ve started going back to work 2 days a week and this helped somewhat, but I’m a veterinary nurse and lost the pet I’m currently grieving at my workplace, so even this now feels tainted to me. 

I’ve also started just abandoning morning nap and getting out to baby groups etc or seeing a friend, because I just find mornings at home so hard, but then the naps are off for the rest of the day which comes with other challenges trying to keep a tired baby entertained for hours. 

I do a lot of walking to try and get sunlight (although as I said in the UK it’s so limited right now) and exercise, I’m on medication and see a therapist. But I’m so sick of feeling like this. I want to experience joy again. I look at other people and wish I could be happy like them. I feel like I’m constantly fighting through a fog and it’s so much effort. 

What else can I do? Has anybody else come through the other side of this? I just don’t know what more I can do and I’m so tired of feeling this way. ",

"10 weeks post partum FTM. I thought things might be getting better when I stopped pumping at 6 weeks but it’s gotten much worse. 

I have rage at my partner. Suicidal ideation. And cry almost every day. I feel numb, don’t enjoy anything anymore and don’t want to see anyone. I hate myself and am repulsed by my body after giving birth. I’ve had episodes like this before but not like this where I can’t pull myself out of it 

The problem has nothing to do with baby, he’s sleeping well and healthy and my partner is wonderful with him. I just don’t know who I am anymore. 

Anyone think medication will help ? Or what meds in particular?  I’m terrified that I’ll gain even more weight and lose my sex drive completely and just hate myself even more ",
"I am a FTM and 5 weeks postpartum. I am just so angry and anxious all the time. I feel like no one understands what I am going through and I just want to cry. I’ve become very forgetful too. I dont remember anything. What time I fed my baby or what day it is. I zone out when a conversation is taking place and I can’t talk much. I am not able to talk. My brain is so fuzzy that I am not able to think straight. If anyone here has gone through something similar, please tell me I’ll get better. I need hope. ",
"Hi,
I have a beautiful 2 months old baby boy. He was super wanted and he filled our hearts with so much love since the first moment he was born.
I have OCD and intrusive thoughts since 3 years ago buy with Lexapro and therapy I was managing well during pregnancy until 5 weeks after delivery when the hell started.
As mentioned above, I was doing amazing until 5 weeks postpartum. I started to get intrusive thoughts about my baby and my OCD and anxiety have been through the roof since then. 
Lately, I feel very anxious and sad, mainly of the thought that the connection and bond I had with my baby is gone. I hate feeling like that. I just want to be the perfect mammy for him and to love him so much. Everyday I pray I wake up the next morning and I stop feeling like this, as this feeling, the thought of it and the guilt are all I think about it all day. My anxiety levels are that high that my chest gets very tight sometimes. 
I am taking Lexapro still and doctor upped the dose a month ago but I can’t see any improvements yet.
I was always a very kind and loving person who loved children and I don’t understand why am I feeling like that if my beautiful baby boy is all I ever asked for.
Please came here to hear successful recovery histories and get tips so I can have the hope that things will get better and this will pass.
Thank you so much! ",
"I’m 4 weeks pp and struggling. This is my second baby and after an unsuccessful breastfeeding journey with my first I absolutely had my heart set on nursing my second. It hasn’t worked out, for a bunch of reasons (interference by doctors in hospitals forcing us to supplement with formula due to low blood sugar, a uterine infection at 8 days pp which resulted in me getting very ill for a week, and a boisterous 2 year old that needs a lot of love and attention - which I chose over pumping). 

I have so many regrets. Why didn’t I get a hands free pump so I could pump more in the earlier days when we had to supplement with formula? Why didn’t I learn about the potential of low blood sugar complications and what that could mean for feeding, when I knew my baby was going to be large for gestational age. Maybe I did have gestational diabetes even though the test said I didn’t, should I have requested a second one later into my third trimester? I can’t stop going over all the scenarios and every time I see someone breastfeeding or a tiktok of a mum with over supply, tears begin to well up. 

I need to move on, how do I forgive myself? How do I move past the guilt and feeling like an absolute failure for not being able to do this most basic thing. It’s just embarrassing. 

I want to be a good mum to my toddler who at the moment has a short tempered and slightly checked out mum and it’s not fair on them. I need to get better.",
"Im almost one year PP and feel like absolute SHIT. My eyesight went to shit after pregnancy and my drs can’t figure out how to correct it. I’m fatigued, depressed, losing weight from stress, breaking out, weeks late on my period but not pregnant. I’ve seen countless doctors but none have helped. I started a second antidepressant that may be leading to my weight loss. WTF can I do to figure myself out? I’m at my wits end. My child is the light of my life but I can’t properly enjoy life with her while feeling like crap. Help ���� ",
"I feel like this is a cry for help. But there's no other way of describing it because I feel like I'm at breaking point. 
I love my children it has taken me and my husband 4 years, 3 miscarriages and so much heartache to get here but I feel like I don't even know who I am. 
My eldest is 3, my pregnancy was rough and I had a traumatic birth. It was in COVID which didn't help but I was diagnosed with postpartum anxiety and maternal OCD.
It took a lot of therapy to get to a place where I was relatively 'normal' again. My OCD never went away but it was manageable. 
We decided after 1 1/2 to try for another baby and sadly I had 2 miscarriages. I then fell pregnant with my youngest and had another horrendous pregnancy. 
After my youngest was born we had constant issues, from infections to pyloric stenosis. Him needing to surgeries and multiple hospital says. 
It's safe to say my mental health is the worst it has been and I honestly hate everything about my life. I'm in therapy, I'm on medication I am doing everything I possibly can and it never seems to make a difference. 
I feel like it's getting worse.
I never expected to feel this way. I don't want to be around my eldest. I'm struggling to cope with my youngest. 
My husband has been made redundant and the stress is just too much . I recently lost my godmother who was more of a mother to me than anything and it's just too much.

I simply do not know how to keep doing it. I just want to shut down. I want to walk away.

My entire life I wanted children, my children are so wanted and so loved. But my brain is ruining it for me and I don't know what else I can do. ",
"Last night, my significant other left to party with his single friends all night, then expected me to take care of his daughter when he came home because he went to go pick her up. I raged and I was so angry because he left me without a vehicle to move around in. I told him that if he left, he would be coming back to an empty house. I felt this rage and anger overpower me, it’s something I have never felt before. So I accidentally threw a candle that broke the stove glass out of anger because he would just say he was coming home and never got home. So I packed a suitcase and walked to the nearest hotel with my baby. Then I caught a ride to my parent’s house, which is an hour away from where I was at. He didn’t believe that I would leave and now he just told me he was done with me and that I was low class and that he was so disappointed. 
For background context, we have been disagreeing A LOT. Arguing back and forth and he blames it on me. That I am the problem, that I’m the miserable one, that I am bringing him down with me. It’s hard for me to accept that I’m the problem but he makes it seem like I am so crazy and angry all the time. Of course I’m going to be angry when I have to juggle house chores and taking care of baby and he just comes home and sleeps. 

Am I crazy? Am I taking it too far?",
"I gave birth 3 years ago. During my third trimester my personality started changing. I stopped taking care of myself, eating, making doctor's appointments etc. My husband was obviously really concerned that I was dropping my responsibility of taking care of myself and my unborn child and he tried to take on the these I was leaving behind. Immediately after birth, I suffered from a severe spinal headache and what I now know to be postpartum depression. I don't remember much, but my husband has told me that he had to make me breast feed my daughter even though that was my plan and desire and it was terrifying for him because our daughter would not take a bottle. He felt helpless. At the time I was constantly feeling unsupported by him even though he was doing 90% of the work with our newborn and waiting on me while I recovered from my headache. After the headache subsided, the depression remained and when he tried to talk to me about it or have me seek help, I denied everything and blamed him for what I was going through. I finally started seeing a therapist and taking meds about 6 months after my daughter was born but I still persisted in trying to place blame on him whenever I was acting or treating him poorly. This caused him severe emotional trauma and I am only beginning to understand and take accountability for the things that I did and said after birth. We still have horrible relationship issues mostly stemming from my not listening to him in the beginning stages of our ordeal and not taking any accountability for my actions until very recently. I wanted to hear the opinions and experiences of others who went through postpartum and how it affected both sides of the relationship. Were you able to heal?

Also, I was diagnosed with ADHD about 2 years ago. Symptoms were not obvious until after I had given birth.",
"well.. I tried medicine for the first time for my depression and my brain can't catch up to what the meds are doing to me. I went into a psychosis after I had my son.  thought I was fine until I wasn't fine at all. Honestly, I am barely hanging on right now and I have to educate myself on why this is happening to me or what type of chemical imbalance am i experiencing for me to fall off the edge the moment I had the baby.  I don't feel anything negative toward my son he's my whole world. this is a personal thing within myself that I can't overcome.  This feels like my brain is covered in a plastic bag being suffocated. I can't get out of it, the medicine gave me horrible symptoms and brought me down deeper than I was already with standing. just when I feel like I reached my limit I get pulled in deeper. the only thing keeping me here right now is knowing that I have a tiny human who depends on me to make this work... I can't find housing and my boyfriend is my enemy right now. I shouldn't have gotten into a relationship at all. after finding out i was having a baby i should have stayed to myself and run with it. i thought I found my person but every day I question it and he knows why,.  maybe just maybe when this is all over ill get it right and everything will fall into place. i have bad luck with boys and bad luck with finding housing. ",
"I am a single mother by choice. I conceived via IVF.
My pregnancy was not too bad, I had horrible hyperemesis and had preeclampsia  the very end of my pregnancy and posteclampsia. I had a c-section with my mother with me, then was immediately alone with my son. I barely slept for 5 days before baby blues hit. I was crying at the drop of a hat. At one point I cried because I saw a tree. I was exhausted and my son would be wide awake from 11pm to 3am every night. I was struggling as I didn’t have help. After the first month past things got easier. I lucky out immensely. He started sleeping through the night at 1 month. Our sleep regressions have been minimal. He eats well. He has CMPA and reflux, but all in all he is so good. He isn’t a crier, he longs just hanging out. Super chill. It wasn’t until right before the 5 month mark that I started to go down a dark road, it felt like the edges of my sanity were starting to fray. I knew what was happening and I could see I was being overly emotional and all over the place. Still no one said anything to me, but then again almost everyone pulled away from me. It wasn’t until a couple weeks later that I put the pieces together that it was PPD. I went to the doctors and got meds and started them right away, it was night and day.
When I talked to the people who were around me they went “ya we saw it, you stopped doing stuff for us”. Which was a whole other blow that I had to take. People only paid attention because I stopped doing things for them? 

Post partum definitely showed me a lot, and opened my eyes to a lot. 
",
"I am 18 weeks pp. I have been experiencing ppd and have been on meds for over a year for anxiety / depression. My depression hasn’t gotten any better, should I try a different medication or a different dosage? I really thought I would be better by now. Any tips or encouraging words?",
"Is this the same for anyone else? My first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. It took me 2 years to conceive as i have pcos and don’t ovulate regularly. How do i move on and get ready to try again? All i want is to conceive again but i cant cope with another loss. Ive been bed ridden with depression for weeks now. Does anyone relate, have stories of hope, anything?",
Just venting as a first time mom- I’m 8 weeks postpartum and I’ve had a few episodes of depression since having my baby but this past week I swear it’s come out of nowhere and hit me hard. I didn’t realize how hard PPD can hit you � I saw my OB yesterday and I’m supposed to start Lexapro and therapy. Anyone have any experience with staring Lexapro postpartum?,
I have 2 boys my oldest is almost 2 and my youngest is 5 months old i instantly had a connection with my first but my second I love with all my heart but we just haven't bonded when he cries I cry I dread the night time and honestly I feel absolutely terrible about it I had postpartum depression with my first but it was mostly cause I was scared something would happen to him or someone was going to take him my ob also diagnosed me with PPD this time as well and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong he is almost 6 months old why do I still feel this way? I had high risk pregnancy with both of them both pregnancies were miserable and due to some medical problems will never be able to have another child he is my last and I feel like a shitty mother for having these feelings and not enjoying him while he is still a baby. ,
"I'm 10 weeks postpartum today, and over the last 3 weeks I've slowly been getting more and more depressed & anxious. It's to the point that I'm barely sleeping because I just jolt awake from nightmares & can't go back to sleep, and since I'm getting so little sleep I'm irritable & depressed all day. I went back to work (an extremely mentally draining job) 6 weeks postpartum, & I honestly wanted to quit while I was still pregnant but now it's 100 times worse. I dread going in every day & I'm not doing a good job there, which makes me feel even worse. I just feel like there's so much weight on my shoulders, despite having my baby's father, and some family & friends that help out. Tonight I rage cleaned my house because, according to my partner, I ""never do anything"" on my days off. Im trying so hard but it's literally never enough. I self harmed for many years but haven't for the last 4. While washing dishes I had the overwhelming urge to do it, I had to walk away and just cry and scream it out because I am terrified that my baby will be taken from me if I do anything like that. Sorry for the rant, I just don't want to open up to anyone I know irl for the same reason. I just wish I would've listened to everyone who told me that a baby would only make life harder... I love her SO much but I already feel like a shitty mom & like I'm failing her.",
"I’m almost 11 months pp and in many ways I still feel like I’m still on the thick of my pp journey. I’ve hardly lost any of the baby weight, I’m tired all the time, and I just feel not like me. People not in my immediate circle keep telling me that I need to prioritise myself but we have no extra help- it’s just me and my husband. I’m doing all I can with my resources I exercise twice a week at an exercise class where I can bring the baby along and I get out to move/walk with baby daily. We sleep trained baby so I get a few hours at night to myself. I’m EBF (baby will no longer take a bottle etc) and I’m wondering if this is the thing that’s stopping me from losing the weight and if it’s causing me too much stress in general. I have mum friends but it still all just doesn’t feel enough. I’m not happy and I’m just yearning for a day when I can leave him with someone I trust for like a day.  But then I feel guilty at the mere thought of that. I haven’t left him longer than 3 hours since he’s been born and I can count how many times I’ve done that. My husband travels for work and I often get resentful that he gets time away while I’m alone watching the baby 24/7. I feel like my old self is completely gone and I look in the mirror and I don’t recognise the person staring back at me. Is this normal? What do I do?  ",
"I had my son 5 weeks ago.  My daughter is 5 years old.  My son was in the NICU for 23 days due to not breathing well at birth.  This is exactly what happened to his sister. They say it's just bad luck or they don't know why it happened to both my babies. My son went home in a feeding tube and it's the same story with his sister.  She got her feeding tube out at two months old.  He isn't doing that great with feeding and it's so incredibly frustrating. This wasn't suppose to happen twice.  I feel so alone and sad and guilty. Should I have even had a 2nd kid? Is it even fair to my 5 year old to suddenly have 75% less attention? Will she feel neglected even if I take an hour per day to play with her?  I don't have patience to deal with these feeding issues. Health insurance is being bitchy. The short term disability company and who also facilitate FMLA keep telling me different stories as to when I have to return to work.  I literally bawled on the phone with short term disability today because they're saying I have to return to with next week. I'm so on edge and just want to panic 24/7. I miss the NICU because I had so much support there and I didn't have to do nearly every feeding. All I do is pump breast milk, feed baby, change diapers, and try to find time to clean cook and be a good mom to my 5 year old.  I'm really really struggling with no end in sight.  ",
"When do you start to feel like yourself again. I feel so off and out of it. And I’m so far from even asking for help I just need to get back to regular old me. I’m tired of the mood swings. One moment I’m fine the next I’m feeling down, then I’m angry and it’s not just a normal angry. It’s like a feeling of rage I can’t explain and I’m so over feeling like this. Therapy isn’t helping either.As a ftm I’m starting to feel helpless. Any advice or tips on how to get through this? I’d really appreciate it.",
"I feel so angry

Im working a shitty, essentially kitchen helper, its so fucking boring, I wanted to work up front and i hate my job, im starting to get really lazy at my job its what happens when i feel so much anger towards it plus it’s boring job

I had a doctor referred me to a psych because they think its possible that i might have something more then postpartum depression, they didn’t gave me meds 


The psych didnt want to follow my schedule like accommodate me,  wanted to set up a consultation on.a day that I’m working 
And I can’t take days off

So im gonna ask a doctor if they can referred me to a different psych that’s is way more accommodating 


What things pisses you off recently?

"I have been admitted in the hospital mental ward because I have been having hallucinations, intrusive thoughts about harming myself and paranoia that there is an old crooked man with long nails living in my home that wants to harm my baby and my partner. I feel its watching over me all the time with pure hatred and anger. I came to the point where I’m terrified of putting my baby in the crib and go to another room because I feel like every time I’m gonna put him down whatever it is, is gonna take him away from me. I was previously diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety and have had issues with self harm and tried to unalive myself. Right now I wanna live more than ever for my baby. I love him so much. I might have to stay in the hospital for a week. It’s only been 12 hours and I’m already crying uncontrollably because I just wanna pick him up and hold him. I miss him so much. I don’t know how am I gonna survive one week without him. He is in good hands. My husband’s entire family is there to look after him and they are extremely supportive. But I still can’t help checking the baby monitor and every time he cries I start sobbing because I can’t hold him and comfort him. I feel like a bad mother. Like he doesn’t deserve me. I’m scared he’s gonna hate me and forget about me. I don’t how to survive this. ",
I have been suffering from general anxiety disorder and postpartum depression. I’ve started therapy and saw a doctor who prescribed Cymbalta. A few years ago I tried Zoloft and Prozac for general anxiety and stopped due to side effects. I was managing well with diet and excercise until pregnancy when my anxiety worsened. Delivered at 36 weeks due to cholestasis and had a very colicky/acid reflux baby. After my husband went back to work I would say I developed the PPD along with anxiety being bad in general. I would rather not go back on a medication due to past experiences. What has everyone done for treatment that worked for them? Open to stories of meds and no meds. Thanks in advance!,
"I’m 5 weeks PP & have felt a bit disconnected from my son since pregnancy. It was not a good experience. First couple of weeks I had bad PPA that made connecting that much harder. My son is starting the crying for no obvious reason phase & the last couple of days I noticed actual tears coming out of his eyes/down the side of his face. I can’t explain it, but I found it both cute & sad. Such a little person shouldn’t have tears. In a weird way, it makes me feel like I am starting to connect with him & that makes me happy although we are suffering through the newborn trenches right now and it’s been absolutely hell. 

It’s almost like the tears humanize him & they break my heart a little, which makes me want to cuddle him. I hope this means we’re making progress. ",
"I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here! I don't know if this is only for women with post partum depression to post about their experiences. I am a man who has no children. If this doesn't belong here I will delete the post. 

I have recently discovered that my mother who died when I was 5 had major post partum depression from the time of my birth. I had inclinations of this, like a clear memory of her pushing me away as an infant. After she died she was remembered as a 'private' person who enjoyed solitude but I think that was more peoples' perception of how she was after giving birth to me as she began to isolate a lot. 

I have always struggled with the guilt that I was not a good son to her and I caused her to be unwell. I don't know how to deal with the fact that my mother struggled with me and I can't get over feeling rejected by her. I wonder if anyone has any advice for me?

"This is probably not appropriate but I just need to get it out of my chest. I’m 7 weeks postpartum and my libido has increased significantly. Last week, in bed I tried to touch him and he took my hand away saying it’s okay that I’m tired from minding our baby, I said I’m not tired. Then he says because our 6 weeks old son was in the same room with us. I said ok, but I lowkey still felt embarrassed and unwanted. Few days later I was changing the rubbish bag in the bathroom and notice used tissues smell exactly like semen, the smell was strong, I didn’t have to bring it close to my nose . I felt betrayed, he’d rather masturbate then let me do it for him. I gained a lot of weight during the pregnancy, that plus i oversaw him and female coworker reacting each other’s message with heart made me evern more insecure, and that he’s probably not attracted to me anymore. 

We ended up leaving our baby with my mum and met up for dinner to talk about this. He said he’s still attracted to me but want to take it slow when it comes to us being intimate. And that he only heart reacted his colleague’ s message because she was talking about our baby, he offered to show me the whole conversation. But I refused.

A few night later, we were cuddling, and this time our baby stayed in my mum’s room. Still nothing happened. I tried to touch him but he pushed my hand away saying he’s tired and then just cuddled me. I feel like I have no dignity left at this point and feel disgusted of myself.

The next day I messaged and asked him what did he mean when he said he wanted to take it slow, I asked how long, he said a week ( a few has almost gone past). I don’t understand, he used to have high libido and was the one who initiated it most of the time and now he just keeps rejecting me. Same thing happened tonight, we cuddled a bit, he stroked my legs but then just stopped and went to be. I’m very sexually frustrated and I’m starting to feel like this will never happen. Should I tell him that I’m sexually frustrated ? 
Thank you for reading",
"My baby at one week of age one afternoon had to be taken to A&E. thankfully he was ok and we could go home a few hours later… around 11pm. 
The next morning I managed to get him to sleep and I fell asleep too.
My husband came in the bedroom, woke me up. He was hitting the end of the bed at my feet (not my feet). He was angry, I’d never seen him like that before. He had just talked to his mother who was threatening him to disown him if they cannot come and spend that Christmas with us (our first baby’s first Christmas at six weeks of age). Husband told me it’s all my fault that his mother turned on him.
Before birth we sat down and discussed our post partum plans with both set of grandparents (they all live abroad). Everyone understood and agreed.
I did not expect this. 
Apparently even in the hospital, my MIL was throwing tantrums over the phone and demanded my husband to book a flight for them, for only 2 days to see the baby. My husband kept all these from me. I wasn’t aware any of this when in hospital (was also in pain post c section and trying to breastfeed)… 
Since he apologised. But hadn’t changed much.
It’s all flaring up and I’m kind of reliving these experiences (and how he allowed his family to treat me) as my child’s birthday is coming close. I can’t look at those newborn pictures either as it all reminds me of how helpless, disappointed and confused I felt then…. 
",
"I'm 8 weeks postpartum and I have not really felt happy about this whole experience. I was miserable during my pregnancy with issues and now the baby's responsibly is mainly on me and I feel like I haven't had a break.

I rarely feel happy. I don't get enough sleep. I feel annoyed and frustrated with my husband that he can't do more. Everything about our home and family rests on my shoulders and now a baby. 

There's times I want to just leave and walk out and take the car and drive away. I am just pushing myself to keep going. I question at times whether this was what I wanted and sadly there are no returns but to keep moving forward. 

I feel like I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like I'm drowning. There's days where I think about what life would be like if I wasn't around or I became terminally ill. And making sure my husband and baby are financially ok if I one day am no longer around. 

I haven't had suicidal thoughts but I have thought about what if death came upon me, and what would that look like. ",
"I am a terrible mother and need to confess to the internet. I yelled at a stranger in front of my 11-week-old I mean, really lost my marbles, screaming at the top of my lungs, I almost punched her. Why isn't important, nothing should cause that.  I did it in front of my partner and he says I violated a huge boundary. He hates public scenes and is embarrassed by me. I embarrassed myself. 

Then I tried to take a bath today during her nap and didn't hear my baby wake up and cry. My husband had to take her while he was on a work call. I then realized I forgot to change her. She had two blow outs back to back this morning (which I changed and cleaned her) and then she sat in the same diaper for 7 1/2 hours. She was leaking pee and I thought we had to size up diapers until my husband went to log the heavy pee diaper and realized my neglect. 

I feel so awful. I've been battling daydreams of suicide since the screaming incident but know that isn't an option now that I have my daughter. While I do think she would be better off without me, it would be too much for my husband to handle. And I think about my own mom and how much it would hurt her. So I have to stay alive, knowing I'm a worthless, terrible mother. Maybe it's a fit punishment for me?

She's a happy baby in spite of me, I don't deserve her. I just wish I could be happy for her because that's what she deserves. 

Living inside my mind is torture. I have a therapist but she cares more about the baby than me. I have a history of treatment-resistant depression and faulty serotonin receptors so SSRIs don't work. I've done ketamine therapy successfully pre baby but it didn't seem to work postpartum. I finally started zuzurvae but had to pump and dump for two weeks (tomorrow is the last day) and LO was vomiting the formula. I felt so horrible and guilty about causing my baby to be sick but my husband convinced me that it was important to try and improve my mental health. When I was talking to my therapist about it she recommended I stop the zurzuvae (at the time of the session I thought it was helping) when I texted her to ask for an additional session (we were every other week) after the screaming incident she asked about if the baby was keeping down formula and not about how I was doing. Then she canceled the extra session (reasonably) because she's sick. (There's a part of me that thinks she's avoiding me because she thinks I'm a bad mom too and doesn't know how to support me). So long and short to say, I'm trying therapy but it's making me feel more guilty and selfish, and I don't think the meds are working either. 

I'm so miserable and I know I'm making my husbands life awful by being like this. He's dealing with his own mental health issues and taking on way more than most fathers because I'm such a failure. 

To top it off I've developed urge urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence. I can't trust my own body and feel like I can't leave the house. I tried talking to my mom about it and she just said ""oh dear"" and changed the subject. She sent us some soup on Grubhub, she's a good mom just not good at the emotional support. (I'm in pelvic floor therapy, I started at 20 weeks pregnant because of a predisposition to these issues and it still happened) 

Who do I think I am bringing a child into this world? I'm not equipped for this, she's going to have an absent, depressed mother her whole life and I've ruined another soul. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this even. Maybe a catharsis? A confirmation that I'm awful. I can't stop replaying all the horrible things I've done. My husband took a cute photo of her today and all I can think about is that she's sitting in a full diaper in the photo. I cry every time I look at it. ",

"Yeah idk. Me and my SO met on hinge 2 years ago. We kind of instantly hit it off and have been inseparable since. In fact we got engaged fairly quickly and shortly after our engagement I had a car accident leaving me unable to walk for almost 5 months. We also discovered we were pregnant. He was amazing the entire time and took care of me in ways that nobody should even have too until we’re old and sick. I will forever be grateful for him for that. 

Well our baby came in June. Everything has been great and we love him so much and our relationship has never been better honestly. Our sex life is phenomenal, our late night pillow talk is back to how it was when we were dating, we have date nights together and we text more because I’m home with the baby and he’s at work. 

I am and have been suffering for quite some time with PPA. It been a little better baby wise, was hoooorrrible for the first month or two, and has now switched to other things including self image issues and my need to try to look better. I’m at my highest weight ever and as a girl who used to be able to go get her hair, nails and lashes done whenever I’m now a mom with very minimal time for myself. It’s been really hard. I’ve also been trying to loose weight bc it will make me feel better over all to be healthier, especially with what trouble I’m having with the repercussions of my injuries, that loosing the weight will make and help me get around better as a mom. (Before pregnancy 185, before birth 260lbs, now 240lbs and still going) 

So lately I’ve been feeling insecure in my relationship even though everything seems good with us. A lot has happened to us in our timeframe but I know we do love each other a lot. When I think about him (prior to this all of a sudden insecurities) he makes me feel safe, loved, heard and cared for. We truly believe we’re soulmates and I wouldn’t want to do life without him. But..

The other day we took the baby to his work for a holiday thanksgiving party. He introduced me and the baby and slipped up and called me Beth. Well my middle name is Beth, but his ex girlfriend who cheated on him with his bf while they were cling togethers name is also Beth. He corrected himself super fast and seemed extremely embarrassed and I didn’t even say anything to him about it because we were at his job and I didn’t want to argue about something like that when we never argue. We always talk things out. But for some reason my PPA wouldn’t even let me bring it up. It was like if I shattered our perfect relationship with an argument about it or mentioned  it I was gonna loose my mind. 

Another thing, he’s been weird about my best-friend. She currently going through a break up with her baby daddy. We both love her son like our own as he spends a lot of time with us. He keeps jokingly saying after we spend the day with them that he’s been “thinking” and that he and his mother (my bff) should move in with us. He says it jokingly as if he just wants them to do that bc he loves her kid but the amount of times he brings it up is starting to bother me. He also said something recently like it’s fine ik you guys love each other y’all can get married to each other and I’ll just marry you. Like no I don’t want to live and be with just you and not another woman thanks! Even tho I know he’s kidding it rubs me the wrong way?? 

Idk outside of all of this like I said has been great. We want another baby, he doesn’t even want to wait lol, and we want to get on with our plans to get married. He really is my bestfriend. Our families are planing to spend the holidays together and I’m just upset w myself for not just speaking up and letting myself fester in this way. Idk why it’s happening and it’s very unlike me. I think I’d I brought both of these things up hed be kinda shocked? 

Idk I just need advice and someone to talk this through w who is unbiased. Maybe someone who understands or has also had PPA or anxiety. 

We were both in really long relationships before eachother. Not ones that were good either. His ex cheated like I said and mine might have as he ended up with one of my ex bestfriends as well, so I think that that might have to do something with how I’m feeling as well. My ex and my ex bff getting together was a shock early into my pregnancy and I know I prob shouldn’t have cared but I was just taken aback that they could do that after being friends (10 years) and my bf (8 years) for so long… I think that I really felt blindsided and thought I knew my ex better than that and it’s seeping into this relationship. Like am I really just that bad at knowing peoples trie intentions when two very prominent relationships of mine ended and then they ended up together. Idk

I feel sick lol. Someone help I feel crazy ",
"Hi so my daughter is now 7 months and she was a very colicky baby. The first few months I think I was in survival mode, just getting the basics done and lookign to the future for hope, but now it all came crashing down.  I think I’m depressed. 
I have lost interest in doing anything besides laying in bed or napping and even though I go out with my toddler and my baby, I still get home and feel so much emptiness and pointlessness. 

If not for my kids, I wouldn’t be here. 

Anyone have this only surfacing around the 6 month range or am I crazy? ",
"I have no one to talk to about this, I know I’m struggling. I cry myself to sleep every night. I see my baby and I want to hold on just a bit longer for him. 

I hate who I’ve became, I hate how I feel, how I look, how I act. Everything triggers me to become anxious and angry, I’m super type A and this has been so hard for me to just not be able to do much. I have a village that helps me but it’s never enough, I know they try but I feel like I never catch up on house work. I always snap at my husband and today he said, “You’d think because you’re not working it would be less stressful.” That sent me. 

I’m not good enough for anyone. My baby started teething and bites me while nursing so he doesn’t even need me anymore. I hate myself. I’m sorry but I just needed to vent. I love being a mom, I’ve always wanted this, I love my baby so much. I wish I could run away and have it just be me and him, I want to forget about all the problems in the world. God, give me strength to see another day. ",
"Any mothers who experienced PPD to the point where their babies developed developmental delays; were you able to get out of PPD and reconnect with your babies?

Did the developmental delays get noticeably better?

My baby didn't start speaking until he was 2 years old and I just want to know if nurturing him more will help. 

My grandma says I have to be stricter with him, but I don't feel like that's the right thing to do considering our situation.",
"My PPD struck me severely suddenly during the first week post partum, and I immediately received treatment and medication. I would say it took a whole 6 months for me to feel better and recover, then I was enjoying life again. I slowly weaned off my medications, and was doing ok for several months before the symptoms got re-triggered and now I’m back to having severe anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I just started back on my meds but slowly going to taper up over time. Has this happened to anyone before? I am feeling incredible shame and despair about this. ",
"The majority of the time, I would rather not be here. It's nothing personal to anybody, but I am not comfortable being this version of myself. They need better anyway.  ",
"Hi,

This question is mainly for the moms. Does anyone else feel uneasy at the idea of your children being left alone with male relatives. For whatever reason I don't feel comfortable with my son being left with alone with any of his 4 grandfather's. I'm constantly watching their every move. FYI I don't have a history of childhood trauma. I do however have postpartum anxiety/depression. 

Is this a common anxiety trigger?

"Im 32 years old. Im a ICU and emergency room nurse. On January 22 2024 I was 7 months pregnant, I had hyperemesis gravidarum and was struggling to work, constantly nauseous and throwing up 6 times a day. I could barely eat, and missed a lot of work hurting me financially. My baby stopped moving while I was at work. He was stillborn at my job 2 days later on 1/24/24. I was completely broken as a person after my son died. A part of me died in the delivery room with him that day. I was horrified and traumatized. My pregnancy had been healthy outside of the hyperemesis and baby had checked out totally fine on ultrasound and tests. I got pregnant again very quickly, about 6 weeks after my son was stillborn. This pregnancy I had hypermesis again. It was even worse. I was throwing up 20 times a day. I ended up on a continuous medication pump as well as IV fluids. I had to take unpaid medical leave from work. Thank god I had short time disability, it only pays at 60%. Once again I suffered financially. This time I was out of work for almost my entire pregnancy. I tried to go back to work at 25 weeks but was violently ill at work. Constantly in the bathroom throwing up and throwing up in patient rooms. My anxiety during this pregnancy was horrendous. I worried constantly that this baby would die too. I was so sick and depressed and isolated. All I could do was lay in bed, throw up and cry. My dogs took care of me while my partner worked overtime trying to help us financially. I lost my health insurance. We struggled to put food on the table. My baby was born early at 36 weeks last week. She is beautiful and perfect and alive and I’m so relieved. The hyperemesis went away as soon as she was born, I was so relieved. I got discharged from the hospital. First day was happy and joyful. The next morning my car was repossessed. The financial  struggles continue, I have no money. My savings are long gone. The depression hit along with the hormone drop. On day 3 I had nightmares so horrible. I dreamed about my son being born dead over and over. I dreamed my daughter was born dead too. I woke up screaming and crying. I’m still too afraid to sleep. I feel so overwhelmed and depressed. I have been thinking about suicide constantly. I did this while I was sick too. It’s just this constant thought, what a relief from all the financial hardship it would be. I feel so guilty for thinking this way. I should be grateful my rainbow baby is here safely, but I just feel so depressed and sad. I feel so crazy and anxious inside. I just want to feel like myself again. i need support. Please tell me everything will be ok. Please tell me I will survive this too. ",
"I was in a PHP (partial hospitalization program) and now am in an IOP (intensive outpatient program) for pretty severe PPD and PPA.  Thankfully my husband was able to take FMLA and stay home.  But his FMLA is running out and he is supposed to go back to work at the beginning of December.  It’s looking like I will still need to stay in the IOP beyond that - probably until the end of January.  Has anyone had to have their husband stay home beyond paternity leave/FMLA? I can’t stay in the IOP if he goes back to work because I don’t have anyone else that can watch our daughter.  I don’t think I’m ready to be done with the IOP because my depression and anxiety have finally stopped getting worse but I kind have just leveled out. I’m hoping things now start to improve, but I want to stay in the IOP to make sure that happens.  TIA for anyone who has any info they can share! ",
"There are a lot of threads on Zurzuvae but not a lot with research or updates, so hoping this thread can be more useful. I almost didn’t take the med because of threads I read and I am so glad I did. 

Background: 3 months pp with my second with terrible PPD. Lots of suicidal ideations. Crying constantly. Instant rage. History of depression and have been on Zoloft or Wellbutrin prior. 

TLDR: On day 12, worked at day 4 and has kept working. If you’re experiencing PPD/PPA I promise you aren’t the problem. Your brain is failing you. Reach out for help! 

What I learned before taking Zurzuvae: 

The biggest side effect is  somnolence but only 36% of people experienced this (in clinical trial). Other threads make it seem like it knocks everyone out. They did a study and found 9 hours after taking it’s as if your blood alcohol level is 0.05 (legal limit 0.08). It needs to be take with a high fat meal (24-50%) and 400-1000 calories because it is fat soluble. The normal dose is 50 mg, they did have some people drop down to 40 mg with similar affect. It costs about $16,000 without insurance, my insurance denied it at first but approved it after appealing and no cost to me. The original study the moms weren’t breastfeeding. There are a few tiny studies with breast feeding moms and the amount is breast milk is less than 1% weight adjusted, so like taking 0.5 mg dose for us and it doesn’t reach that level until day 5. We tried to learn when the drug peaks in my blood to reduce exposure but they say it’s between 3 and 16 hours so too broad to say. They observed no negative affects with breastfeeding. It is a synthetic 

Side Effects (% of patients in trials): somnolence (36), dizziness (13), diarrhea (6), fatigue (5), UTI (5), memory impairment ( 3), abdominal pain (3), tremor (2), hypoesthesia (2), muscle twitch (2), myalgia/muscle pain (2) 

Side Effects I experienced: dizziness, memory impairment, muscle twitch 

Started Zurzuvae 50mg and here is my day by day breakdown:

Day 1: Took at 7pm (once kids were asleep) with high fat meal. Pretty shortly after felt drunkish or just off. I was worried I may not wake up overnight but did without any issues and was able to take care of the baby. 

Day 2: woke up and felt pretty normal all day. Still depressed. Took second dose at 5:30 pm since it didn’t knock me out like I expected. 

Day 3: Extreme depression (maybe from coming off Wellbutrin) and felt really off. Didn’t feel like I could safely drive all day. Talked to my doctor and discussed dropping to 25 mg but worried it wouldn’t be as effective due to limit data, so tried 50 mg again at 5:30pm. 

Day 4: woke up with energy (despite terrible newborn sleep) and didn’t feel depressed at all. No thoughts of wanting to kill myself. Able to handle unpredictability without crying. 

Day 5: tired but not depressed. I did stay up about 3 hours after taking it and had insomnia which I have seen others report. But Kids having meltdowns and I felt able to handle it. Actually handled the chaos better than my husband for once. All the side effects have gone away despite an occasional headache. 

Day 6-11: no depression or anxiety. I’m the happiest I have been since before my first was born 2 years ago. Have been taking everyday at 5:30 pm. 

Day 12: having moments where I feel like my depression is coming back but not certain. Very dizzy. Difficulties functioning during the day. 

Day 13: depression is back, so sad, and crying a lot. Hoping this is just a temporary swing. Dizziness and weakness again. Very tough day. I didn’t take my last dose bc I couldn’t handle another day of the side effects. 

Day 14: first 24 hours without meds. Feeling much better! Not as good as day 4. It seems like some rebound depression or mood swings are normal while brain rewires. 

Day 14-21: off zurzuvae. Definitely still battling some depression but the intensity is soo much better. I had depression before pregnancy so wondering if Surzuvae fixed dangerous postpartum depression and now I’m just battling normal depression. Started low dose Zoloft. Feel free to message me with questions. ",
"Hello everyone. Just coming on here hoping this is a safe space.. My daughter is 11 months old and I have basically been alone with her since day 1. Her father lives out of the country so it's just her and I. I haven't gotten a good nights rest since she was born. At 11 months she still wakes up multiple times a night and I've literally tried everything and nothing seems to work. I have other mom friends whose kids have slept through the night by like 5 months old. Sleep deprivation is taking over me and not sure if that's causing my post partum rage. I become so angry with my daughter in ways I've never felt before, especially at night. At night time I often think of hurting her which leads to thoughts of me hurting myself. I would never actually hurt her but I hate that the thought even crosses my mind. during the day I become irritated so quickly because she's such an active baby and literally will not stop touching/climbing me or biting me, pulling my hair, pinching me, etc. I feel that if I had more help, I would be a better mom. I have no breaks, no self care, nothing for me. And I know being a mom makes you sacrifice a lot of these things but I feel like I've lost myself completely. I'm so painfully exhausted. there's not a morning I don't wake up and tears just flow down my face and the thoughts of not being here anymore just take over. 

This is probably a bunch of word garbage but I had to put my feelings out somewhere. ",
"Long post : TLDR am I beyond help? 

This morning I completely lost it with my 11mo. I literally scream shouted at him ""get out of the way"" because he was constantly under my feet when trying to clean the house. My husband came and grabbed him and the three of them went in another room. 

I have a 2yo LG abs a 11mo LB. He's the sweetest baby most of the time but very clingy and whiny, my first was clingy but nowhere near as whiny. I hate to say it but it literally makes me so angry and overwhelmed when he's whinging and climbing on me of following me around. 

I've suffered with my temper as well as depression and anxiety since being a small child and have had lots of therapy and meds in adolescence and adulthood. I get SO overwhelmed so quickly and easily. Now with two small children I am constantly on the edge. Always touched out and overstimulated. 

I feel so fucking awful. I've never screamed like that with ny little girl but I've got such a short fuse when it comes to my boy. I feel so ashamed and awful. Usually I can leave him in a safe place and go and calm down but today I lost it. I'm disgusted at myself. How can I shout at a baby?! I feel like the worst mum in the world. 

I've done SO much therapy since his birth, been under the perinatal mental health team, my GP, has various med prescribed, done parenting courses, done baby classes to help us bond. .. even after all this work I'm still so quick to anger. 

My kid deserve so much better and I genuinely don't know what else to do to change. I love them both so much and I grew up in a violent chaotic household so really don't want them to have the same volatile environment. 

My husband is so supportive and a great dad. I just get so overwhelmed with the mental load and being the default parent at times. It makes me wonder if I'm cut out for this at all? Would they all be better off without me? 

What am I missing? How do I make myself be a better mum?",
"Two under two, baby #1 is so good, she’s too good to be true. Perfect baby. Baby #2 at just 10 months he is already a problem. I can feel it sometimes he doesn’t like me. I sense it. Has anyone gone through this or am I just going MADD!?  

I’m convinced after He cried with a high pitch cry for 40 minutes STRAIGHT!!!! I did my best to try to calm him down, NOTHING worked. As soon as I woke my husband up for help, he took him and that baby boy just stopped crying and screaming. He really just pissed me off. What is this that I’m facing ? Can your own baby dislike you? ",
"Is it normal to have swelling / tingling in legs after pregnancy? Baby got here two days ago and she’s freaking out because her legs are swollen and tight and she says they are tingling. 

Everything we see on Google says it’s normal but anyone else have this experience? ",
"I just have to get this out here because I don't think people really know or can understand what I went through. 

I gave birth in 2020 and experienced a good 3 months with my baby. I had crying spells due to a broken family. My mom died suddenly in a car crash in 2018 and I guess my family just couldn't love me the same.

I was basically alone with a newborn, which was fine until it wasn't.

I stopped breastfeeding at about month 5, cold turkey. I did not wean my baby off like I should have. I didn't have any experience and I didn't have the support around me to help me to understand what and how I should have done things.

At about month 6, I started to feel completely disconnected to my baby. I didn't know what was happening. I eventually tried reaching out to my aunt for help, but she wasn't talking to me. I kept to a routine where I fed him and bathed him. But I didn't really interact with him, which was different from the months I had breastfed him. I felt like we were two peas in a pod then all of the sudden I couldn't hold him without feeling tired, and I didn't want to be tired.

I kept him in one of those baby gardens, like a giant pack and play, with all of his toys cause I was deathly afraid that he would severely hurt himself.

I had known about ppd, but I thought that it was like general depression and I had been depressed before but this was completely different. I was hallucinating, at one point my baby started to talk to me, my 5 month old baby answered questions with a yes and a no. I thought he was possessed.

Don't get me wrong I was scared at first. I went to the kitchen, placed him in his bouncers and just started sobbing, wailing, praying for God to give me back my baby. My baby looked at me with pity at one point in the night.

Eventually, this passed and he returned to what I think was his normal. But every so often he would look at me with this smug smile, like he was better than me.

I figured I was just going crazy on top of not being able to be the mother I wanted to be with him. But I still loved him with all of my heart regardless of what he looked like to me.

Fast forward to almost his 2nd birthday, I was being evicted from our house. I had made plans to go to a university 1.5 hours away and was looking for housing in that town. I couldn't hold a job because I couldn't stop crying while I was working. I constantly thought that I had somehow killed my baby, that either his death or my death was coming. 

I heard voices in my head that sounded like my family. I didnt want to hear from the family that shunned me, I thought they were all mad at me and was constantly confused and scared when I would hear them.

I visited family and told them that I was getting evicted but all I got was, you can't live with us. My estranged dad's wife asked me, while we were driving back from shopping, to their house, with her teenage daughter in the car ""Why don't you come to college in the town we live in?"" But since they didn't ask me to live with them, I didn't know that she was asking me to live with them. I said ""No"" as I had already registered to go to a college. Later, I found out this was supposed to be a formal offer to live with them...

So, I went back to the house I was getting evicted from and looked for housing in the college town. I thought I had found a good prospect and had borrowed $2500 from my grandma for the down payment and first months rent. It turned out to be a scam. So, I went to the college town with my child and thought I could book a hotel and look for housing around there. I ended up not being able to find housing, so I thought I could stay at an extended stay hotel. 

When I went to the extended stay hotel to confirm our room for the month, a cop car pulled up and brought someone from the hotel down in cuffs, so I canceled my reservation and started looking elsewhere. 

I ended up booking an Airbnb for a week, which took $1200 out of the money I had for housing.

While staying at the Airbnb, my neighbor told me that the owner of the house I was being evicted from started taking all of my stuff out of the house. 

I was super overwhelmed, so I stayed in the college town while all of my memories, clothes, and furniture got stolen or taken to the dump. My neighbor said that they had put a tarp on my stuff, but I didn't have the means or the mindset to move all of my stuff and take it to storage by myself. I didn't even reach out for help then as I had asked for it multiple times and had been denied. 

At this point, I had lost everything and barely had a penny to my name. I called my best friend's mom who had helped us move in to our house. I asked for money, but I didn't tell her what was going on. I could barely think straight. She said she would think about it. I called my best friend in a panic, it was a couple nights before her wedding and she told me her mom said no.

I stayed in the Airbnb until the last day. The cleaning lady came and I had it in my mind that they wouldn't throw out a single mother who had lost everything, really I was thinking that the house I was staying in was owned by my best friend's mom, who owns property over 600 miles away...

The cleaning lady came and I wouldn't let her in, stating ""I'll clean the house ""

Eventually the cops came and kicked us out. I didn't want to get arrested so I grabbed my baby and started walking down the street in our pajamas. 

When the cops left I went back, as my car was in the driveway of the Airbnb.

I got in the car and started driving, not knowing what I was going to do.

I called my grandma trying to get help, but she didn't answer. 

Eventually I came to the towns airport. My ex was an airplane mechanic who lived 600 miles away. I thought he was going to randomly show up at this airport that we had stopped at.

I took my baby to the bathroom to change his diaper. When I realized he didn't have diapers in his diaper bag, I broke. No one was at this part of the the airport, it was like for private customers, the only person there was a janitor.

Me and the janitor locked eyes, then I left to go to the car without my baby. I left him with the janitor.

I drove back to the Airbnb and called the cops, saying ""I lost my baby at the airport."" 

The cops came to the Airbnb and arrested me. 

My baby was taken into DCS custody and I was taken to jail. 

This is also what PPD looks like.

I’m a 29-year-old first-time mom, and this past year has been the hardest of my life. My first pregnancy was high-risk, and I went through it alone because my child’s father didn’t want to be involved. Despite almost losing my baby, by the grace of God, he made it out healthy.

But just four days after giving birth (four weeks early), I lost my grandmother, who I was extremely close to—right before my birthday. Then, only two days later, I lost my brother to a blood clot in his lungs.

The grief and stress have been unbearable. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum anxiety (PPA). I started on Zoloft, but the side effects made things worse, and my doctor switched me to Lexapro. Now, I feel trapped in my own body.

It feels like no one cares—my job, my friends, even my family. I’m at a breaking point. I don’t know how to keep going, and I feel so alone in all of this.

I just want my son to be loved and cared for, but I feel like I’m failing him. I’m desperate for advice, encouragement, or just someone to remind me that things can get better.

",
Apparently there are clinically proven cases it works and cures the disease not masks like antidepressants do. Thoughts? Haven’t tried anything myself. ,
"I’m drowning. I have 2 under 2. My daughter turns 2 soon and my son is almost 8 months. He was born early and I feel like his birth traumatized me. 

I feel like I’m definitely dealing with postpartum rage and PPD. My husband is mad at me for having our son but he was the one who knocked me up with both of the kids. He has a “high libido” and always wants it every day. I’m exhausted from taking care of the kids all day. I can’t do it every day. 

He gets so frustrated at me and said that all I’m good for is having babies and being angry all of the time. But he has major anger issues. And believes that a small apology will make me move on. He says that I hold on to things but he holds on to things as well. He just believes he is oh so different from I am. 

Today is our anniversary and I was supposed to be making a cake and surprising him with it. But why should I when I’m good for nothing but breeding in his eyes?

My mother passed away. My ILs suck. My father was always away working during my formative years and my older sister even told us that he didn’t even want me and my little brother. Just her and my older brother. And now I feel like I married a guy who is just like my dad. And that feeling SUCKS. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",
"Hi all. 

I did not have a great start to breastfeeding as I didn’t get a session with the lactation consultant before leaving the hospital. We were re-admitted at 48 hours old due to jaundice and baby losing 13% of his body weight. I pumped and fed around the clock (they actually wanted me to try breastfeeding on top of that but it was too much). 

Saw LC multiple times at the hospital and a clinical setting and whenever I tried to feed (with nipple shields can’t BF without them) it would be frustrating because he wouldn’t be getting enough, he was hurting me even with the nipple shields and I still had to bottle feed after.

I think this gave me an aversion to nursing because I no longer feel like I want to or want to be the sole food source for baby and I’m enjoying having others help me when I need a break or nap. 

I’ve been pumping occasionally throughout the day but the milk only amounts to a couple feeds during the day. I hate the feeling of engorgement and I’m not producing that much (probably because I don’t pump that frequently). I totally can’t pump every 3 hours like the recommendation and now I’m up with baby in the morning, feeling engorged and the pain and swelling is really bothering me and making me upset. 

I don’t think this classifies as DMER and while I haven’t gotten a formal diagnosis for any postpartum mental health condition but wondering if anyone else really doesn’t desire to breastfeed like me when I feel like everyone I talk or posts something online talks about how much they want to breastfeed and how hard they’re working to increase supply when I really don’t feel like I want to or have the energy. I also miss my pre-pregnancy/breastfeeding boobs a lot and I think the body image aspect has a big effect on my postpartum experience. Overall feeling low and heavily relying on others around me for help when I can. ",
"Just a little something I ended up writing at midnight, and I thought this was a place where I could share it without being judged.



The room was cold, the lights too bright,  
I had dreamed of calm, of a softer night.  
I’d planned to breathe, to feel her near,  
But things unraveled, sharp and clear.

They said it was time, no words to spare,  
An urgent need, they cut with care.  
The dream of natural washed away,  
As I watched my hopes dissolve that day.

No one asked, no one knew,  
The battle inside that no one could view.  
I tried to hold on, tried to be strong,  
But everything felt deeply wrong.

My body failed, or so I thought,  
A scar remained where I had fought.  
She’s here, she’s healthy, perfect, and small,  
Yet I still feel like I lost it all.

The shame seeps in like a quiet storm,  
How can I feel distant from a life I’ve borne?  
Her tiny hands, her newborn cries,  
Yet something inside me silently dies.

I didn’t talk, didn’t share,  
The guilt inside is too much to bear.  
Everyone smiles, says she’s a dream,  
But they don’t see my silent scream.

I love her deeply, more than words can say,  
But why does my heart still feel this way?  
There’s a distance I can’t explain,  
A fragile bond wrapped in pain.

They tell me I’m lucky, she’s safe, she’s here,  
But my mind is clouded by fear.  
Did I fail her? Am I enough?  
This journey, it’s been far too rough.

Her eyes meet mine, they’re bright and new,  
And sometimes, I can almost feel it too—  
That connection I thought would be,  
But then the guilt washes over me.

I’m scared of this feeling I can’t shake,  
That I’ve somehow made a mistake.  
I carried her close, through all the strain,  
So why does it feel like I’m lost again?

I should feel proud, relieved, at peace,  
But the fear and guilt, they never cease.  
She’s here, she’s healthy, my baby girl,  
Yet my heart is heavy in this broken world.

Maybe, one day, I’ll feel whole inside,  
The shame and fear will finally subside.

I just want to know if this is normal or if I am severely dropping the ball. I'm 6 months post partum and I just can't keep the house tidy like I used to. Il admit things are messy. My bub cries a lot and she doesn't like being put down. I still try and do dinner every night, vacuum, do some washing, but sometimes I can't find the time to do the dishes, and my hair is falling out so it's everywhere. This seems to absolutely infuriate my husband. He comes in and angrily does the dishes, or puts the laundry out, and says I'm grotty. He thinks I should just clean as I go. I try and explain that sometimes I can only manage one part of a chore before baby needs me. My baby contact naps a lot. On the rare occasion he sleeps in his crib, I do lie down and scroll. He thinks this is lazy. Is this normal? I feel bad that the house isn't tidy anymore. Should I have it together by now? I'll add that my husband doesn't do any settling, he believes these are my duties because he works. I'm not trying to get out of it but am I being unreasonable to ask for him to Do the occasional settle? I really don't know if I'm being selfish or not. Any insights would be appreciated",
"I'm 6 months postpartum with my second child. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts for most of my life and I'm at my breaking point. I feel so guilty for wanting to leave my children and husband, but I don't know who to talk to. I want my family and friends to think im okay. I don't want to share how I feel with anyone who knows me. Anyone dealt with suicidal thoughts while postpartum. How did you cope? Anyone know someone who committed suicide during postpartum? I feel so empty.",
"i’m a middle child in the family, and so i’ve never been the one to leave a lasting impression on extended family. i’m the one hardly anyone asks about or i’m usually the last thought when it comes to family. this is why i don’t value family of origin. 

now, i have a baby and STILL no one notices the mother, only wants to see and hold the baby while i’m gone at work. and i get judged because “i’m being stingy” with my own child. my extended family are complete strangers to me. i only know my immediate family. i would never willingly let a stranger hold my child.

i’m struggling a lot mentally. i’m a single mother who’s baby father is in jail. depending on my narcissistic family. in a completely different cultural environment, 300 miles away from my hometown. working a full time job. and coming home to a baby. i’m highly stressed. i have no friends. i don’t know how i haven’t exploded yet. but i feel restless. i feel something is wrong with my mental health. i cannot focus anymore. my memory is short. im always in a dream state. im so freaking TIRED.",
"Been having the worst insomnia of my life. Up at midnight and then can't go back to sleep the rest of the night. In those moments, have overwhelming feelings of anxiety, rage and depression. Reached out to my OB for sleep medication and I was told merely to take melatonin. Tried to find a primary care provider and was told there are no appointments for new clients until next summer. Joined Talkspace to do online therapy. Matched with 3-4 therapists and got so little help - a few handouts and links to Youtube videos. Finally matched with a therapist who seemed promising and we met for a video session. The video session was horrible, he was asking me odd questions and talking about his kids the whole time. I was bouncing my baby during the call trying to keep her quiet as he rambled. The session ran over time, and I tried to end the call but he kept talking. After the call, I feel even more discouraged like there's no help available. My husband and I have finally come up with a plan to have him help with night feedings, but baby refuses a bottle at least half the time. I'm just so done.",
"I gave birth to the most beautiful baby boy two months ago. Postpartum depression is rough. I feel like my husband doesn’t give a shit about how bad I’m struggling. I don’t know if it’s the PPD, but I thought he’d make a better dad than he has been so far. I worry it’s making me fall out of love with him. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it possible to go back to being in love with your spouse if so? ",
"I am on 6 weeks PP, my baby is still in NICU since 2nd Oct came at 27 week.. lost twin B. 
It has been a weird phase i was sad these entire weeks just crying all day while trying to pump 8 times a day and spending time in the NICU with lots of ups and downs. 

I feel angry! ALL THE TIME. Specifically towards my husband, he has taken days off from work since i gave birth and his existence now irritates me. He says he took it to be with me and help, but sleeping all day! And if not then spending his time and money fixing his car in the garage. Or go hang with him cousins. 

I feel alone, he says i can spend time with you but i don’t want to ask! It’s a given and i usually communicate really good our relationship never had any issues. But now i cannot stand it i am pissed. 

I am going to therapy already, eating healthy, starting to work out a little i hate how my body looks after gaining 20 kilos! And only losing 5 since birth i do not recognise myself.. 

Everything feels like i am stuck in limbo with a really huge rage. I miss smoking or having a glass here and there. I cannot even enjoy these little things as i am pumping for my NICU baby which he is sensitive to my breast milk and the doctors stopped it, but still wanting me to continue my supply for later on. 

Nothing is going right for me i feel.. i am sad and tired. ",
"11weeks pp, FTM. I just needed to rant. Does it ever get easier??????? After countless of breakdowns and fights with my partner over my rage, i’m just here hoping I get to die soon. Maybe then it’ll all get easier, maybe then everyone will realize how much i’ve been doing and dealing with.

I’m not suicidal, there are just times that I fantasize being unalived like maybe running into traffic, jumping off my balcony, rolling out of a moving car. i just have these thoughts randomly throughout the day. Then I will break down because baby girl has been nothing but sweet. She’s so so lovely and i’m just so sorry that she has me as her mom. Why is this the single hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do? Everyone paints motherhood as this beautiful journey and I feel mine has been nothing but that. 

I’m also starting work in less than a month now and I really cannot imagine coping with all this while working. Would I still struggle this way when baby girl turns 1? When does all these feeling and struggles go away? Will it ever? ",
"Does anyone have any advice on how to get through the really hard days? Today is one of those days where nothing makes sense, I feel hopeless and like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. I’m 7 months PP, already on medication and have accessed therapy. Even then, some days are just hard. Postpartum depression sucks. It feels different than anything I’ve ever felt before, and some days it just feels so big and endless. ",
"I’m going to be 5 months pp in 2 weeks. I gained about 15kgs by the last month of pregnancy and lost 10 right after giving birth. However, as I started breastfeeding and my supply established I gained all the weight back. I’ve been eating almost the same except for adding 2 eggs to my diet for protein. 

I was very fit pre pregnancy and lifting pretty heavy and doing HIIT regularly. Unfortunately I had to stop working out at 20weeks pregnant due to a hematoma. And now I feel like I’ve lost everything I spent years building. I’m not able to do pushups, one round  of HIIT makes me feel like I’m going to die. Clothes don’t fit the same. My boobs are much bigger and so is my butt(not in a nice way). And the weight just won’t budge.
I miss how I used to be and I just miss feeling healthy and like I can do anything. Now I just feel exhausted and my body starts hurting when I exert myself. My body feels foreign to me at this point. It makes me wonder if this is how it’s going to be forever and I’m having a hard time accepting it. 

I’ve heard moms say you lose weight once you wean off breastfeeding. That’s going to take me another 6 months. My periods are back but very very erratic. Will I never get my body and health back? I already feel like an afterthought and like I’ve lost my sense of self since having the baby. Now, this inability to effectively perform any physical activity and the way my body is failing me (feels like that) is just making me feel even more depressed. ",
"I'm 19 with a 4 month old baby. I moved in with my boyfriend (now ex) at 18 after only a few months of dating him. I got pregnant right after. Very long story short, the relationship was extremely toxic after that. He didn't want our baby and blamed me for it. He was very controlling and wouldn't let me get a job because he didn't trust me around other guys. He lost his job, though, and refused to get another. So we struggled for food and eventually lost our apartment. I finally ate my pride and just moved back in with my mom. We broke up a few days after I had a 28 hour induced labor for preeclampsia and then a c-section with semi-failed anesthesia, which I also hemorrhaged during. Right now I, embarrassingly, rely on my parents. I'm struggling to get childcare so I can go back to work since nobody can watch my child for long enough. I'm struggling to get a license because nobody has time to teach me. I have one friend who lives states away from me. I am not in the right living situation to be comfortable dating again. My ex does not help provide for my son, but since birth he decided he wants to be a father and see him. I let him visit when possible but I refuse to let him take our son anywhere. 

I know another girl who works with my mom. She's my age and bought a house recently. Met a man a bit ago and moved in together after a month of dating. They're expecting a child now. I also found out that my ex is in a new relationship.

The point of this post is just to vent about how jealous I am. I am very happy for my mom's coworker. She seems very happy. But I'd be lying if I said that it doesn't hurt me to see her living the life that I wanted so badly. Why is it that she gets to be happy bringing her first child into the world but I didn't? Why does my ex get to brag about how happy he is with his new woman to me when I'm struggling to take care of his child? I'm not trying to say that all those mothers with happy relationships and their own homes don't have issues, because I understand that they do, but I just wish I could live some of their life. I want my own home. I want to be in a happy and healthy relationship. But now I don't know if I'll ever be able to even trust another man because my ex hurt me so badly. I just want to know how it feels to be a first time mother and actually feel happy during it (I love my baby more than anything, obviously, just the situation I was in made it hard to be happy). I'll never be able to experience being a new mother again.",
"Not sure if this is the best place for this, but I am a 7 days postpartum FTM and I absolutely dread night time and count the hours until the next day. The minute the sun sets I become so anxious and sad. Possibly anxious about what’s to come overnight, but just not sure if it’s normal to feel largely fine during the day and like a different person at night. ",

5 weeks pp

Just got my first period . I’m extremely tired , angry & I go back to work in 2 weeks. How do I balance work life , mom life of 2 children and being a wife . 

Sometimes I just want to walk away from everything and start a new life without a family ",
"Hey everyone,

Dad of 2 kids. Most of my friends don't have kids so I’m reaching out here because I start to struggle to keep things together, and I’m hoping some of you may have advice or words of encouragement to share.

My wife recently started experiencing a sudden onset of tinnitus, and it's been a nightmare for her. We’re about 3 months postpartum with our second child, and she’s barely able to get any sleep because of this relentless ringing in her ears. This is all so unexpected. When we had our first, she never had to worry about getting up at night; I took over all the nighttime feedings to help her body and mind recover. It worked well that time around, and we figured the same approach would help us get through this second postpartum phase.

But now, the tinnitus has changed everything. My wife is absolutely exhausted—physically and emotionally. She’s at a breaking point and spends a lot of time crying and hiding away in the bathroom. She's been passing out majority of the days from sheer exhaustion. She’s in such a rough place, and it’s heartbreaking to watch her go through this without being able to make it better. It's also hard in Canada to get access to medical professionals or have them to take you seriously when the symptoms are not life threatening to them.  

Our 2.5-year-old is extremely attached to me because I have been her primary caregiver since birth, so balancing time with them while also caring for the baby is a huge challenge. I recently returned to work from paternity leave and am working from home, but I’m caught between meetings and taking care of the baby. It’s constant juggling, and it feels like I can’t catch a break or truly be present for either kid.

If anyone has experienced postpartum tinnitus or has suggestions on how to get through this rough patch, please let me know. And if nothing else, please send good vibes our way. We could use them right now.

Thanks for listening.",
I’ve been struggling to figure out how to tell my husband I have post partum depression. I am a SAHM who’s 9 months PP and am isolated but still see family and friends often. My husband is a god send and does a lot for me so I feel embarrassed that I feel like I have it. I also am pregnant again so I’m sure that doesn’t help but idk what to do the only family I really see on my side is my dad and my step mom(who doesn’t have her own kids) so I don’t talk to them about it. Please help me Ik I need help but can’t bring myself to ask for it.,
"My daughter is almost 7 months old and during pregnancy and until she was 5-6 months I was in a good place mentally, very relaxed and happy (besides the fatigue and a few tears from the sleep deprivation, since a few weeks she is waking me up only 2-3x a night in stead of 2-5x).

Since a few weeks though I've been feeling low on mental energy and down. I am easily irritated. Yesterday I looked at my daughter and didn't feel much. I felt like I wanted to get rid of her. Today this is going better, I am enjoying my time with her more but I am still low energy and down.
Is this a combination of 7 months of sleep deprivation and the start of the fall or could this still be PPD?
(I've always been sensitive to depression and anxiety and have been taking 50mg of Zoloft for 12 years now which saved my life at the time).

(I am still breastfeeding btw and my cycle hasn't started yet)",
I'm 6 months PP and I've got pre-existing mental health conditions.   They ALL flared up around the 5 month mark and I'm trying all sorts of medications and nothing is giving me relief.  Taking it day by day right now.   I just miss enjoying taking care of my baby.   That baby is my whole world.    Mama's so tired and is fighting so hard.   ,
"before i had my son i already struggled with depression, but for the first few months everything felt much lighter. after multiple pregnancy losses i finally had a baby of my own. i was so proud of myself because my drinking was under control and I hadn’t had thoughts of s/h in nearly a year. now he’s nearly 6 months and it’s all changing. 
it felt like just him and me against the world but now i can’t even find the energy to play with him. he always wants his dad who didn’t want him to begin with but now they’re best friends. he doesn’t smile at me as much as he used to. he cries more. i know it’s not rational to think that he loves me less and that his dad has replaced me but i can’t get the thought out of my head.
i’ve started drinking every day again, my insomnia is back, i’m argumentative, i keep reliving horrific memories, and i keep having this awful thought that i should end it while he’s still too young to remember me. i don’t think me meds are working anymore and i need help.
med management has proven pretty much impossible to access where i’m at and i can’t check myself in anywhere without losing my job. not that my job pays enough for me to survive anyway but $400 a month is better than nothing.
i don’t know what to do. i feel like a failure as a parent. how can i give my son the healthy childhood i never had if i keep unraveling?",
"I’m 11 weeks PP and I thought I was starting to feel better about things, but lately everything just feels like so much… I feel like I’m trying to juggle everything at once. Things seem to be getting tense between my husband and I. Living with my parents feels like a blessing and a curse because my parents do help but I feel like my father has been down my neck and judging everything me and my husband do. I feel like I’ve been struggling to find myself again and like no matter what I’m just meant to be miserable.. At this point I’m just scared my life is going to start crumbling on itself.. ",
"I have always been depressed about myself. Since having my baby, I do not feel the same as I did before. I do not have any thoughts about hurting him, rather I have thoughts of horrible things happening when we’re on walks, or at night when I accidentally fall asleep with him on me.

My irritability and lack of desire in intimacy are the worst symptoms, not sure if it’s hormones or if I’m just a major bitch. I cannot stand my husband. He is a great dad, and does a lot of things around the house. But I can’t help but get upset and angry over little things and lash out at him by yelling. 

And when he touches me, while I’m breastfeeding or afterwards— I lash out physically without even thinking about it. I have told him many times I do not like to be touched because I’m completely touched out by the breastfeeding but he keeps wanting to initiate intimacy. 

Not sure if this has any effect, but I also just had the Kyleena IUD inserted for birth control.

I feel horrible for this and have confided in my husband that I presume I may have PPD. Should I get meds? The irritability has gotten to be too much.

"Today is so incredibly hard. I woke up this morning feeling so anxious before I even got out of bed. I needed to go to the grocery store this morning and also find some time to get in some work for my job. Now that I’ve had this realization that this life isn’t all what I want, my soul aches more than ever to be free.

I have dreams of leaving everything behind and getting on the next plane to a tropical paradise. I would have my daughter with me, and we would arrive and find a nice little outdoor restaurant to get some food. We would meet some of the local people and ask for their recommendations on nice places to sleep that night, and we would figure out the rest from there. No more bills, no more job, no more appointments or grocery shopping, no more chores. No more people to answer to or responsibilities of taking care of a house, possessions, and relationships that I don’t even want and don’t even serve me. Just nothing but freedom to go anywhere I wanted, do anything I wanted, and show my daughter the world.

In his book “Instructions for a New Life,” Markus Rothkranz talks about how all of this is possible. The only issue is that it’s much easier when you don’t have a child and have to get consent from another parent to take the child with you. I mourn that I didn’t have this realization when I was still single and completely unencumbered - if I could go back, I would give away all of my possessions and be on the next plane. I know I will figure it out and I will be free, but I now hate and resent having to wait. 

I had originally planned to make my move after the holidays, but I’m not so sure now. If the rest of my days are anything like today, I don’t think my mental health can take it, which is my top priority for not only myself, but my daughter’s sake. She needs me to be at my best for her, and I’m so committed now than ever to make that happen for her.

So we’ll see if I’m able to wait another six whole weeks or not. I feel a strong surging in my spirit that something may have to happen before then, and maybe it will be the crazy leap of faith that I’m needing to finally catapult my life in the direction it was meant to go.",
"So I'm a young-ish mum, I'm 20 and have a 6 month old baby girl. 
I've been struggling with PPD and PPA since giving birth, I've been diagnosed by a professional yet still the only ones who seem to take me seriously on that are my mum and husband. 
I have a traumatic birth, so much so that just going near hospitals will now trigger panic attacks.

[Birth Experience]
I had to have an induced labour as my daughter was overdue by 4 days, however just minutes after my induction I went into labour. The night nurses were insistent that I wasn't in labour as they not long started the induction and it was just normal contractions, that I wouldn't recognise labour as I was a first time mom. I was left on the ward by myself for hours, screaming in pain, eventually I started noticing there was severe blood loss and since no one was answering the call button by my bed I had to try walk to their office, resulting in my collapsing on the floor from exhaustion. Still the night nurses wouldn't take me seriously, calling me dramatic and yelling at me to stop crying. 
3 hours later the day nurse, bless her heart, came in for her shift and rushed in to check on me after hearing me screaming for help. My daughter was crowning then and since I had been in active labour for over 7 hours by this point I was exhausted and couldn't push her out. I was put onto a wheelchair, and pushed down a freezing cold corridor to the delivery ward where I was told I couldn't have a c-section as she was already coming out, however I also couldn't have ant painkillers as I had to focus on pushing my daughter out. By some miracle I managed to push her out, but I don't recall anything after that until the next morning as I had fallen unconscious from the blood loss and my heart had momentarily stopped. 
I had my friend and partner in the room with me and they said that the room went deathly silent after the heart monitor showed I had no pulse and then multiple midwives rushed in and began doing CPR and using defibrillators. Meanwhile another midwife was handling my daughter who had been born with her cord wrapped around her neck and wasn't breathing. 
I'm forever grateful to the midwife who saved my daughter, and the midwives who saved me. 
After being sent home to recover my husband and mum urged me to report the night staff for medical negligence but after months of trying to get justice for what happened to me and my daughter the hospital still didn't take me seriously, blaming the situation on me claiming that I should've been more assertive. 

My family are all aware of this but the frequently blame me saying that it was my fault for having a baby at such a young age anyway, and that I should've had an abortion. My husband and I always wanted to start a family and were delighted when we found out I was pregnant, and we followed the pregnancy through as there was 0 complications, both me and my baby were incredibly healthy. 
Despite them all blaming it on me, they are still pushing me and husband to try for another baby so my daughter has a playmate, not caring about the trauma childbirth has put me through. 

I really don't know what to do anymore, I love my daughter so much but sometimes I just feel miserable, unable to motivate myself to do anything. I'm lucky to have my husband here really as he is a big help but even still we struggle, some days I'm fine and able to go out and do fun things, but most days it feels like I'm just stuck in a void. 
I've tried going to therapy to help but the therapists I've been to were horrible, eventually saying that they couldn't have me as a client as they found me intolerable as it was my fault the entire experience happened to begin with.
I'm running out of ways to cope, and I'm scared of losing my daughter because of this.

"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with pp anxiety a year ago... started taking Zoloft at 50mg since. I've always suffered with bad intrusive thoughts but I felt like Zoloft was helping me manage it better. I’m desperate to know if anyone else gets thoughts while in the moment that tell you that you are doing something inappropriately? I feel so alone and I’m shutting down completely. Is this a form of intrusive thoughts that make you think you are acting on it at the moment? Anybody relate? My 3 year old daughter loves to take her shirt off and copy her 20 month old brother, so we were getting ready to leave and before I dressed her I was gonna do her hair. But as I picked her up off the couch to place her in the chair, my mind instantly said you're touching her inappropriately so I moved my hand and now I'm thinking I like touched her by her nipple inappropriately. I just feel like a terrible mom. I know when you pick kids up you don't mean to touch them in that area but you do because you're picking them up under their arms. Idk why I'm feeling like I did something inappropriate or intentional but my anxiety has skyrocketed and it's making me feel depressed and sad.

Can anyone relate to this as a mom? I am feeling hopeless and I have a therapy appt tomorrow… but I feel alone",

Since having our 2 month old he has gone on one trip already and just left for another today. I can’t sleep when he’s gone because I get so much anxiety and intrusive thoughts that it keeps me up. I won’t get into details about the intrusive thoughts so I don’t plant any in others heads… that’s how I picked up on some of my greatest fears- from other people. If I do fall asleep, I wake up in a panic attack. I tell myself it’s not real, my thoughts are not me, and it’s not going to happen. I’m in therapy and on medication, but I swear it’s like it doesn’t help when he leaves on work trips. I feel like I can’t tell him because these trips are essential to his career so I don’t want to make him worry. I’m exhausted already and it hasn’t been a full day that he’s been gone.

My husband and I flew from southern CA to stay there as their unit specializes in postpartum mood disorders. 

If anyone is suffering and you have the ability to - I highly recommend going inpatient at a facility like this. I believe there are only 2-3 in the U.S. that specialize in PPD. ",
I go back to work this week from maternity leave. I'm absolutely dreading it. Like feel physically sick. It doesn't help that I accidentally read a horror story of a baby the same age as mine that just passed away. I'm also feeling really sad because my LO was a twin but we unfortunately lost their sibling in the first trimester. (We also had a MC in 2022) I feel like I failed my LO. I feel like he is missing out on having a sibling and I'm not sure we'll ever be able to have another one (we had to do several fertility treatments to get him here) I just don't know how to cope with all these emotions. ,
"I (30f) am 3 weeks postpartum with my first. Long story short, a week pp, I got into a fight with my husband (33m) and was taken to the hospital and got formally diagnosed with postpartum depression. 
I’m not sure if it’s ppd or that I’m just not happy being with my husband anymore. We have been together for 4 years, married for one. It probably wasn’t the best to have a baby at the state we were in but I thought having our son would make things better… I haven’t felt loved in my pregnancy, birth, or after. I keep constantly get asked “what’s wrong with me” when I’m just not happy with him. I feel like I keep waiting for him to realize how badly he has treated me and not turn it against me. ",
"Can postpartum depression cause a woman to cheat on a supportive partner, someone she claims to love?

Married 8 years. 3 kids.

I have a married friend whose wife cheated on him 1 year into their marriage. He stated he was very supportive during the pregnancy, and she was fine and didn’t say anything during or after the pregnancy. The guy she cheated on him with was an ex-bf. When they were dating, this was the same ex-bf she was going back and forth between him and my friend. He stated that she would be out all night until 3 am with the ex-bf friend during their first year and half of marriage and say it was nothing, they’re just friends. She lied about the cheating when he asked so they went to marriage counseling….and she lied about the cheating in marriage counseling. She finally confessed to the cheating on their fifth year wedding anniversary and blamed it on postpartum depression. He went into a dark place during this time, stated that the cheating broke something inside of him and that he was embarrassed to be cheated on. He kept saying he did everything right and still got cheated on. He wanted to leave after the cheating, but she threatened him and stated that he would never see his daughters again if he left her, so he stayed. 

So can postpartum depression really cause a woman to cheat on a loving, supportive husband?",
"I have a history of depression since high school and anxiety since I was a kid. I've also been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. I've worked with therapists and med management and was doing ok before I got pregnant. I had a miserable pregnancy, so honestly after like the first week post C-section I felt pretty amazing. Yeah, newborns are hard but compared to how depressed and sick I was during pregnancy I was honestly on a good high. Then my anxiety has been gradually worsening over the last 6 weeks and I reached out to get back on some medication which was helping a bit. 

However, 2 weeks ago we had to put my soul dog down. He was a black lab, my first dog, first ""baby"" and my husband and I adopted him together 11 years ago when we had been dating a couple years. I can't even put into words how much he meant to me and how devastated I still am losing him.

Basically since then I've been struggling so much with increased anxiety and low lows. Even starting to get suicidal ideations which I have struggled with in the past but not in years. Don't worry, no plans on acting on anything - I care about my baby too much and am also aware of the fact this is a mental health issue I need to get treated. I've been drinking too much too which then gives me crippling ""hangxiety"" the next day and messes with the little sleep I am getting. I am well aware I am going down a slippery path. I know I need to start doing things to improve my mental health and life choices. I'm overwhelmed though and struggling getting in to see a therapist after needing to switch from my last one who wasn't great with anything around having a child. 

I guess my question is - could the death of my dog trigger PPA and PPD at 3mo postpartum? Because of my history I knew PPD was likely to happen at some point but I figured it would have initially happened earlier?",

It’s a cold, gloomy day here where I live, and I was yet again feeling the horrible angst of anxiety lingering in the background. How was I going to “get through” this day with nothing on the calendar to keep me distracted?

I’ve lived with anxiety for almost as long as I can remember, and recently started experiencing depression to go with it for the past 3 or 4 years. I always used to wonder what was wrong with me, why I was so broken, and rage about how unfair it was that I was raised with some kind of thought pattern or belief system that kept me in this prison.

At its worst point, I thought about ending my life almost daily. I told myself the world would be so much better off without me as I saw what a drain and toll my depression was taking on my marriage and those around me. I didn’t see any point in continuing to try all the self-help techniques I learned in the thousands of dollars I spent on courses and books. I seriously believed that in a world of “survival of the fittest,” some people just aren’t cut out to handle all the mental and emotional challenges life throws at us, especially when you don’t really know what they are in particular.

To elaborate, I often really had no idea why I was depressed. I was born into an upper middle class family and always had anything I needed or wanted. I make six figures a year, and I have never had to worry about money or where my next rent check was coming from. I’m married to a man who also makes six figures and we’ve always lived in beautiful apartments or townhomes with nice new fixtures and stainless steel appliances. I’ve taken all kinds of vacations and stayed in some beautiful resorts.

Then, my baby girl was born in July of this year. Because I had already struggled with depression before I was pregnant, it’s no surprise that postpartum anxiety and depression hit me like a ton of bricks. Not only was I now struggling to get through each day with the feeling of emptiness I had already been carrying for years, but on top of it all I had a tiny, very needy little human who needed my attention almost 24/7. The hands-down worst part was that she hated (and still hates) the car seat, so even if I did want to try to go somewhere or do something with friends to try to enjoy life and feel some sense of connection, I had to mentally prepare myself for the heartbreak of hearing her scream and cry for the duration of the ride.

But amazingly, after struggling through postpartum for the 16 weeks of my maternity leave at work, I had a beautiful realization while on a walk with her one day as I tried to fight of the anxiety yet again. As terrifying as it was, the truth started speaking to me and I had one of the most beautiful, clean, bright moments of clarity. The reason why I was depressed suddenly seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and all I had to do was admit it to myself.

What I finally had the courage to let myself feel was that I was not at all happy with the life I had spent the last seven and a half years building. I hated my job even though my job title always garnered the admiration of other people. I regretted marrying my husband and getting married at all, and realized I had pushed myself to do what society says and “fight” for my marriage. I hated the townhouse we chose to live in and the area of town we were in, even though it was brand new. And most startling but matter-of-fact of all, I never wanted children. I had just wanted to avoid disappointing others (my husband very much wanted children and my and his parents were dying to be grandparents) and the judgement that is automatically passed on a woman who doesn’t want children (she’s selfish, she just hasn’t met the right man, it’s biological and she’ll “get it” eventually).

Ordinarily, I would have been horrified to admit these things (I had already spent the last 7 years refusing to allow myself to feel them) and been sobbing uncontrollably as I realized that I “got it all wrong.” After all, I was a huge perfectionist and my life was supposed to be perfect, not to mention how hurt other people were going to be if they realized this is really who I am and how I feel.

But recently, I had been reading authors like Markus Rothkranz, Bob Proctor, and Louise Hay, and I realized that the truth is really all we have and all we can rely on. Living our truth the only way we can be really happy, because what’s the alternative? Continuing to pretend and hoping it magically gets better someday? I don’t know if you’ve ever pretended not to be in pain when something is actually physically hurting you, but it’s pretty obvious that you can’t do it forever.

And so, I’ve decided that from now on, I will start being completely truthful with myself and ask myself what I REALLY want. Not what society or my parents or anyone else would be impressed by, or what even I myself “should” be impressed by, like choosing to be married. While I do want a partner who I love more than anything, I’ve realized that committing to them legally through marriage may not be actually what I want, and that’s totally okay. The sad part is I would have normally judged others if they felt that way, which I why I believe I snuffed out that part of me for so long.

My plan is to begin refusing to live parts of my life that are inauthentic to me, starting with my job. Maternity leave was perfect in that it forced me to make a decision between staying at a job I hate and staying home to raise my daughter. I chose the latter, and my last day at my job will be in six weeks. My family is pushing me to look for another remote job to replace that one, but I won’t be. I’m stepping out on faith that the work that I truly love doing will find me, and money will come as a side effect.

I am telling my husband I want to separate in a few weeks’ time. I don’t want anything from him and will let him take anything he wants from the house we share now, and I will be giving the rest away for free to anyone who wants or needs it. I have always wanted to completely start from scratch with my clothes, furniture, and other crap that I have accumulated over the years that doesn’t even make me happy. I am so looking forward to having a blank canvas to start living a minimalist lifestyle and thoughtfully build up my possessions with items I love and bring me joy.

Even though I never really wanted children, I love my daughter with all my heart and soul. I am dedicated to being the best parent I can be for her and being nothing but a support system for her authentic personality to come shining through and for her to express herself in the world in the way that makes her the happiest. I have been reading books like “Unconditional Parenting” and “Parent Effectiveness Training” so that I can be extremely mindful of my unconscious habits and patterns and hopefully break generational curses.

I don’t know what starting all over at 28 will be like, but I can’t wait to find out. I know there are moments where I’ll probably be more depressed than ever and doubtful that blowing up my entire life was the right thing to do, but I’m also choosing to accept that it’s just part of the process. I’ve already told one person about my plans and have asked her to support me when times get tough.

I’ll be sharing my diaries mostly as an outlet and a form of reflection for myself, but I do hope that in the process I can inspire others who may be in a similar situation to realize that they can do this too. It hurts my heart more than anything that so many of us struggle with mental illness today and don’t know why, but that the answer could be so painfully obvious, it’s too scary to even consider. I hope you all will follow me in my journey and wish me luck along the way, and I hope I can be brave enough to show anyone who’s reading this that changing your life is entirely possible.",
"My wife is 1.5 months post partum and wearing me down with constant abuse even while I try to help. Everyone has told me it is PPD/A/R, but she refuses to see a therapist and constantly wakes me up at night during the half of the night when I'm supposed to sleep and she is feeding the baby such that I'm getting 3 hours of sleep a night on a good night and sometimes less. I do not wake her up while I am supposed to feed/tend LO.

But sleep is not even the half of it. She is sometimes indifferent to me (only speaking to direct me to bring her this or that), but frequently nasty about totally nonsensical issues (e.g. did not wipe the floor with the rag she normally uses) and sometimes actually abusive (throwing things at me). Our whole relationship seems to  have become transactional and/or negative. She shows minor signs of improvement from time to time, but almost always goes back to her bad behavior after a few days. 

Every now and again we joke or flirt, but it's often coming from me and on her end it's few and far between. This says nothing of what she has done with my MIL against me to make me uncomfortable in our own home. I can express no negative emotions (e.g. tiredness) lest I earn myself a round of loud reminders that she is more tired and I shouldn't complain. We can have no serious discussions where I do not immediately agree with her, otherwise she accuses me of manipulating her into yelling/throwing things (I try not to argue, but we still have to make decisions).

I have tried to remind her of how we met and fell in love and all the good times to conjure some good memories for me and for her, but it doesnt really seem to alter her attitude toward me beyond the few minutes when we have these conversations. I try sympathizing with her feelings of being overwhelmed, frustrated etc, but she denies having any such feelings. This is not the woman I married. Read other posts for more details.

Recently, we talked to my mother on video chat about entirely innocuous stuff (health, showing the baby, every day issues). My mother showed more concern, warmth, and love for me in that call than my wife has since our child was born. Afterward, I was noticeably emotional because I felt the loneliness and the hardship of being with my wife redouble in contrast to my mother's warmth and kindness. 

While I was blurry eyed and trying to suppress crying, my wife looked at me with contempt on her face and said ""whatever your problem is, we are not talking about it tonight, I need my sleep."" My heart went cold at that--like I don't need sleep too--and that she could say such a thing when I am obviously hurting. When I did actually discuss it with her the next day, she said ""you're just being manipulative"" and refused to own up to any bad behavior. 

Now here's the catch: because of local rules (not living in NA/Europe) my wife controls most of our money including savings even though I am the primary breadwinner (she's on unpaid maternity leave). I told her, ""I need X amount, please put it on this card so I can pay for therapy this month."" She says: ""it's too much, not this month."" I know she does not like my therapist, because my therapist has encouraged me to draw boundaries with MIL, for instance, and money is also not an issue. When she said this, my heart turned to stone for the second time because therapy is honestly my only lifeline right now.

I told her she needed to give me the money and I reminded her of our previous agreements not to leverage money against each other and that she would give me money I deposited on her account when I needed it. 

I got upset with her when she just kept saying ""no, no, no"", ""I'm not listening"" etc and I reminded her that her ex did the same thing with money to her and she hated it. After that, she simply shut down and refused to discuss it. In the end, when I insisted she transfer my salary from last month back to me, she said that if I persist with asking for money back or money for therapy, she will divorce me. I am so gobsmacked right now and feeling super vulnerable. I happen to know how to get my hands on a small portion of what she has deposited (enough to carry me through the end of the month without therapy), but I think if I take it out, it will be the end and she will actually kick me our of our home/seperate/divorce. 

I feel like I have to take this money for my own well-being and possibly survival, but the thought of it ending my marriage and probably any real access to LO, breaks my heart.

Advice would be welcome, but mostly perspective--I need to know if I sound insane or not. Am I being dramatic here or am I really in as bad a situation as I think I am?",

I had a terrible experience with Lexapro and would like to know if anyone else has had a similar reaction or can offer some insight.

I was prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro and took my first dose yesterday. I also take Adderall for ADD, but I skipped it yesterday to see how the Lex would affect me. After having breakfast and taking a postnatal vitamin, I took the Lexapro.

Within an hour, I felt somewhat energized. However, after 2-3 hours, I began to feel very strange—dazed, sluggish, with a racing heart and confusion. When my husband came home briefly, he said my pupils were ginormous, which really freaked me out. I told him I felt weird, almost as if I hadn’t slept in days. He thought I was overthinking things and left for work. I was terrified when he left because I didn't want to be home alone with the baby. 

I called my doctor and spoke with a nurse, who suggested my symptoms might be related to the Adderall. I explained that it had been almost 24 hours since my last dose of it (10 mg IR). She then suggested I might be experiencing anxiety and advised me to take it easy but to continue taking the Lexapro. She also told me to call or go to the ER if my symptoms worsened.

I know how drugs feel. I was high, and not in a fun way. It felt similar to a comedown from Molly (MDMA) or a speed bender with no sleep. This unsettling feeling lasted about 4 to 5 hours before improving, but I felt on edge and strung out for the rest of the day. I realize this isn’t typical for SSRIs, but I can’t dismiss what I experienced. It didn’t feel like an anxiety attack; my body was reacting poorly to the medication.

Could this have been mild serotonin syndrome? I’m curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. I want help for my postpartum depression, but I'm terrified to experience this again. ",
"Hello, I’m a reporter writing about postpartum depression communities in NYC. I’m looking for people who are eager to share their experience. If anyone is interested and wants to talk, please reach out to me either through dm or leave a comment below and I’ll reach out. Thank you all.

(The reason why I’m writing this story is because I think it’s important to raise awareness about the postpartum depression communities so that people can have a deeper understanding about it.)",
"Just had my baby in October. The pregnancy was a terrible experience, i was diagnosed with HG (Hyperemesis gravidarum) and was extremely sick the first 2 1/2 months. So i couldn’t work and used all my savings for bills, when i finally was able to go back (bartender) I could only work certain shifts because i would get so sick or lightheaded and pass out. So i still wasnt making the money i used to.
Fast forward to now… i am going back to work in December and this has already been the longest two months. 
I feel like i cant provide for myself or my child. My husband is currently paying our house bills but I feel like a burden being there. Asking for anything makes me feel terrible. 
My insurance hasn’t gone through with the baby either so I’ve had to pay (borrowed from my mother because i literally cant pay) $500 out of pocket to get her doctor’s appointments already. 
I feel like im already failing, i cry everyday over it. I cry when i feed, when she sleeps. Im  just sad. ",
"i been thinking about this a long time, I dont want to have another kid 

I can barely handle my toddler 

  
and I'm still debating of giving my daughter up for adoption but to be honest with you I didn't exactly get the help that I need like for my postpartum depression, I'm speaking about medication and thepray 

I have not done it 

  
another Redditor wants me to give up my child for adoption 

  
what should I do ?

  
i know its my choice in the very end 

  
and it does look like my daughter is getting attached to me and I dont wanna give her up where already forming an attachment to a different family 

and I also don't want her to get screwed by the system, she will probably go to foster care, if I were to put her up for adoption 

  
I been in foster care and Im fucked up from I, well not just from being in foster care that's besides the point

"So we went to the mall today expecting it would be a happy day for us to unwind, it turned out I was crying the whole time we were at nursery lounge I was holding up my tears when we were walking but I exploded while feeding my baby, I just feel so lonely, I have never been this so lonely my entire life. I was thinking that going to the mall was my favorite hobby pre-baby and it doesn’t interest me anymore. Plus I feel like my partner is so distant. I just feel so sad all sad. I am sorry if I vented out here. Please just tell me it’s going to get better.�� because I’m still crying rn these moods so low it’s killing me.",
"How are we dealing with PPD these days with unsupportive partners? I've had 3 babies under 3 years... I've had depression prior and anxiety. After meeting my partner he decided for me that the Zoloft I was I on wasn't helping ME! Instead I switched to medical marijuana which didn't help and then wound up pregnant so then I obviously had nothing to help with my stressors. 3 babies later and I'm exhausted mentally and physically. I forgot to mention he is a narcissist most of the time. I recently have been having more break downs manic rages. I tell my partner what I need and it just doesn't help me. I recently went to my OB and they prescribed me birth control and a low dose of Zoloft. My partner doesn't support the Zoloft or the birth control. I want the bc because I do not want to be pregnant again. I am currently breast feeding and am apprehensive to taking the Zoloft and I know all the research is ""fine"". I wish I could go back to marijuana. I try to voice everything I'm feeling and I just feel unheard and end up getting names called in my face like I'm psycho and mentally unstable during a fight. I get told my feelings aren't real and my opinions are wrong. The walls close in almost everyday and I have no other support system around me, no family, no friends close that I can just go hang out with. l used to see a therapist which helped me, my partner said she did nothing for me and I got ""worse"". He doesn't believe in health care. I feel I got worse because I was being deprived of what I want and need. I'm just on a merry go round and I guess needing to vent or hear others advice of others go through it as well ... :-/",
"I had my first baby after 2 second trimester losses about 4 months ago. I struggled with anxiety prior to my pregnancy and have been medicated for it for awhile now. At my postpartum appt I was put on meds for ppa/ppd. I am feeling so miserable, I feel like running away from everything i’ve ever wanted. I’m just so unhappy with my current situation, I feel like i’ve lost my entire identity. My baby is pretty difficult at times he’s been colic-y since just a few weeks old, screaming for long periods of time for what seems to be no reason. He also spits up quite a bit and it’s a major hassle at times because he goes through a dozen bibs, spit rags, and clothes a day. when does it get better? what can I do to help myself feel better? I just feel so lost. ",
"For does who have gotten better? When did it lift? I’m currently on medication but between trying to keep up with home, full-time work, part-time childcare, being behind on bills, and job searching i find myself wanting an “out” every month. Is that just stress? Is it depression? Can an OB up my dosage? 

I’m starting to run dangerously low of the “fight” I had in me.
",
"So. I think I've been suppressing my PPD for some months now. I was really bad until we sleep trained, and after that I was sleeping and feeling wonderful. 

But as the months went by, I got more and more anxious. My baby's fusses and cries set me off and put me into a fight or flight response. 

Well I think my body finally had enough and my brain was waking up in the middle of the night, racing with thoughts. Sometimes accompanied by a racing heart. 

I am now very sleep deprived, has this happened to anyone else? Did going on anxiety meds help? I've also been working on healthy coping mechanisms in therapy. Lots of square breathing when I feel the anxious thoughts pop up. I really hope if I go on anxiety meds I'll finally sleep more than 4 hours.",
"Cw: suicide 

I post on here a lot bc it’s the easiest way for me to dump my emotions. 
I’m struggling with depression and have had suicidal ideation. My husband is aware and so is my counselor. I told my husband today that it’s not that I want to die, I just don’t want to live. 


I received sad news today. A military wife that we knew years ago killed herself about a week ago. She was 54 and had been dealing with depression for a long time. I just feel so sad that she thought that was the only way out of her depression. 

I am just worried I will never get better. I am always at my limit with the kids, errands, and life. The hubs and I have been talking about me going to a treatment program so I can get better. But I can’t even think past Christmas or January. My bday is in January and I don’t want to celebrate it in any way. I feel like I am just going to be let down by my husband and my kids. 
I just wish I could be better now and be who I used to be. ",
"Sometimes, sorry most days, I want to go to sleep and never wake up so I don’t have to go to work, and i hate my job like I genuinely hate it

Dont ask me why im working a job that i hate

"Sort of looking to make friends/chat with other women going through similar experience. I’m 3 weeks PP & having the worst PPA. It’s been so hard & I am so scared of taking care of my baby by myself. My partner is currently on leave with me, but I will eventually have to care for my son all on my own when my partner goes back to work. I feel SO bad because I never anticipated this nightmare. 

Anxiety comes & goes throughout the day, but it’s usually really bad in the mornings & evenings. We are sleeping in shifts, but it’s hard to rest when I feel on edge all the time. I can describe my anxiety as being afraid of being a mom, never sleeping again, losing my mind, losing my family, or simply never enjoying motherhood. This baby was planned & I wanted to be a mom, but ever since I got pregnant, things went downhill. Pregnancy was awful & now postpartum is going terribly. I’m afraid that I ruined my life, my body, and my relationship. Can anyone relate or want to chat? ",
"Hi all, wasn’t exactly sure where to post this so hopefully this is the best place to reach anyone else out there who has experienced this. I’m 4.5 months postpartum and overall doing better but definitely still dealing with my majorly traumatic birth. I have been dealing with terrible PPD/PPA and finally started Lexapro which has been a game changer. Super long post warning-thank you to anyone who actually makes it through the whole thing! 

Got induced at 38 weeks due to my history of high BP and worry of pre-eclampsia and baby measuring large. Started with miso, things actually started moving quite quickly and had a foley bulb placed about 10ish hours later (HORRIBLE pain inserting and the contractions after…OUCH). It also worked, out in 3 hours and 3cm dilated. Started me on pitocin nice and slow. Finally, started working. I guess I should also say that I have a history of cervical cancer and have been through the wringer with OB stuff and majorly trusted my OB and really wanted her to be the one to deliver my daughter. She actually picked up a shift just so she could be there. So…she gets on shift at 7pm. Comes and checks me, 5cm dilated and baby was only at a -2 station but she broke my water anyway. I had mild polyhydraminos (extra amniotic fluid) so it was like a geyser. My contractions were IMMEDIATELY horrible. I then asked for the epidural. Got up and went to the bathroom and while in there heard the anesthesiologist come in so I came back out and my doctor was already back in and said she wanted to check baby. Ended up telling me I’m getting a VERY emergency c-section and ended up calling a code blue in the hospital bc baby’s cord had come out with all my fluid. I got put on my hands and knees with a nurse’s hand up me holding baby’s head off of the cord. I’m pretty sure every nurse in that hospital was in there and they raced me to the OR. On my way getting rushed down the hall, someone asked the nurse for a pulse check and she said she didn’t have a pulse, it scared the living shit out of me but apparently she just meant she wasn’t checking the cord for one since she was holding baby’s head. Better communication would have been nice. Since I didn’t have an epidural yet, they had to put me under general anesthesia so I missed everything � my parents and my in-laws got to meet my daughter before me. I don’t even remember meeting her because apparently they gave me a medication to hopefully help me forget some of the trauma but I remember every single second and only don’t remember waking up and meeting my daughter. From the time the prolapse was discovered to the time she was out was 9 minutes. It was insane and the most traumatic thing I’ve truly ever been through. I am SO grateful and thankful and all the things that my sweet girl is here and healthy with no lasting effects and that I made it through ok as well. But man, if I’m not still struggling to work through that and the loss of those firsts that I will never, ever get since she is our only baby. I still cry myself to sleep sometimes replaying it all. I just wish we would have talked and gotten me the epidural before breaking my water. Or just kept waiting to see how my body continued to react to the pitocin. I think the hardest thing for me is I went in with basically NO agenda/plan except for some hopes of delayed cord clamping, no wiping off of the vernix, immediate skin to skin, that kind of thing (which I got none of, of course �). I legit told my doctor the week before when discussing options that my ONLY fear was an induction that ended in emergency c-section under general anesthesia. She told me “that only happens every 2-3 years and is super unlikely”. I was ok with a vaginal birth, c-section, medication, whatever. Just NOT general anesthesia because I knew what that would mean. My heart is just totally broken over it all. 

Not sure what I’m looking for, I guess just anyone else that has had to get put under GA? How have you moved forward? Thanks in advance ❤️",
"Anyone have any experience taking this medication? Wondering about the side effects…I was prescribed Lexapro and had bad side effects, made my anxiety 1000x worse. I’m a FTM with a 4 week old and every day I feel like I’m not going to make it :( ",
"I'm not sure if I love my bf anymore. Everyday I can feel us drifting apart more and more. I try expressing how I feel and all it does is ""hurts his feelings"". All I express is that I would like him to show more affection/attention to me, to help me feel beautiful after giving birth but he acts like it's sooooo hard. I express that I'm struggling and he then he acts like he has it harder than I do. Don't get me wrong I understand dad's go through depression and having hard times especially after having a baby but... I'm literally 10 months pp and I'm still struggling hard everyday. I have to explain to him that my hormones have literally changed and I don't feel like me ans he just acts like he's too down to help me. I just want a partner that will take care of me. I take care of my baby, my cats, him. I'm tired. I'm drained. And I feel ugly and unwanted all the time. Why don't men try harder at understanding how their women feel after birth and why does it feel like I'm constantly having to explain I still have ppd and I'm still struggling with it daily so a little compliment would help go a long way.

"I haven’t been diagnosed or anything, but my husband thinks I have PPD. My mood has been all over the place (anger, anxiety, mood swings, etc.) I’m tired a lot but my 4/23 baby is preventing me from sleeping a ton. I’m more irritable than normal. But everything I read about PPD says that a lot of issues circle around the baby? But I’m happiest when it’s just me and my baby. It’s when work gets in the mix and my relationship with my husband… I feel like I get pulled in so many different directions that I go crazy, and my baby is the thing that calms me. Even when he’s going crazy… would rather be with him than anything else. So that’s not PPD? My husband wants me to go to therapy and to think about meds but I don’t want to go numb… I haven’t been on meds before. I used to smoke before being pregnant and that helped my anxiety… but with breastfeeding I don’t want to do that. So idk… not sure what advice there is to give or if I just needed to type it out. I don’t know what to do…",

Between the new baby, my husband gone on deployment, i just found out that I have to have pretty intensive surgery which will be a month or so after he gets back, trying to keep my marriage in a healthy spot, we have to move soon, finding out that alot of prior medical stuff wasn't documented, chronic pain, some past trauma, I'm trying to hold it all together be super mom but it's not working. I'm drowning. Sometimes when i lay down to go to bed i get beyond amped up for no reason st all.I seriously consider doing something really stupid more often than I should. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because they will take my baby away because my husband isn't here. I don't want to talk to my husband because he already has so much on his plate and so many plans and has already reassured me that he will be there to support me through all of the nitty gritting that come with the very long surgery recovery amd everything that comes after.. I know that i can't do anything because I have to be here to take care of my baby. Logic is the only thing keeping me alive right now and I'm worried that one really bad day will send me over the edge of illogical.

I know that I should find someone to talk too but I'm scared. I dont know what I need. ",
"I had my baby 4 months ago with the “love of my life”. This great individual has “cheated on me” several times, looking up other women online. First time, I about kms, and literally drank myself into oblivion. Second time, he tried to hurt me, 2 months pregnant. Every important milestone has been ruined by him doing this, like day before marriage, engagement, my baby being born, and even two days after our son got out of the hospital at 13 days old. We spent seven weeks apart when I was 20 weeks pregnant, and I cried every single night that he wasn’t with me, and I missed him. While, he cheated on me, as my body was literally falling apart and barely holding on to keep our son alive. He gets mad at me when I find out and I did nothing wrong. A mad that I have never seen before. I have a prolapsed uterus that is due to stress, and in result I will have a hysterectomy. I am in shambles, heart broken, and he is so happy because “pregnancy was so hard on him”. I had preeclampsia due to the stress he put he under, and I have so many health issues now. I miss my best friend, and I regret everything, but I love my son more than anything. Does it get better? Is there light on the outside of this horrific tunnel? Please I just needed some encouragement to get through this.",
My twins turn one soon and I’m just having a horrible week. I have spent the last 2 days crying and I am just feeling so low. My partner tried to have a gentle conversation today about playing with the babies more and it just reinforced all the negative feelings I was already having. He didn’t mean for it to be like that and he was just looking for a way to help me bond more but I’ve been left feeling like I’m really not good enough and not doing enough for my babies. So now I feel like I can’t stand there with all our friends and family and have them celebrate our babies first year when I’ve just been failing them all along. I’m already in therapy and taking antidepressants but I’m in a real slump this week. I don’t know what I want from this post but thanks for reading. ,
"Hi all, I’m a F(23) and have a 10 month old, my first baby. I’m trying to figure out if I’m struggling with PPD or anxiety or if this is totally normal : 

Some information: 
I’m a stay at home mom, my husband works.

On his night shifts, I stay at my parents because I’m too afraid to stay home alone. 

He recently took some time off, which meant I had him home for a while. He just went back to work and I’ve been having such a difficult time staying home - and the “root” of the problem is being afraid to spend wake windows with my baby. 

We have a routine and when I’m busy with the essentials (feeding, pumping, diaper changes, etc) I’m fine. But when everything slightly settles down and my baby is playing and I get a glimpse of the clock and realize I have 1-2 hours of wake time with them still I begin to panic, I cry nonstop.  

I’ve felt like this before with night shifts, but all other shifts I was completely fine. And out of nowhere, after his time off I can’t function on any kind of shift. 

I’m just looking for some answers/ words of advice. Idk. I’m just so lost.. 

If you need some more information feel free to ask. I feel like a rambling man, so many thoughts in my head ",
"The moment I met you I fell in love. 
I knew I would. 
I'd felt you and thought about you for 40 weeks and 6 days. 
I'd looked forward to loving you for as long as I can remember. 
I'd looked forward to being your mum for as long as I can remember. 
I loved you before I recognised you. 
I loved long you before I got over the shock of how you arrived.
When I gave birth to you I gave birth to a new person I could get to know. A new perfect soul, a fresh new life. 
I also gave birth to a new me. A me that I still don't know or recognise. A me with a new lobsided soul, a complicated new life. 
For now I will continue to show up for you every day. 
I will soak in the smiles, the laughs and the hugs. 
And maybe one day I will recognise myself again. 
Maybe one day I will fall in love with the new me I birthed. 

Something I wrote at a hard to time. I'm celebrating 2.5 years since the birth of my first and 10 months since my second. After months, I'm finally finding a little bit of joy every day.

Sending love to you, wherever you are on your journey.",
"I am 26 and I'm 2 months PP  (11 Weeks this Friday) 
I don't know if I have PPD I just know that I feel fat and ugly. I don't have to time to work out because if my baby isn't asleep or eating he's crying. I have always been a bigger girl but right before I got pregnant I had lost about 50 pounds from taking metformin to help with my PCOS. I felt confident and prettier, now I just feel disgusting and I hate looking in the mirror again. ",
"I have a 6mo daughter, I was diagnosed with moderate/severe postpartum depression when she was just 2 weeks old. 
Symptoms hit me like a train and I became very unwell very quickly. 
Since then, I have been commenced on sertraline. Initially 50mg, then increased to 100mg, and then again to 150mg. 
I am doing a lot better, but I haven’t had a single month of stability yet. I’m still having quite significant low periods. 
My perinatal consultant has recommended increasing to the max dose of sertraline (200mg) but I’m wondering whether this is even worth it, as I don’t feel like it’s working very well when I’m still unstable quite a lot of the time.  

Maybe a medication change would be better? I’m no expert, and I trust their judgement but I feel like they haven’t listened to my concern that the current medication might just not work. ",
"I’m already in tears after writing the title of this post. I (27F) have a 9 month old son who is perfect in all ways. He’s slept through the night in his own room since 3 months, isn’t ever fussy, and is happy all the time. He’s given us no trouble outside of regular baby needs. 

I grew up with a deeply disturbed, narcissistic mother and an enabling father, with whom I finally went no contact with last year. All my life I wanted to be a mom and give my family a better life that my siblings and I had. I’ve spent years in therapy getting professional help and finding medication, and am in a very happy, healthy marriage.

Now that I am a mom, though, I’m absolutely miserable. I want nothing to do with my son or motherhood in general. I stay home while my husband works and every day when I hear the front door close after he leaves I burst into tears because I don’t know how I’m going to do another 10 hours alone with him. My MIL is great and helps with him a ton, however even after a full day without him I dread picking him up. 

I had a really hard time bonding with him for the first few months and it got better for a bit, but now it’s like he’s not even my own baby. I feel responsible for taking care of him but I look at it like a chore. I absolutely despise myself for feeling this way - I have a happy, healthy, and sweet baby, which a lot of people would do anything to have. I feel broken. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me or why I am this way. He is just a baby and hasn’t done anything and doesn’t deserve a mother who doesn’t want to be around him. I cry constantly because of the guilt. My husband comes home and is completely obsessed with him and it makes me feel so ashamed of myself. 

I am the first of my friends to have a baby and he wasn’t planned. My therapist says the way I feel is normal for a new mom but I just can’t imagine any other mothers wanting nothing to do with their child the way I do. I’m so terrified of accidentally becoming my own mother, who was self-centered and unaffectionate - but it’s like something inside of me is incapable of motherhood. I don’t know what to do. 

I had bad postpartum and my PMDD returned after giving birth, both of which I have found great relief from in hormone therapy in the last few months, but I’m not hormonal I’m just miserable. I want to be better for him but I don’t what’s missing from me. If anyone has advice please share. I feel so alone. ",
"I am a mom of 3.

My oldest sweet baby girl passed away at 3 in 2020. I of course miss her every single day. 
I had my 2nd baby girl in 2022 and I knew I was absolutely ready for her. Well back in February of this year I found out I was pregnant again with my 3rd baby girl. This time unplanned. Whole entire pregnancy I could not bond the way I'd hoped. I knew I wasn't ready for another baby but my husband and I had done this to ourselves. (I feel awful even saying that)

 I just really wanted to focus on my toddler for another couple years before even considering another baby. My baby girl is here now and I love on her and protect her like I would my others but I don't understand why it feels as if she isn't even mine. That hurts me so badly �  she's such a beautiful, sweet little girl who didn't ask to be here. I do love her so much but I don't feel the same bond and I feel terrible about that. I never EVER want her to know I've felt this way, even a little. 

On top of it, my 2nd born is going through her terrible 2s so that's been awful too some days. I'm grateful my husband is so patient and helpful but I'm scared I'm not going to know how to get through this and end up having to go to a mental health hospital. Yet I don't want to leave my girls without me � I'm so lost. ",
"I have a wonderful little boy who is 3 years old. He's been challenging at times of course and I really struggled when he was a newborn but put that down mostly to a traumatic birth.

5 weeks ago I had a planned section for our second little boy. Birth was great and recovery ok. Problem is a just feel so desperately sad. I cry every night when up feeding him. Husband does every other feed as we are formula feeding. He's up every 2 hours. I've had a panic attack a day for the last 3 days all around how I can't see how to cope. I just don't feel that overwhelming love and bonding I should do. I think someone else would be better at taking care of him and I'm feeling regret. I want my old life back.

I feel so pathetic. My husband is so supportive and keeps reminding me newborn days are hell and it gets better. I should accept this and believe him as we have a wonderful 3 year old who sleeps great and I love dearly. So why have I spent all morning sobbing and considering self harm (used to SH in the past) to get through the day ?

Is this just exhaustion? Do other people feel like this and I should just get a grip and power on?",
"My baby will be 7 months next week and I still struggle with everything. All I ever wanted was to be a mom and now that I am I hate it. I love my baby more than anything but I struggle every day and every hour I have to take care of her. I have a really supportive partner that will take time off every chance he gets and will comme home if I feel that I can’t take it anymore but I still feel completely alone. Every day I feel guilty that I can’t be the mom that she deserves and that maybe that her and my husband would be better off if I wasn’t there. I don’t have ""bad"" thoughts but the best way I can explain it is I want to be out of this situation. I would never abandon her because I love her but I feel so traped… 

I have pp anger and I have been talking to my doctor about ppd. I don’t want to be on medication yet ( although if I have to I will). I have been doing acupuncture but it has not been helping. I had a really easy pregnancy and birth but she has been far from an easy baby. She was diagnosed with silent reflux and CMPA when she was 4 weeks old. All she did for months was cry and it took a huge chunk of me. She would not sleep in her bed and I refused to co-sleep so that led to sleep deprevation (it is better now, not great but better). She doesn’t cry as much but complains all day long and I can never put her down to even eat she just wants to be in my arms. 

I have been told that I gets better but I feel like I will never see a better day. Will I ever get use to this?",
"I don’t know if I have PPD. Some days I feel like it’s hard to find myself but then I remember that I’m taking on a new role as a mom and that it’s normal to feel this way. I also feel like a lot of my sadness is coming from my life shifting  so fast. I mean of course it is, we just had a baby and now I’m a mom. But it just feels like it happened so quick. I was so use to being at my 9-5 everyday and now I’m at home with the baby everyday. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a blessing and I love being with her, but I’m feeling trapped in my home and I need to get out. My husband and I go on daily walks when he gets home from work and sometimes go to a store every now and then but I’m still not 100% comfortable with it until my baby gets her shots. I cry randomly a lot and just feel like I miss my old life & freedom. I’m really just trying to adjust to this new life as a mom and I can’t wait to find myself again. I keep telling myself that I know it’ll get better. I also breastfeed my baby and feel like that has taken a toll on me mentally as well. Especially with pumping, I am really considering switching over to formula because I think it’ll put me in a better place mentally and I need to take care of myself too so I can give my baby the best version of myself. It’s just the guilt getting to me that’s making me consider stopping. Does anyone think this would help? ",
"My PPD really kicked into high gear when I started work earlier this year. I had a traumatic birth and my twins were born premature and spent weeks and weeks on the NICU. I have generalized anxiety and have forever. After having my babies it really came on full force. I was angry, depressed, not myself. spoke with my OB and she put me on Lexapro. It helps tremendously!

But, almost every Sunday I have a bit of Sunday blues knowing I have to work and can’t spend every minute with my twins. I worry about things that haven’t happened, like having to travel for work and being away from them. Yes, I have separation anxiety! My husband and I have gone on a few dates but anytime something pops up that would require a babysitter I dread it, sometimes to the point of tears. I have no desire to be away from them. I think my traumatic birth comes into play and NICU experience but I also realize I need therapy. 

If you’ve had therapy for your PPD/PPA what kind of therapist did you seek out? ",
"I just had a baby 1 month ago …. I’ve been feeling helpless lately and hopeless. I’m in nursing school…. In the middle of my semester…. I took a break from school for 1 week after having a C-Section….. and then I had to go back …. Plenty of people in my cohort tell me that I’m strong…. But I feel so weak…. I go back to work on the end of this month and I have no idea how I’m gonna juggle school, newborn baby and work…. I feel like I’m going to lose everything I worked so hard for… I feel like such a failure…. I have 6 months left till graduation I hope I’m strong enough to make it.

8 weeks pp and I feel like each day I’m getting worse. Sometimes I don’t even know who I am. I feel lost and disconnected with my partner. I can’t even find joy in anything. I feel angry and resentment for no reason. I look in the mirror and I don't recognize myself. I feel like a stranger in my own body. I look at my partner or friends and family and they all seem like strangers to me. I don't feel connected to anyone and I feel like I have to pretend. Is it normal to feel like everyone is a stranger to you even if you've known them for years? I mean I feel like a stranger to myself. I don't know who I am or even who I was. Things I use to enjoy don't make me feel better. I can't find enjoyment in anything. I use to love fashion and creating fun outfits I don't even know how to get dressed because I feel like I don't have an identity and I can't put a simple outfit together without feeling awkward and out of place. I'm doing therapy and I don't even know if that's helping because again each day I feel like I'm getting worse. I just want to feel normal again but I don't know how. ,
"I think I’m going through and identity crisis (for lack of a better term). PP 4 months. Beautiful baby girl and she’s healthy. But I can’t feel like myself starting with becoming pregnant but much worse now. My husband is so supportive and is a great dad but lately I’ve been so mean to him. I’ve been picking fights more than ever. I used to be a happy go lucky person that would go with the flow, but lately I feel like my head is just above water. My husband’s job is making him travel next week for 5 days and I’m so anxious about it. I know I’ve got support and I’ll be okay but I almost resent him for having to go. He enjoys his job and it’s a travel for his company situation bc they’re in a pinch. I’m angry though bc I thought he wouldn’t be traveling for work when we had the baby. I push him to find a new job but he really loves his current one. I’m putting too much pressure on him and he’s already getting pressure from work. He would blindly support me with any career decision I make and I feel like I don’t do the same for him. My mood swings are starting to effects his self esteem. He understands it’s bc I’m pp but damn I’ve been so cruel to him. I’m hoping by recognizing this I can get better.. I think it’s a manifestation of my anxiety. (Been on Zoloft for years my psychiatrist just increased it and I also have a therapist for baseline anxiety.) I’m also going through so much changing I feel like I’ve no sense of control. My hair is falling out so much, I’m going back to work soon, and I’m so nervous about 5 days being alone. How can I support his career when I’m resentful of it? I know he doesn’t have much of a choice, and reassures me that it’s just this one time since they’re in a pinch but I feel like I can’t trust him even though I know I can. I’m taking everything so personally too. I’m just not myself and now I’m tearing my husband down with me. I want to life him up and make him feel good but how can I when I can’t even do that for myself? When does it get better? I can’t keep using him as an abusive punching bag. This is not who I am. When will I go back to being me??",
"I am 8 months pp and my baby keeps getting up every 1 or 2 hrs at night and it’s really taking a toll on my health now esp mentally. I get upset really easily at anything and I do not have any support from my husband night timeX he is work from home and isn’t that busy but still. On top of it, some times he makes certain remarks that really hurt me and I end up crying whole day and night. One such day is today. I acknowledge that I am extra sensitive these days and I try to tell him that. To which his reply is my post partum is never ending. I really don’t know who to seek help. I wanted to goto toilet and baby was little cranky… I told him to carry her, and he just did and let the baby cry. He’s the father and can put some effort to distract her or try to make her calm but he didn’t. Instead told me he will, only when he wants to. I think I needed to vent as I don’t know what else to do, how to ignore things that he does or says. I feel terrible crying to be in the state and take care of the baby. ",

"I know there's a million potential reasons why. Anyone notice this postpartum specifically and get an answer from a provider why? Or figure out yourself?  Low doses used to be too much, postpartum maxed out and might as well take sugar. 2 years postpartum and we've tried it all. ",
"For those who are medicated for their PPD/ PPA, which one do you find helped you the best? Also, did it make you gain weight? I’m already struggling with my weight from breastfeeding on top of my PPD, so I really don’t think I can handle any more weight gain. ",
"What’s the most polite way to heal?

The world spins on. Well meaning people ask about more children and comment on the way my body looks. What they don’t know is that I didn’t know going into the hospital that day it would be the last time i was ever pregnant.  That a calm delivery would turn into a life saving hysterectomy. That depression, anxiety and anger would color my first year with my child. The holidays would feel scary and again worries that I was being selfish oscillating with feelings of anger that people were unaware of my experience. That returning to work at the hospital would turn into heart wrenching trigger that I should feel grateful that my daughter is healthy. The sadness felt unjustified. The shoulds swirled in my brain. This is nothing like I expected. Like so many families, we needed my salary and health benefits. Just keep going. Push it down, with time the memories will fade. Memories would pop up “Am I going to die?” The look of panic on my care teams faces. But you are fine, your daughter is healthy… keep moving forward. Be gracious, be thankful, be appreciative. What’s the most polite way to heal?  You can feel sad, just not too sad and make sure your sadness doesn’t make anyone uncomfortable. Pull yourself together. Don’t make too much of a fuss, just keep going. Did you write your thank you notes? You don’t want to be an attention seeker, deal with this in therapy. Keep it to yourself! Be polite and gracious, they are well meaning. What’s the most polite way to grieve? It’s been a year, it’s time to move forward. Don’t hurt their feelings, sit on your seat of nails with a grateful smile. “My friend also went through what you did, they used a surrogate for their second child. You have options!” Smile and nod, swallow the anger and repeat to yourself “you have so much to be grateful for”. ",
"I need to vent. I’m 7 weeks pp. I feel all the expected things sleep deprived, overwhelmed at times etc.. but is it normal to have to the feeling of hopelessness in the pit of my stomach. I just broke down crying over something stupid and I really wanted to vent to someone when I realized there is no one I can talk too. My family doesn’t come around much. Friends been MIA. I don’t think my husband understands. He says I’m being angry and mean. When I constantly tell him I’m sad and dealing with a lot. We have fought so much. I’ve begged for him to just be gentle with me during this fragile time. But honestly why do I even have to do that. This lack of support has messed up my breastfeeding journey which is adding to my stress..I love my baby but there are moments I feel like I made a huge mistake and that scares me. I feel like a stranger inside my own body. I’m waiting for this feeling to pass. I am miserable. ",
"I’m 4 months pp. ever since I’ve had my baby I’ve been feeling very neglected and alone. My partner is mostly working and doesn’t have a lot of time to spend on taking care of the baby or me. I’m with the lo all day tending to her needs and trying to maintain a sort of a routine especially with sleep and stuff. I deal with her all day and at night when she wakes. I’m exhausted and burnt out with no time to take a break, exercise or just take care of myself. My husband is not very proactive and encouraging. I always need to ask him to help. When he does have time between work he sits on his phone instead of helping me out or spending time with me. Finally when he’s done at night he just lies on the couch waiting for me to get done with our baby’s night routine. If she starts crying in her sleep while we’re awake and getting stuff done, I always try to get her back to sleep which takes some patience and time. My husband can’t put in the time and just picks her up and brings her out into the living room which completely wakes her up. Then I have to deal with her at night and put her to sleep while he goes off to sleep. When I finally told him to stop, he now waits for me to go and deal with her while he scrolls or he’ll go in the room and scroll while mindlessly rocking her crib and she’ll be crying in it. Finally it becomes 12am by the time I put her to bed again. I pump during this time while we watch a show or something. But now he’s just started going to sleep (apparently he’s tired after all the work) and he asked me why I need to pump while he’s awake. I should apparently be choosing the show/ movie to watch instead. I’m so frustrated. I’m just expected to handle everything together and he’s thinks he’s doing me a huge favour by holding our baby when she’s in a good mood. Ever since the baby was born our relationship has gone down the drain. I’m drowning and he just cannot do anything about it because work is everything. I’m grateful for that but I’m tired of being the only parent here. ",

"I've been living more or less the same day for 7 months. I'm tired. I reached out for p4ofessuonal help even before I gave birth bc I knew my depression and anxiety would worsen. Every time I fail, I lose my will to live a little more. 

When I first got pregnant back in July 2023, they told me I had some abnormal cells. I'd need a biopsy after birth. I missed my postpartum  appts bc I was just too beat to go. I finally went and it seemed like things were starting to look up, st least healthwise. I missed the 1st appt bc I had no sitter (no one is willing to help) and couldn't get my stroller open. I was 3 mins late. I missed my 2nd app today bc they closed my location for construction and I had no idea. 

It feels like the stars are lining up to give me a way put. If I pass from cancer, no one will blame me. They'll call me a fighter. I don't think I'm going to the dr again. I think I finally see an end to this running prank of a life. 

I'm only venting right now. It's hard enough for me to discuss my feelings anymore. After doing PPD test after PPD test for absolutely nothing, I've given up hope. I have q psych appt tomorrow that I may have a sitter for (no telehealth for new patients).

I love my kids, but I'm ruining their lives. I'm trying so hard and just spinning me wheels. I have a baby that has refused to nap for nearly a month and cries all day in my arms so I can't even type this now. I hope it's all over quickly. ",

Sometimes I feel great and excited to meet our baby, other times I feel completely disconnected, and then other times I panic that this is the wrong decision and I shouldn’t have children.

"Hey.

I’m 29 years old and have four small children (ages 7, 4, 2, and 5 months). I had pretty easy recoveries with my first three babies, but since having my youngest son, I have been in a mental health crisis.

For me, it started within a month of my son being born but I didn’t realize what was happening until a few months postpartum, and I delayed reaching out for help.

My PPD/PPA is marked my extreme sadness and anxiousness, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, panic attacks that sometimes last for hours, difficulty eating, intrusive (sometimes suicidal) thoughts, and hopelessness.

The depression and anxiety has been exacerbated by several life stressors. My husband has been battling cancer for two years, and he was recently diagnosed with a second (unrelated) cancer. Also, our son was born with a heart defect and stayed in NICU for 9 days and at my 6 week postpartum checkup, I found out I was in the “precancerous stages” of cervical cancer.

These have been the darkest days of my life. I’ve lost 20lbs in two months. I’m blessed to have a strong support system from my husband, parents and older sister. I’m currently meeting with a therapist weekly and taking medication (Lexapro) to aid in my recovery.

I thought I would be better by now. It feels like the mental anguish is stretching on without end. Between the feelings of hopelessness, the panic attacks, and the intrusive thoughts, most days it feels like I’m all alone and things won’t ever get better.

I’m thankful I found this forum.

Thank you for taking the time to hear a little of my story. I hope to make connections with other women who have made it through to the other side. �",
"I am curious if any individuals in this subreddit have found any relief from their PPD symptoms after stopping breastfeeding? A little backstory, I’ve been breastfeeding for 7 months (we combo feed with formula, but it’s usually mostly breastmilk) and I got my period back a few months ago. It was unexpected, but fairly normal for the first couple cycles. This cycle however, has been a complete nightmare. I’ve always been very sensitive to hormone changes and have struggled with PMS, to the point where I believe it could be PMDD but my doctor refused to diagnose me because I did not have any suicidal thoughts/ideations. At this point, I’ve had severe PMS symptoms for 3 weeks straight on top of postpartum depression and I feel like I’m losing my mind. Pregnancy test negative, and I’ve been informed by multiple sources that hormones while breastfeeding can delay your period. But at this point, there is no end in sight to my PMS so I’m considering ending my breastfeeding journey. I feel like I need to let it out and hear from anyone who may have had a similar experience, did stopping breastfeeding give you any relief whatsoever??",
"im 4 days postpartum and in the TRENCHES right now. i have never felt like this in my life but today has been the worst. i was sitting on the couch and went into a full blown panic attack out of nowhere, it almost made me throw up i was hyperventilating so much my lips started turning blue and i started to choke and was borderline pulling my hair out (my baby was in another room when this happened) it took me probably around 45 minutes to calm down, the reason i cant tell what it is is because afterwards the only thing that helped keep me calm was my baby.. im getting so sick because of this i can feel it taking the worst physical toll on my body. i was also doing fine healing down there until today i started passing blood clots again idk if thats normal but im just so far from okay. and i have such a good life and everything has gone so well i dont know why this is happening but i just cant take it and idk what to do.",
"I, 23F had my son at 19. My gynecologist and I stopped getting along after I explained to him that I feel like I have postpartum depression. It was after I gave birth, (about 3 months) and I came in the office looking for answers, which I rarely do. 

I tend to mask in public, so as he entered the room I smiled and he took a seat. When I came to him about PPD he said, “Well, you don’t really look that depressed.” I could feel the defeat. He then proceeds to ask, “Have you ever been diagnosed with depression?” I said no, and as I tried to explain that I have always been depressed, he cuts me off and says that I have what they call, “baby blues.” 

Needless to say, I accepted it and tried to figure out myself. It’s an everyday battle; as I am a single parent and I want to learn to work on myself as well. ",

"I’m 24 years old, I’m 5’8 and weigh 220 pounds,

I feel like I’m the most disgusting ugly creature that god has ever created. 

I feel like I can’t get a control over myself and my weight, I know what I’m supposed to do. 
I know how to intermittently fast, 
I know i should go to the gym. But god I’m tired of making excuses for myself 

I have two boys under the age of 3, I’m constantly awake , I have almost no help when it comes to them. And I feel like I just can’t stop eating. 

When I do eat, I have so much freaking guilt. 

It’s like I constantly think about how I should feed my children or husband instead of me then I end up eating more and more and I feel like I can’t stop

Then my father and mother in law start complaining telling me I eat too much. And my father in law wants to show me work out videos.

My husband looks at beautiful small petite Asian women (which I look nothing like.)

And I feel like I don’t belong in this body and I’m so embarrassed and ashamed I let myself get this way, and I’m ashamed that I don’t have the energy to help myself. I looked into GLP-1s and they’re too expensive and I can’t help but hyper focus that they’re a magical drug, when in reality it only works with hard work gym, etc. 

I don’t even know what the point of this post is, I feel so alone and I really wish I had someone to talk to about this. All I have is my husband and he just tells me not to worry too much, I feel so gross. ",
"I’m getting more angry by the moment. Yesterday, I went to my counseling session and on the way home almost ran over my 6yo boy. He rode his sled down the driveway and into the bushes at the end. I was worried about if my van would make it up the driveway and was contemplating how much I should accelerate or just ease up into the driveway. I was so mad and scared he had done this. I had specifically told ALL the kids no sleds and no shovels (they leave the snow shovels out in the yard and lose them when it snows). 
My daughters 15, and 13 were supposed to be watching the kids. The 15 said she had checked on the boys outside every few minutes and didn’t realize he had gotten the sled. I believe her but I was so shaken and sad yesterday and last night.  
I’m going to counseling to feel better, not to come home and almost run over my own kid. 

So this morning I want to go to the gym and I am scared to leave the kids at the house. I can take 2 small ones to the gym daycare and then at 11 is parent teacher conferences. My husband is working out of town. So he wasn’t here last night to help with kids and he is not here this morning. I texted him and told him I was scared to leave the house with the girls watching the kids. He thought it would be ok if I just took the baby and the 6yo to the gym. But what about the other kids? So I suggested maybe I should stay home and do a home workout instead. The intensity won’t be the same and the kids will interrupt me and pester me while I’m working out. I’m doing a 6 wk workout challenge so I have to work out.  
It’s not fair I am left at home to figure this out. This always happens to the SAHM. If I was a man I would have a wife and I could just leave when I wanted and go have my workout and not be bothered to worry about the kids. 

Yesterday, we had a long conversation before he left. He asked me if I want to leave or divorce him bc I keep telling him that he deserves someone better than me. I just want to disappear. He asked me what would make me happy. I told him I would like to somehow quietly extricate myself from him and the kids. They don’t need me and he just needs someone different than me. 
I honestly can’t think of anything good about myself. I feel like I am worse this week than I was last week.

"As the title states, this is just becoming too much. Dealing with PPD/ PPA is a struggle on its own, but dealing with a partner who just puts you down in the midst of it is just overwhelming. Today I was yelled at and told I don’t clean and am always sleeping. I clean as much as I can, but it gets hard with a velcro baby (he’s out of a job right now so he has all the free time to clean). I nap when the baby naps because I do all the night wakes and frankly, it’s exhausting being so mentally drained. Oh, and on top of that he called me fat. I’ve been struggling with my weight and it’s been impossible to lose any since I’m breastfeeding. I can only imagine how much easier things would be if I had a partner that was loving and supportive during this time. I’m trying my best to keep it together today. ",
"My life has honestly been a complete whirlwind since my second baby was born. Like the day she was born my parents got into a tiff and have been talking about divorce since, we’ve lost several friends (self harm or freak accidents - I’ve literally attended five funerals in six months), my bother and his wife are handling infidelity so I help watch their kids and I changed jobs shortly after returning from maternity leave. 

All of that to say, my entire “village” fell apart when my daughter was born and I’ve been struggling silently for 8 months. My partner is the best man I could imagine and is doing everything to help me during this time. I’ve fought postpartum rage, but now I’m starting to think I’m battling PPD too. I don’t know where to turn. Idk if medication would help at this point. I’m breastfeeding so the idea of taking something every day has had me a little concerned. I also don’t know what doctor to talk to. I have seen my OB since my 6 week check up so do I go to my primary care doctor? I have felt burnout, overwhelmed and like I’m a failing mom and spouse. I have a two year old that I’m trying my best to be present and happy for but it’s just becoming so difficult. ",
"i’m sorry if this is a mess i am not in the best headspace. my s/o says he understands how i feel and what i deal with but i feel like he really doesn’t. we got in a fight tonight and instantly he resorts to insults, calling me lazy, saying i dont don’t do anything and that ive been a b*tch all day. it hurts. it’s defeating. i feel like a shell of a woman at this point. i try SO hard to do as much as i can throughout the day. my baby is teething and has been a handful so cleaning and staying on top of the cleaning has been hard. i work from home and watch my son while i work which is soso hard when he’s being fussy esp on a time crunch with deadlines. i’ve been working extra hours this week just so we can at least feel a little load taken off because money has been tight. i feel like ive done so so so well at acknowledging and thanking my s/o when he steps up and helps out so i can take a break but he says i don’t. i told him i was having a hard time with our son but not once was i rude to him and i have people that can attest to that. idek. i’m just exhausted. i’m tired of trying so hard just to get shit on and told i’m not doing good enough. it’s never good enough. i don’t know what more i can do. i communicate, i work hard, i give him as long of a break as he needs, i typically handle dinner, cleaning, it takes up my entire day with maybe 30-40 minutes after we get my son down for me to do basic self care. im stretched thin and it still doesn’t fucking matter. he swears it’s okay but the second we get in a fight suddenly it’s a problem. suddenly i’ve been a cunt all day. suddenly i do nothing for us but sit on my ass. suddenly work isn’t work bc i don’t work outside and i should treat work like a break and enjoy it. it’s like if im anything but happy it’s a problem and im NOT HAPPY so how am i supposed to put on a face like i am??? i feel empty and tired and dead inside. i feel like my body STILL isn’t mine. i feel like i don’t get to be an individual person, im just a mother and a girlfriend otherwise im a horrible person for enjoying anything outside of that and my s/o makes it very apparent that he doesn’t like me exploring interests although he encourages it, when we fight suddenly my hobbies are taking away from spending time with him and talking to him as if he doesn’t sit on his phone the second he gets home or plays video games. im damned if i do and damned if i don’t and i can’t fucking stand it anymore.

"What is emotional attachment 

I heard not having this to your freshly newborn child is normal and takes months, what happens when it gets to a year of the child’s life and there’s no emotional attachment 

I feel love for my partner and unborn child and my one year old I don’t feel it 

When o was pregnant with him I didn’t feel excitement or love like I do for my second unborn son and my partner

"I’m currently 10 months pp and been struggling with ppd/ppa since 3 months pp. I’ve been in a maternal mental health program and have been on lexapro and Zoloft and have been unsuccessful with both. My psychiatrist recently had me do gene sight testing and it showed that I’m genetically predisposed to not tolerate many medications, only 3 to be exact. I’m currently tapering off of Zoloft and will be starting Viibryd soon. I’m wondering if anyone else has been on this medication and can share their experience!

"I am 4 months postpartum and have 3 older kids (5, 8, 9.5) from a previous marriage as well. I’m hitting a wall and feel like I don’t love my husband or kids anymore. My baby feels like someone else’s baby that I’m going through the motions with and taking care of. My big kids don’t listen, struggle with respect, and generally are hard to parent. I want out of my life and to have a re-do starting before I had kids. I don’t know what to do. Me struggling is met mostly with anger and my husband makes it all about himself. ",
"My fiancé works away up north every other week for a week. I am on Mat leave so I am home alone with baby every week he is gone. I have Anxiety and PPD but I aside from that, I’m not sure if this is normal. 

I am madly in love with my fiancé, obviously. He loves me and our new baby (7months) so incredibly much and take such great care of us. I literally cannot say enough good things about this man. So I’m not sure if this is my fight or flight response but especially when he goes to work I have full on panic attacks (had one today before taking him to the airport) and I just have this horrible intrusive irrational I know, thoughts that he will find someone better at work or not miss me or just not want to be with me and leave me. I cannot stop thinking about him 24/7 and it’s almost impossible being alone every week with baby when he’s gone. I have no family here, friends that are available to visit (as they work), and I live outside the city so it’s a bit of a drive for some. 

It’s so bad, that I have a hard time going for walks the same way we go for walks when he’s home because it reminds me of him and I miss him more, or I don’t step foot downstairs because that’s where we always have our movies nights, I have to take his stuff off the counter in the bathroom because seeing it makes me miss him more. I also ruminate on the hours and days he’ll be gone still. I’ll count and work myself up and just get sad. It’s like an obsession, but I’m not crazy in that way. Lol. 

I love him so much and I know I am co dependant but this is so incredibly hard and I know I am in the wrong. How do I get over these feelings? It’s like my brain thinks when life is so amazing and I have someone who loves me so much it’s too good to be true… ",

"Hey, so I've experienced this multiple times before I had a baby, but I think postpartum is triggering this to happen again. I have moments where real people don't 'feel real' to me anymore, typically people who have hurt me. I'm starting to feel like that with my baby daddy. I was thinking of him not too long ago, and suddenly every memory I have of him feels more like a dream. Like it never actually happened. I can barely remember what he looks like in person. I can't remember any other sense, like touch, smell, etc (I used to be able to). I'm not quite sure how to explain it further than that.

I have experienced this with small things here and there, too. Like I'll text someone, then forget I did, then think about it later in the day except I'm not sure if I actually texted them or if I dreamt that I did. I'd say about half the time it was a dream, half the time reality.

At first I wasn't too worried, because I just figured it was a side effect and the immense stress I'm in and sleep deprivation. But feeling like my baby daddy is not real is putting me through even more stress. I'm not sure if this would be considered derealization, or something else. So if this sounds familiar to you, please let me know! I'm not in a stable enough situation financially to afford therapy.",
"I am just over 4 months postpartum. At my 6 week checkup I was diagnosed with PPD. I have since been on daily antidepressants. 
Lately, I think I am starting to get postpartum anxiety. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me. I have this irrational fear that someone is going to SA my 4 month old. I don’t trust any one. I think it might have been triggered by seeing TikTok videos and Facebook stories. I am just absolutely terrified someone is going to hurt her. I don’t know how to handle this. I feel like I’m going crazy constantly thinking of this. On top of this I feel like I’m constantly being watched. I have the urge to run up my stairs at night as if someone is going to get me or her. 

I don’t know if I need my antidepressants adjusted or if I need to see a therapist. I feel like I’m going crazy. ",
"I’ve been struggling with postpartum depression. My son is 9 weeks. And sometimes all I can think about is going into the bathroom and just ending everything. I won’t. There’s no reason for me to I have a good life. A loving husband. But that thought is just there. 

I have friends. Or at least thought I did. Everyone likes to use me as a therapist but whenever I call them to talk or send them a message I get left on read or ignored when I really need someone because I’m having a hard day. It’s so hard feeling like I’m alone even though I know I’m not. 

I love my son I really do and I want to get over this but Zoloft makes me feel sick everytime I take it. I don’t know what’s wrong to do anymore. ",

"TRIGGER WARNING: mention of loss

My marriage feels like it’s sinking. I’m 2 months post partum today. I have 4 daughters, ages 5, 3, 2, and the 2 month old. I have had postpartum depression with all of my pregnancies, including my first pregnancy where I had a stillbirth at 38 weeks. I have noticed symptoms I dealt with previously making an appearance again. I feel like when my house is a mess I can’t breathe. I feel like I can’t do anything without my newborn. I really wanted to be able to breastfeed this time. With my first, I could never get her to latch and didn’t have any idea how to pump at the time. With my second, I breastfed her and bottle fed her breastmilk until 8 months when my supply disappeared because I was pregnant with our third. With my third, I don’t even know how long I tried breastfeeding her before I gave up for my mental health. She was my only delivery without an epidural, and unfortunately I think because it was so traumatic for me, I didn’t bond with her as much and that affected my breastfeeding journey with her. My newest has been difficult to even try to get her to take a bottle with breastmilk in it. She only wants boob. She won’t take a pacifier. I’m not against formula at all, but it breaks my heart to even think about stopping. But I also feel relief when I think about stopping. I feel worthless. My husband has always treated me wonderfully. He’s always there for me when I need him. But I know I’ve been nasty to him lately, but I feel like it’s not me talking. I feel like my family would be better off without me. I don’t want to take antidepressants because I dont believe in medications. I know there’s people who believe that’s the only way to get through things, but I know there has to be another option for me? I feel like I’m single handedly tearing my family apart. My 5 year old went to school and was best friends with a little girl whose parents were divorced and she told me today that she doesn’t want our family to end up like that girls family. � I broke down right then and there. We try so hard to not have arguments in front of our daughters but she was listening when we didn’t know she was. I just feel like all I feel lately is rage or guilt. I don’t know how to feel happy. ",
"I'll be 3 months postpartum on 11/3. This is our 3rd baby after a long hiatus, our other 2 are 9 and 7, so it's been a while since battling these feelings. We also live on our own in another state with very disconnected families, so there is no help outside of my husband coming home from work.
I don't know why, but since having our daughter, I immediately jump to thoughts  of divorce when I start feeling alone and down and I don't know what to do to stop it. I'm waiting on my next therapy appointment but I always feel gaslit when talking about postpartum depression symptoms.
My husband is a wonderful guy, it seems like he's trying his best, but his best doesn't feel like enough right now, and I hate that I feel this way. I work a full time job from home and I have the baby with me, we don't have a sitter or daycare. I feel like I'm working 2 jobs when he's gone, then my older kids come home from school and I juggle all of the kids and dogs and cat and try figuring out food, homework, cleaning, etc. It's a lot.
When he comes home I try passing the baby to him as she's like velcro to me, I can't put her down unless she's napping, and I end up with her repeatedly for the rest of the evening, even when I'm not breastfeeding. I'm so emotionally drained and feel like I'm pulling all of the weight with the baby, which I know isn't 100% true, but God it feels like it. And it just makes me want to pack up and leave. I almost did once...

I am currently 4 weeks postpartum and I’m really struggling with ppd. My baby was born at 34 weeks and I still haven’t been able to take him home yet. It’s so hard being an hour away from him all the time. Sometimes I stay with him but only for a few days at a time and then I head home for a few days. He has svt and his heart rate keeps going crazy out of nowhere and they are trying to get it under control before he gets sent home. I know I’m not the only one who is going through this. Are there any good support groups out there? My doctor wants me to start therapy but my boyfriend has to drive my car to work so I can’t drive to therapy all the time.

"Does it bother anyone else when people refer to it as just “postpartum”?  

Maybe it’s just me but I get a little irritated when people say things like “do you have postpartum?” Or “I had really bad postpartum with my first” 
The word “depression” is implied but I dislike when it’s omitted because it makes it feel like a dirty word or something. Or maybe it makes it feel shameful. 


I don’t think depression is shameful and I don’t think we can adequately fight something that we don’t name.

"I am 3 months PP and my ppd has improved significantly but I’m still struggling with being alone. I’ve adjusted and better accepted the days my husband is working, and I’ve found weekends give me something during the week to really look forward to. But I really find myself spiraling when my husband wants to use his off time away doing something else. It’s really not often, I will give him that. But I feel like I really need him right now, especially since 5-6 days a week he’s working. Having him take a Sunday away from me really sends me over the edge and I can’t exactly figure out how to overcome it.  ",
"This last week has been tough. I switched meds and they had some serious side effects: suicide ideation. I made a list of my belongings and what should be done with them upon my passing. I haven’t told my husband this but we did have a talk about going to an emergency room if I felt I needed it. That the kids would be ok at the house and we would sort things out. 
On Tuesday The kids ate a whole box of Nilla Wafers I bought for them on Sunday. I was so mad so I”quit” being a mom. I told them I am not cooking or cleaning or parenting any of them for a while. I have older girls so they have been taking care of things. My husband is out of town. He is working through his own hardships and is trying to get us more financially stable. 

He sent me a reel last night about a lady who said she was trying to do everything ie feminism and live up to the hype of social media. She said she “thinks” men want a nurturing partner to produce offspring and create a peaceful home.  
So I asked him why he married me and he can’t give me an answer that isn’t tied to me being a mother. I kept asking and he said it was because I was kind and loving and wanted to improve myself as a person. He also commented on my looks quoting the Song of Solomon.  
So I told him that I guess I am looking for a specific answer that he can’t give me. Other than I’m “nice and kind”. That just affirmations to me that I am not “special” or “unique” in any way. He could meet up with any number of women and determine they are nice and kind and want to improve themselves. His answer just affirms to me that I am replaceable and he can find happiness with someone else who is not me. Someone who is smarter, prettier, funny, and better at everything else. 

Tell me I am not wrong for wanting a better answer than just he likes me for “being giving and helping other people”. 
What kind of an answer is that? I know I’m not the prettiest and my body isn’t what it used to be. I have lots of grey hair that has appeared within the last year. My face is tired and saggy. I’m not educated and don’t have any marketable skills. I’m just a SAHM and I don’t even do a good job at that. I don’t know what he wants from me but what he is saying is not helping.  ",
"Hello Reddit. I am a first time mom to a 1 year old girl. I am single mom. I have been since I was 6 weeks PP. My daughter’s father is abusive so I officially left him for good when my daughter was 7 months old. But he’s never helped with anything. Not financially, not emotionally, just nothing. I had to get a PFA against him cuz he’s psycho. Well, the reason for my post is because I’m still struggling. I find myself getting frustrated and angry and losing patience much faster than I ever would’ve before having my baby. She is perfect at daycare and when my family watches her. But for me she is a nightmare. She screams a lot, she fights me all the time, and just doing what toddlers do. I feel like a horrible mom because I get so frustrated and I end up yelling or crying or just throwing something when I separate myself. Have any mamas dealt with this? I want help. I want to be a better mom for my baby girl and not wanting to be like this anymore. I never wanted to be a single mom, but this is the card I’ve been dealt. When I ask the women in my family for help, they just tell me to suck it up and deal with it cuz “nobody told me to have a kid” and to figure it out. I love my baby girl so much. She is my entire world. But I feel like I should already have a handle on how to deal with her by now since we’re a year in. I never got over my postpartum and I’m still trying to cope with the trauma from her father. I just want to know if I’m the only one who feels like this ",

"My Dad recently made a ""joke"" that has been hurting me ever since. 

For context, I'm 19 and I had moved out at 18 with my boyfriend at the time (now ex). We both had stable incomes. After I got pregnant, I lost my job and a couple months later he lost his. After we found out I was pregnant, the relationship got very toxic. I don't want to go too into detail, because it's not relevant to what my dad said, but to put it simply, we lost our apartment and broke up and now I live with my parents again. My baby is currently 4 months, and my ex doesn't do really anything at all to help provide. My brother helped me out a lot with watching my baby for the first couple of months, especially since I had a csection. I appreciate all the help, but one thing I struggle with is feeling disconnected from my baby and not feeling like a mother. I was insecure about my ability to parent and thought that my baby didn't recognize me and would think that my mom is his. My brother would also make jokes whenever my baby would cry whenever I'd hold him and say that my son didn't like me.

My Dad told me a couple weeks ago that my brother spends so much time with him that my son thinks he's his mommy. Then he made a joke that my son is secretly calling him mommy behind my back. Idk if this sounds like not a big deal, but that hurt me a lot, especially with everything I was already thinking about myself. It still hurts me now and makes it hard for me to ask for help even though I know I need it. I feel ashamed for the situation I'm in and feel like a terrible mother.

Sometimes I regret having a baby. And it hurts so much to write out because I'm holding my baby right now. I love him so much, I really do. But I'm tired of everything I'm going through and people making me feel worse for it. I hate that my ex can live freely and I can't. I feel like I'm a horrible mom and my baby deserves more. I'm tired of crying in front of my baby but having to smile through it bc I don't want him to see how sad I really am. My best friend made a joke too and asked me, ""What kind of impression are you giving your baby by couch surfing between your parent's houses?"" Nobody seems to give a shit about how I feel and they decide my situation is just funny.",
"Hi,

I am not part of y'all community, but recently my friend and his partner had a baby. She had the baby a month early, and then the mom had to stay in the hospital for 8 days after the birth. 
She had preeclampsia. 
Fast-forward.. the baby is a month old. 
My friend reaches out to give me an update on the whole family..
She's depressed, again. He mentions that she wants to kill herself. That she would rather work than take care of the kids, but they cannot financially afford that because she also doesn't really want to work. 

She struggled when their first child was born 5 years ago. This time i feel as if she is struggling more. 
It pains me to hear that my friend is struggling and doesn't know how to help his partner. She isn't communicating with him and telling him what she needs. She isn't reaching out for any mental health services. 

So i guess i am asking if anyone in the Columbus, OH area knows of any good postpartum care resources that i can forward to them?
Or any good care resources in general to help her and the family. 
She didnt use a doula, she went to the hospital. ",

"FTM in early 30’s, LO is 3 months old and I feel like it’s getting tougher and tougher each day. I am very sleep deprived and ever since he was born I never experienced that sleep of at least 3 hours and so. I can say he is a very difficult baby. We’re still up 4-6x per night. I just got used to it I guess, preparing myself everyday to a battle (that I guess will never end). 

So during my 6 weeks postpartum check-up, I was referred to behavioral health which I still haven’t process until now, they diagnosed me with PPD plus PP mood disturbance, I just told them the guilt that I felt when my milk supply got lost and I can’t do anything about it but honestly it is more beyond that, like I really can’t cope up with this role, I feel like Im failing, I feel like shit. Everytime my LO cries I just really want to scream and sometimes I really do scream at him and that scares me and feeling terrible and guilty after. I mean I really do love him but this is so hard.
I never had thoughts of harming my baby but many times to myself, I usually tell my baby and myself that “Lord please just let me die if this will be my life every single day night.” And sometimes I do feel like I just really want to hang myself, it’s just so overwhelming like I don’t know what I’m doing wrong each time my baby cries and I do feel jealous with mothers who have easy babies. 

Baby daddy says that he doesn’t believe in PPD and that’s one big factor as well. Plus family members live nearby the area but not single one of them offers help nor ask me if I am okay or doing fine instead they always mom-shame me and bash me with all the ways how I handle my baby. To add up, yes my mom offered help but I refused because we’re not just okay, she used to abused me physically when I was a child up to my college years so I promised myself I will never let her touch my child. 

I know I said a lot but I am still lost for words actually. I am just so heartbroken and crying while Im typing this. �",

"Please help me. I keep getting so irrationally angry at my 7 almost 8m old. I can’t control it. It’s mainly at night when they wake up and are just crying and fussing and doing the fake type cry they do. Tonight I’ve been telling her to shut the fuck up and just swearing and raising my voice and I want to just throw her off the bed, but I obviously won’t. But I’m so scared because I’m already shouting at a baby and swearing. She’s doesn’t seem phased by it. I’m so angry and short tempered during the day too with my husband and anyone else that’s around. I’ve got a 4 yo and I’m finding myself raising my voice to him more and more. I just can’t control my emotions any more and I’m angry and I just hit myself in the head and punch myself in the head when my baby is like this as I’m so angry. I’m too scared to go to the doctor incase they can social  services. ",
"So to start with some context, I have recently diagnosed audhd and I have had depression and anxiety from a very young age. I've gotten that under control with the right medications and therapy, but not without a handful of bumps along the way. I am so lucky to be married to my best friend and to be starting a family with him. He is kind and patient and funny and just the best I could've ever asked for.

I have had some turmoil with my in-laws within the last 5 years or so that began when we overheard my (now) husband's mother scream crying that she didn't want him to marry me a few months into our engagement. (Now I know I'm not nearly as wonderful as my husband; I am tarnished with childhood trauma and I'm working hard to prevent spreading any of it to my son.) But she was a big part of my childhood (my husband and I were neighbors and good friends growing up), and I looked to her for wisdom and advice and she was a real inspiration to me. When she let out her true feelings that she didn't like me, my world shattered and I instantly threw up invisible barriers to protect myself. So we act totally fine and catch up like all is well when we see eachother, but I can only handle seeing the in-laws maybe 2 times a month. By the end of each get together I am drained of all emotional energy. They are inherently good people, but they are in their own little bubble they've established, with very few friends or family involved in their lives. It's hard to be one of the few people they have around, especially since my husbands brother moved across country last year. It feels like they're more reliant on us to fill that gap wince they're empty nesters now. When we slowly started to come over less, they seemed mostly fine with that, and the relationship with them felt much less rocky.

I just gave birth to our beautiful boy last week and I have never been more happy in my life. Truly, I have never loved my husband more than when I see him being a daddy. I have never felt more purpose and contentment with my life. 

However, the second our baby was born, my MIL has swept in to try to be with us as often as she can. It is my biggest pet peeve when someone tiptoes around their real intentions as if I'm dumb or complacent. My MIL is insisting on coming by everyday to drop off something to ""help"" us with. That sounds like the right thing that people should do for new parents, sure, and I'd love it if she'd been this way the last 5 years. But she has shown time and time again that she doesn't like me for her son and thus, this ""help"" feels transactional and wrong. I'd even let that go if she hadn't already blatantly disrespected us and our boundaries with the baby.

It's often debated what boundaries parents set, and if they're reasonable or not. I made it clear throughout this pregnancy 1:do not kiss the baby by any means and dont put your hands on his face 2:do not invite yourself or others over.

My in-laws kissed my son at least 30 times and when confronted said ""oh we agree babies shouldn't be kissed on the face, but we just did the top of his head"". Then I was told she invited aunts and other people to come see ""her baby"".
Now I respect that she's his grandmother and she has every right to be excited and to love him. 
I've been emotional as hell since this boy was born and it is almost all joy. But then the stress of having to set boundaries with this difficult person that I can never fully cut off has put me into a spiral. Every time she messages I feel my chest swell with anxiety and anger and I end up sobbing uncontrollably and screaming like a banshee at how mad I am at her. I then cry from how guilty I feel for being so upset when this should be the happiest time of my life. My husband has been the perfect dad and spouse and I've been making things so difficult but I can't control my emotions. My baby's eyes and my husband's hugs bring me back to earth but having a newborn is already hard on a relationship. I don't want to also have to be the bad guy with my MIL because ultimately, while I'd rather not have her in my life, she is my love's mother and I do respect that bond.

I am sleep deprived and my body doesn't feel like my own. I don't feel like myself and I miss who I was pre-pregnancy. But I'm also so in love with being a mom. It's an absolute Rollercoaster. I'm joining a post-partum program soon, but I'm afraid a great deal of healing will only be able to be done if I confront my trauma and issues with my MIL. I'm going to offend her and probably mess things up for a little while but for my own sanity I think these feelings need to be addressed with the source.

That was a lot but I needed to sort out my thoughts and vent. I already feel a little better now, whether or not anyone responds to this.

Thoughts? I'm not opposed to hearing that I'm a pos daughter-in-law because I have considered that theory as well. I just love my little family so much and I want to keep all negativity put of this bubble that we're forming while we adjust to our new lives together. TIA.",
"I just recently posted on here a few days ago about being burnt out, but here’s more to it. 

My bf and i just got a night off on monday night from the baby. It was amazing and i thought it would help, and it did but now it’s all started up again. I cry randomly. I get frustrated more easily. 

For more context, my bf works until 11 at night and that’s a lot for us. The baby usually has a sleep schedule and starts to sleep at around 9 and wakes up early. so us going to bed at such a late time we get no sleep. 

i am dealing with hormones from my birth control too. Every time i have to go get him i just feel this weight on my chest and dread. 

We don’t know how to handle this. We are both tired. 

We also have an easy baby, as everyone else says. So i guess i put myself in the mindset that it should be easy mentally. ",
"Hey all! I’m pregnant with my second baby. First time around I had PPD for about 6/7 months. I’ve been talking to my OB and Midwife about options this time around and my Midwife said this is a fairly new drug that can be taken the 1st two weeks after giving birth and has shown some promise.

I’m just curious to hear if anyone has experience taking it? Did it work for you? 

It just got FDA approval in 2023 so not sure if anyone’s really had a chance with it �",
"Idk how I’m feeling towards my partner anymore. He’s not a bad guy. But I notice he sometimes interacts with our daughter and sometimes he doesn’t. He just got back home from work, lays down I told him she’s looking at him with a sad pout. And he’s like I’m sleeping. It makes me sad. I already feel overwhelmed at times. I just don’t know. ",
"I just need to vent. 
Ever since having my baby I feel like I no longer matter. Aside from my husband and maybe two of my friends, all communication is about the baby. My mom isn’t around, my dad uses my child as a social media prop- coming over for 15 minutes a week to hold/take photos and leave. My in-laws are the “come over if you need us” kind of people, and my mother in law is 12 hours away. She would help if she could, but distance makes that understandably difficult. 
I had a pretty traumatic birth, and my baby and I both had complications from it. He was in the NICU for almost a week and I was in a specialty care unit for a few days. My husband had only a week of paternity leave, and it was all spent while we were hospitalized. I’m alone all day in the house tending to my newborn without any support. I feel like my own basic needs (bathing, eating) are falling to the wayside because of this lack of support. I’m scared to welcome people into my home because the housekeeping and self care have been so lax and I don’t want to be judged for it. My husband helps as much as he can after work and at night, but I dread the days because I feel like I’m constantly in survival mode. 

I just have to believe that it gets better. 
I love my son so much and am doing my best to keep him clean, fed, and safe above everything else. But I was expecting a shred of empathy at the very least from friends and family, and I’m so disappointed in how alone I feel. ",
"Sorry if it’s a bit confusing on the way I write but it’s my first time.

Hi everyone, I’m a mom in my 20s with a 5-month-old baby. I’m currently a stay-at-home mom (SAHM), and while I absolutely love my baby and would never do anything to hurt them, I’m feeling overwhelmed, lost, and constantly crying myself to sleep. Lately, I’ve been battling suicidal thoughts, but I need to clarify: I would never harm my baby—it’s just that this new life is starting to crush me emotionally.

Financially, I feel like I’m drowning. We’ve always been careful with our money, but now my husband checks our budget every week. It used to be once a month, but lately, it’s gotten so much more frequent, and I feel like I’m being micromanaged. I know saving is important, but it’s getting harder to breathe under the constant pressure. I miss having financial freedom, and I’m beginning to resent being a SAHM. I want to work, to feel like I can make my own money and decisions again but I guess this comes down to getting married where it’s no longer “ My” but “ Our money”.

One of the reasons we haven’t opted for child care is that it doesn’t sit well with us. There have been constant news/stories about daycare centers overdosing kids with patches or drugs to calm them down, and we’re not keen on the idea of someone else teaching or influencing our child about things we don’t want them to be part off . It’s just unsettling.

I probably know why I’m feeling this way but this is a background story. Growing up, I had a very different lifestyle. My mom was a widow and worked hard to provide for us to the point her business boomed, she also hired help—nannies,stay at home helpers —to manage things. I never had to do much in terms of chores, and I always had people taking care of me when I was young . I know that sounds privileged, and it is, but that’s the life I grew up with( my grandparents are against the idea of having people around to do houseworks and stuff coz they think it’s gonna make us lazy.
). 
When I finished my degree in pharmacy (which was more of my mom’s dream than mine), I decided I wanted to live my own life and I was encouraged by my uncle (It’s probably a way for him to make me independent). I told my mom I was moving to a different country, and I asked for her help with just the processing part like plane ticket and atleast $2k pocket money and that’s it—I wanted to do the rest on my own. It worked. I didn’t want to rely on her money, and I managed to build my life from there.I’m a nurse now and manage to pay all my bills by working 2 or 3 jobs while I was studying.

Fast forward to now, and it feels like I’ve gone from being independent to completely dependent again. My husband sometimes jokes that I should manage to take care of our baby because my mom raised four kids, but I have to remind him that my mom had help. And now I’m pressured that he’s talking about a second child,him and almost all the people around me.
He does his share of housework because I told him from the beginning that I wouldn’t be doing it all alone unless we were rich enough to hire help. But lately, I’m feeling resentful. He listens to podcasts and videos about parenting, but I wish he would focus more on searching how to physically help with the baby. He works from home three days a week, I just want him to step up and I don’t want to be a nag or doesn’t want him to feel that I’m ordering him around . He doesn’t have initiatives. Instead, I have to ask him to do it, or remind him when it’s time for a bath.He constantly forgets about it and I feel like he doesn’t even know his own child’s routine. We talked about it and he started taking our baby out of our room with him every morning coz our baby wakes up early so he got time to play with her while I continue to sleep. 

I get that he might be under pressure, too, but if he expects me to stay at home for the next five years or more( which he expects me to be and do home schooling), he needs to level up financially. I’m not willing to live a life where we constantly struggle. His mom can’t help on weekdays, and my family isn’t in the country, so I’m feeling even more isolated.

I never thought being a SAHM would feel this suffocating or financially restricting. I love my baby, but I’m not loving this life, and I feel guilty about that. Has anyone else been through this? How did you cope with these feelings or find a way to gain more control over your life? Any advice would mean the world to me.

Thanks for reading.

Ps: I don’t really plan to spend in any material stuff but I just want the psychological aspect where I have money coming in my bank.We use the same credit card.",
"I am almost certain wife has PPA/PPR but she refuses to look into it or even read the descriptions of it I send her. It is our first LO. She insists she is the same person she was before, but she isn't. She's cold, cruel or indifferent to me (though she's slightly improved on this--from 100% cruel in all situations to being cruel only once a day but otherwise mostly indifferent--she did this, though, only after I gave her a mandate and deadline to stop screaming at me for leaving the microwave door ajar). I want to forgive her, but she gaslights me when I mention that her behavior is wrong and I can see in her body language that she still feels rage to me. (This from a woman who told me women use period pain as an excuse for their character flaws / bad behavior). 

I try to be positive and help her recover. Her mom babysat for an hour with pumped milk and we went to have a meal at her favorite cafe. 75% of the time she was on her phone looking for items for the baby. She buys countless things that even the doctors have told us we do not need (e.g. a billerubin test device even though baby is now at almost normal levels and the doctors say it will resolve in a day or two). In the first few days, she cost us thousands of dollars by running overdrafts without moving some money from savings and I can only alleviate this by hourly checking that she hasn't spent another $500 on something and overdrafted (I mentioned it to her and she says it's my responsibility but i cant press because she cant take it right now) meanwhile I am the real villain for forgetting to take out the trash. 

I'm up with the baby at night with her to burp baby, but she refuses to bottle feed so neither of us get significant sleep. (I also cook breakfast and clean and do diaper duty). She refuses to acknowledge the liberties her mom takes in our home (while MIL is also helping) and screams at me if I try to set healthy boundaries for MIL--such as not barging in unannounced while I am naked.

Ladies: what did your husband do to help pull you out of this cycle? I sat her down to watch her favorite comedy TV show yesterday while the baby was feeding and she couldn't even recall what the 20 minute episode was about because the whole time she was reading something about the best soaps to buy for baby (we already have 5+ designer soaps for babies and the doctor said there's nothing wrong with her skin and to keep using what we're using but just to wash with soap once or at most twice a week).

I'm thinking we can have a five minute dance off or something, but I've got to pull her up and out of this because she is destroying herself and our relationship too and I can't take this too much longer. I read somewhere that mental illness explains behavior, but it doesn't excuse it and there are / should be consequences. 

My latest idea is to try to get her to dance for 5 minutes...silly but I'm trying everything.

"I have a three month old boy who I’m recently starting to fall in love with. He is a VERY high needs baby and cries most of the time. Regardless of all the crying I luckily have begun to love every moment with him. This definitely was not the case until very recently. It was quite the opposite I thought my baby HATED me. But now I’m struggling deeply with ppd. Before getting pregnant I struggled with my mental health… I always have since I was a teenager. I’ve been hospitalized a few times and medicated on and off for years. I have shared with my boyfriend that im struggling a lot right now and he seems like he understands but then responds with “well, this was your dream to have a baby… so find a way to be happy” I continuously tell him that I’m allowed to struggle even though I wanted our child. Sometimes he seems understanding and then other days he seems mad at me for being so sad. He often tries to tell me that he’s having an equally hard time. But after carrying our child for 41 weeks and 3 days in my body having a 30+ hour labor and then going into septic shock from an infection from the delivery with coming to terms that I’m 25 and my body looks awful and my hair is falling out with a baby screaming 24/7…. Oh and not to mention exclusively breast pumping… I feel like things might be a little bit harder for me 
He works at a restaurant full time and I’m home with the baby alone. He also told me he’s starting to resent me for not being intimate with him. I have a uterine prolapse and I’m really uncomfortable in my own body right now which I’ve communicated but yet he still finds a way to pressure me or make me feel badly. I’m starting to resent him and feel like I made a mistake having a child with him. He’s by no means the only problem here… I struggle with rage right now and often scream at him or throw a dish or punch the wall… but he doesn’t seem to understand why I’m so broken on the inside right now

"Postpartum depression is like waking up having a list of things to do and when you open your eyes you instantly feel like you have been hit by a truck. Your brain feels mushy,  can't think clearly.  with a cloud of sadness over you. You try to plan our your day or get your baby on a schedule but it's so hard .. my mind can't function. The thoughts of My boyfriend and my baby don't need me, don't appreciate me, will be better off without me lingering in the back of your head all day. Your baby is crying for no reason at this point. baby is clean, freshly fed, burped swaddled, cuddled, and in the motion swing unsatisfied. Your boyfriend is upset because you are not the same person he met and this version of you is comfortable pushing him away because you would rather be alone and suffer than talk to him because you feel so hopeless and think he won't understand . All the basic life problems are feeling heavier and bigger. You wake up every day like why did I wake up today ...  and are barely hanging on a thread off of 2 hours of sleep the last two days .... but your baby still needs you and your boyfriend still is upset with you.  Your family is uneducated.  having postpartum depression is not like your average sad Joe. having postpartum is 10x bigger of a sadness and hopeless cloud. That feels like it lasts forever.  I Still wake up every feeding. I still clean the house and make our food, and I still provide for my family every day in any way I can,  I have a son and A boyfriend and I know my boys depend on me and don't fully fathom the hormonal fluctuations after giving birth and relearning the newest version of myself having postpartum is being aware of how you feel and what's going on with no cure. I understand why I feel the way I do and yet my brain and body still feel it.  If YOU are a boyfriend, or spouse, to a woman who is experiencing postpartum depression, or anxiety. Hug her today, remind her that it's going to be okay... This is a big adjustment learning ourselves again after not having to be pregnant anymore. Learning our baby. Relearning you.  It's A LOT of negative feelings that weigh beyond measure to a new mom, healing mom, or any mom. ",
"Hey guys. I’m new here, just had my baby girl 7 days ago. I wanted to just post here to get some feedback/ advice? (I do have an appointment booked with my therapist for next week also) 

So to start off, I had a pretty traumatic birthing experience. Long story short, I labored for 30+ hrs in the hospital, had some complications come up, and then ended up having an emergency c section. (Also relevant: I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past) 

Labor started Monday and I had her Wednesday. Then I had to kick into mom mode and figure out having a newborn and adapt to her while also now trying to recover from having a major abdominal surgery. (Very thankful for my husband because he was there the whole time, was the one that advocated for us and ended up saving our daughter’s life). 

Anyways, all that to say: my brain never had time to catch up and realize or comprehend what just happened. It’s now the following Tuesday and I’ve been having extremely intrusive thoughts (never to hurt my baby) but of ways that my baby COULD be hurt. To the point where I feel like leaving my bed is a danger. Now I try to move past these thoughts because I obviously can’t keep us in bed all day and I do get up and around but my problem is, once I slow down, they come back. And my anxiety is through the roof. Not only with the intrusive thoughts, just life in general. I have horrible anxiety when my husband goes to work (just feeling him gone hurts for some reason). In addition to the normal emotional roller coaster of crying because I love him and her so much. 

I keep myself busy to the point of constantly moving to do something. Doing laundry every day, pumping every couple of hrs, cleaning my breast pump tools, cleaning her bottles, feeding her, changing her, doing and catching up on my assignments (I’m also in school full time for masters), etc. So when I sit down (mainly at night when my hubby is sleeping and my brain won’t shut off, I panic and overthink and cry and worry and everything else under the sun. I dread night time coming because I know what is about to happen. Every day so far. It’s like I’m trying to stay busy to run from my mind. 

I don’t know where the question is here to be honest. And I’m sorry this ended up so long. I just guess I needed to type that out. Is this normal? Is it just postpartum? Or could this be leading down the road of PPD/ PPA? Thanks for reading �",
"First and foremost, I wish everyone here the best with everything that they have going on, as this is a very hard battle to handle and you all have my respect and empathy. Both the one having the PPD, as well as the partners being there to support them through this tough time. 

So this is more of a vent that I need to get out, but good faith advice would be welcomed. It is kinda long, Sorry! 

I (34M) and wife (37F) had our first/only LO about 4 weeks ago. My wife developed PPD/PPA and it has been the hardest thing I have had to manage in my life for a very long time.

I am at a loss dealing with my own guilty feelings for decisions I have made as well as trying to stay that strong and be supportive partner and show that I have my shit together when inside I am very much ""faking it till I make it."" 

My wife had an unexpected C-section as our lovely daughter decided she wanted to come 2 weeks early. Thankfully she was born healthy and beautiful! The reason for the semi emergency c-section was that my wife started to have preclampsia. This was an obsticale in its self. 

That day she told me she was going to go home because her BP was high, I told her to meet me at the ER as it was high enough to warrant an ER visit. She would not listen to me though and insisted on going to her OBGYN instead, I tried to tell her to just to to the ER but no luck, obvi the OBGYN was like why are you here and go to the ER. So long story short the Inducing and c-section was not planned (and have come to find out it is a risk factor for developing PPD, along with a few other risk factors I have now found in my own research.) 

So the PPD/A.. 
The days before the birth my wife had a few red flags that in retrospect I should have seen. She mentioned things like she ""wished she never got pregnant"", and that ""our lives would be much better if she didn't get pregnant"", etc. I brushed these off as normal things to be scared of because I mean you know... First Time Parents lol. 

After the birth while in the hospital she was trying to not have the baby come to the room as much as possible. I could understand this to get our rest as the first two days we were both exhausted, as this was all unexpected. She did not have anything packed for the hospital stay, I on the other hand had everything packed ready to go for me and the baby thankfully. On the third day in the hospital I told her we should have the baby overnight so we can get used to feeding the baby at night and if we have any questions we are in the hospital and can ask them. She was very hesitant about this, but I insisted for my own comfort too as I too am a first time parent. This should have been another sign to me though as everything was going okay otherwise, but she just did not want to spend time with the baby.


After getting home, everything was fairly smooth sailing for the first couple days, she seemed depressed and down but I just took that as the ""Baby Blues"" and the extreme fluctuations in hormones. After about 2 weeks though things began to progressively get worse. I noticed at night she would become extremely anxious and flustered and just looking around the room like she didn't know what was going on. At her 2 week OBGYN visit the Dr. Said that she only had the ""Baby Blues"" and it was okay and normal. A few days after this I told her to have the OBGYN call me. (I didn't have her personal number) I spoke with the OBGYN and let her know that things were not getting better and that they were in fact getting worse. The OBGYN then prescribed her some Lexapro. She started taking it for two days before the below event. The OBGYN also suggested a few psychiatrists and a hospital to go to in case of an emergency. 

This all culminated to an event Saturday night at midnight. She was trying to breastfeed the and she was looking extremely flustered and anxious. I noticed that she was making a fist with her hand (although I am sure she was not going to hit the baby) but she made a fist still in her anxiousness. I gently took the baby from her and said that I would feed her. (At this point we were doing both breast feeding as well as bottle feeding with the breast milk so she would have time to rest and not focus on trying to feed every 2 hours.) After I took the baby from her to feed her she broke down and started yelling at me ""the baby's going to die, the baby's going to die, the baby's not going to be able to eat, the baby's going to die."" 

At this point I called her family because I did not know who else to call at midnight to help in this  situation. There is a language barrier between myself and her parents, specifically her mother, as they speak Spanish and I'm only learning right now and I do not know enough to explain this situation effectively. (It is something that I am working on though.) So her aunt and her parents came to the house and spoke with her as I fed and took care of the baby. Her family and I decided during this time that it would be best for her to stay the night with her parents away from the baby crying etc, and I would stay with the baby to take care of her for the night alone and she could get rest. We would re-evaluate the next day. 

On Sunday we decided that it was best to take her to the psychiatric hospital to be evaluated to see if there is any thing that can be done to help her. Well... they decided to keep her for the week. (FML) This devastated me, as I felt that I let her down by taking her there and having her be admitted there for a whole week. I spent nights crying that week while she was in the hospital hoping and wondering if I did the right thing. She has said multiple times that they did nothing for her. She felt that it was ""a summer camp that she was not able to leave from"". I struggle with this still and question if I did the right thing by taking her there. She did show signs of self harm (not necessarily suicidal), however there were signs.

During the time she was in the hospital I took care of the baby at night/rest of weekend. Thankfully her parents were able to help during the day during working hours so I could work from home and be able to provide for us, as I no longer had any sick time or vacation time left to use, as it was used all for the birth of my daughter. 

After my wife was released a week later I felt happy that she was home however, I feel that things are still not good and that I am drowning in my own feelings of trying to be supportive for her as well as trying to be the main caregiver of my daughter, as my wife is not able to help effectively. She has helped a few times in feeding/changing, however she is very much not wanting to be around the baby nor wanting to hold the baby or anything like that at this time. I do all the cooking (always have) and I try and take on all the house work I can, but only so much time in the day lol. 

It has become extremely difficult as I feel like I am taking care of not only my newborn daughter alone, but also trying to take care of another person that is not able take care of themselves and is adding extra stress and mental loads. 

Today was my first day back at work in the office. (boss doesn't like WFH smh) My wife is at her parents house with the baby as she is not allowed to be alone with her. I asked my wife if she could send me a picture of her and the baby, so I can see them and that way she can feel that I am being part of her day still even from a distance. She sent me a picture of her, and then a separate picture of the baby in the bassinet. The baby was laying on a folded up sheet with a blanket over the top of her chest and legs, and the pacifier handing from the leash above her. I immediately wrote back saying that it's NOT okay and that the baby needs to be in the bassinet with just themselves and no loose blankets, nothing underneath her, etc. for safe sleeping practices and reducing the risk of SIDS. This is something that her mother did, and has done a few times. I have tried to iterate that this is not okay to do and things have changed in the last 40 years. This is where the language barrier hinders as well as she is not my mother but my MIL. I told my wife I need to be able to trust her when she is at her parents to make sure they are doing things safely. Thankfully she sent me a video afterwards showing the baby in the bassinet safely sleeping. 

I am struggling to try and be that supportive person/rock, as well as working, and trying to trust that her family going to do the correct practices to make sure that my daughter will be safe. I know they're not doing it out of ill will, but just out of being uninformed. 

This is all really straining me mentally
as I need to be hyper vigilant that she is not left alone with the baby, judge her mood and her anxiety levels so as to know if she is okay to be around the baby, making sure my daughter makes it to her pediatrician appointments, working to pay bills, and making sure she's fed/changed when not at her parents during the day. I have no problem taking care of my daughter, I enjoy it in fact (which I never thought would have been something that suited me well.) I have thought many times that this would be easier if it was just me doing this alone. 

Thankfully I go to therapy for myself, (which I started before the birth of my daughter for separate reasons)

Each day I do feel I see a glimmer of hope, but I don't know if that's just me being optimistic as every day is still very much a challenge. Hopefully the medication begins to work and in time things improve.

This is just something that I need to come to terms with and to try and be the best partner/father that I can be. 

Wow! Sorry for the long post lol! Reading back after writing this all out and it is a novel haha. I appreciate it if you read the whole thing LOL.

"I'm a FTM, and I think I might be struggling with PPD or PPA. I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is just part of being a new mom or something more serious.


Lately, I find myself repeating in my head, “This is my son; I am his mom,” but sometimes it feels like I’m taking care of someone else’s baby. That thought breaks my heart. I go through phases where I either feel overwhelmed, constantly researching and trying to perfect my parenting, or I feel completely numb. When I feel nothing, it’s like I’m living in a dull haze, and I worry that I’m cheating my son out of a joyful experience.


He’s almost 6 months old, and I’m just out of energy. I thought I was just tired, which I am, but it feels like it’s deeper than that. I try to engage with him and support his development, but I find myself becoming apathetic. Some days, I’d rather just put him in front of the TV and stare at the wall.


I’m embarrassed to admit that I’ve lied on the pediatrician’s questionnaires about PPD. I always rushed through them to avoid raising any flags, but now I don’t know how to approach my doctor. All I want is to be a better mom for my baby.


If anyone has been through something similar, I would appreciate any advice or guidance on how to navigate these feelings. How do I know if I need medication or additional support? Thank you for reading.",
"Hi all,
I have a 6 weeks old baby.
For the first 5 weeks I was so happy and so attached to my baby, I was so proud of myself of how well I was doing it. Since the last few days, I’ve been feeling very anxious and the intrusive thoughts have come back again. I am constantly having the intrusive thoughts of harming my baby, doubting myself if I really love him, etc and it is torturing me, even to a point that I even feel dizzy of the high level of anxiety I am feeling.
I’ve been suffering from anxiety and pure OCD from the past and I go to therapy , but since I had the baby I was feeling much better. It was like everything was gone. I feel like all the strategies that my therapist have told me I can’t even put them in place anymore. I feel so overwhelmed.
I went to the doctor yesterday and he upped my dose of antidepressants so hopefully that helps because I feel so lost. 
I am hating the feeling of detachment I’m having towards him since the last few days. I am not sure if it is due the lack of sleep and the chronic fatigue as he is not sleeping much. 
I really would like to hear other stories to see if I am not alone in this position and gets better. 
I feel numbed, tired, sad, super anxious… I was always so caring and loveable person and I don’t understand what is happening to me. My baby is much wanted and he is all we were dreaming about.
I feel I’m helpless.
Thank you in advance for your help and advice � ",
"I (28f) am 7 m pp. I struggle with PPD/PPA. I’m medicated (thank god bc man that was a rough ride) but recently I’m struggling with still feeling like me especially with my postpartum body :/
I gained 40lbs with my pregnancy, only to lose about 10 but kept the wait on as I breastfed. I hate it. I work out 3x week. I don’t eat terrible besides the occasional indulge, or treats. I don’t drink. I walk at least 2 miles a day just for fun with my baby. And I literally can’t lose. a. Pound. I hate myself postpartum. I feel like I have a chubby face that I’ve never had. I tell my husband constantly that I just hate how overweight I am. He tells me I’m beautiful that he thinks I look great. Ugh how do I overcome this, or lose baby weight while breastfeeding? :(",
"Does the constant fear and irrational thinking that something bad is going to happen to you and your kids will be left without a mom, ever end? Ever? I am exhausted. Just tired. All day, every day. On loop. ",
"I didnt expect postpartum to hit me so hard. I came into it uneducated and thought to myself how its not going to happen? OH, it did. & I started to notice it right before I had the baby. I'm 5 weeks postpartum and postpartum has hurt the foundation of my relationship & Stripped me down from who I was. The first week was the worst. I slept maybe two hours this week.. I was amazed by my baby and didn't want to keep my eyes off of him. The not sleeping thing was short-lived and I'm glad it almost ended in the first week. I felt distant from my partner as soon as I had the baby. Its like a huge barrier came between us because all my time and attention was on labor, the baby and my health. about two weeks I couldn't stand, bend over, barely even walk or go to the bathroom. I can say though, he is the greatest helper and caretaker and never left my side the whole time I really needed him , but he deserved some lovens too and to be extra appreciated in these moments and I fell short of that when he needed it the most.  A lot of people have tried talking to me about postpartum depression, all forms of postpartum. I deff felt the blues before but nothing like postpartum.",
"As a doula I believe there’s many topics that aren’t talked enough about during postpartum, I want moms and dads to express themselves and tell us stories, feelings and regrets during the first year of postpartum. Please also moms share your story of what someone did to you during postpartum that you’ll never forget. We want real and raw stories to hopefully we can help a mom not feel alone during this journey & if applicable a dad as well. ",
"My wife had our baby 8 days ago. She came home on day 5. 

She forbade me to be in the birthing room because I don't speak the local language well enough to communicate with the doctors or be a medical proxy. I reluctantly agreed. Her mom went instead. After she came home,  she accused me of abandoning her at the hospital. I asked her if she heard herself or remembered the long arguments where I said I wanted to be there and I was scared to leave her alone. She said even if I spoke the local language, I would have abandoned her because that's the kind of person I am. 

Now, she is chasing me for every little error I make. Microwave door open? She points at it and asks me if I'm 5 and why she has to remind me. 

We both get up at night to feed/burp the baby, but I am so anxious about our marriage that I can't fall back to sleep afterward. So I get about 1-2 hours of sleep a night while she gets 3-4. I do all the house chores when i get home and cook breakfast and dinner, but if I do them not exactly how she would, she reminds me and chastised me for being lazy. 

MIL comes in the day time to help with baby. Recently MIL is doing the same thing wife is. Chastising me for this and thay, getting involved in disagreements my wife and I have had in the past. When I stand up to MIL and gently but sarcastically tell her off (b/c I'm not married to her and don't have to take anything from her) wife blames me for being rude. 

I'm literally assaulted from all sides and my wife refuses to see any wrong in her mother and all the wrong in me. She gaslights me and demands that I apologize. Blames me that she doesn't have enough milk for the baby. 

In a rare lucid moment, she admitted that she would be offended if my mother did to her what her mother does to me. My parents are far away though and can't help. But she still says I should apologize and accept her mother's rudeness.

I cannot sustain this. I might be able to if I could sleep. But I can't. I gently suggested investigating PPA/PPD to my wife earlier and she says I'm gaslighted her. Don't tell me it will be over in 6 months to a year. I will either have suffered a psychotic break or have left by that time. Help. 

Edit to say that I have already bared my heart to her, ugly cried and pleaded with her just to try to be nice. She always says she can't be nice if I am too lazy to close the bathroom door fully etc. Even when I do all the little things she expects perfectly, I catch ugly looks and she doesn't really speak to me.

"Hi, 

I am 4 weeks post partum and have a beautiful baby boy at home. 
I’ve had a difficult pregnancy and been struggling with anxiety/depression since my teen years. I’m currently on antidepressants and had a really rough first two weeks after birth physically and mentally. My emotions were all over the place and I felt like a part of me died. I couldn’t enjoy my baby or even find energy to shower. 
I also was trying to breastfeed/ pump but nothing really was coming the first few days. I was told it’s normal but it felt anything but normal. I felt like a failure and gave up. I also was top tired to pump every 3 hrs and also give the bottle. 
I’ve since been struggling with a feeling of regret. I’ve tried to get my breastfeeding going again but it was too much for me. 
Any tips on how to let go of this feeling? ",
"My daughter is nearly 6months old. I've been diagnosed with post partum depression a few weeks after delivery but I was already seen by a therapist and a psychiatrist for a personality disorder that was under control so we were able to detect it really early on. I was EP so it was not possible to give me any medication but with therapy I was getting better... Then I started working again. I'm the sole provider of the household and I was still EP when I went back to work nearly 2 months ago. I decided to stop a few weeks ago because it was too much and I felt I was getting worse again and I needed to be put under medication.

The thing is stopping EP took a few weeks and my state deteriorated really quickly.. I had an appointment with the therapist last week and he talked about hospitalisation... I know I cannot keep going like that, because I'm really close to doing something bad I know that but I feel so guilty for not being able to do it all. I'm scaring my husband but also he's not feeling well himself so he's struggling to help me, and so I feel even more guilty. I just don't have any energy anymore, I'm constantly on edge, anxious like crazy and sometime I just can't anymore and I really really want to hurt myself. No one knows this but I've wrote a goodbye letter and counted the pills that I have to see if they were enough.. I haven't decided anything yet but I know when I do it'll be ready. I'm really scarring myself.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next Thursday, I could've tried to have one earlier but it's just too hard to do anything these days, I'm struggling to just live and take care of my daughter so calling to change my appointment was too much for me to deal with. I don't know what I'm going to tell her.. I know I need to be honest but im scared of what she's going to say. My husband said I cannot stay home like this, that at some point he's going to call the hospital himself but I'm scared my daughter won't recognize me anymore if I go there.

I just feel really really alone because no one understand what I'm going through..",
"I am 14m pp, and have flair ups every month. I’m quite teary most days and since giving birth have become incredibly angry and resentful and irritable. I take this out on my husband who is by all accounts, supportive, loving and my number 1 fan. Every mini argument or ‘don’t leave the cup in the sink’ small type of comment becomes a massive deal in my head where it’s just a comment to my husband and part of normal marriage and life. Generally life is pretty good otherwise, baby is great and husband is my best friend and, sure we could do with more money and a holiday and sleep but we have no big big stresses in our life. But my anger is horrific. I honestly in the moment am so furious and then afterwards I can’t think why I was so mad and it seems pathetic and self centred. I am aware it’s probably not something to get angry about and unfair to lash out so I rarely say anything but that’s not working and I’ve become a shit person to be around. It’s reached a point where I’ve pushed him too far and I am looking for therapy. Please share with me your success getting out of ppd and relationships improving with therapy. I have been diagnosed with ppd by my doctor and Zoloft but haven’t taken it because apprehensive about taking medication long term. Please share your tips and healthy ways of dealing with your anger. Please. I am actively ruining myself and my life and my marriage and I hate it.",
"I’m almost 7 weeks postpartum (had a bit of a traumatic birth + an episiotomy). I’m not ready to have sex yet, the thought of it really scares me and I just have no sex drive whatsoever. I have pleasured him twice (orally) since I had baby but felt like I was doing it for his sake. Every time any intimacy gets mentioned I refuse and I can tell he’s not happy and gets quite moody about it. We have argued quite a lot about it too as I found him looking at other women on his phone and when I mention that he says things like “what do you expect me to do” I don’t know if I’m being stupid by getting upset at the fact he’s looking at other women but I’m also not fulfilling his needs so do I just have to be ok with it? I hate my body and the way that I feel and it just makes me feel worse. He also makes me feel like it’s not normal to feel like this and I don’t know how to help him understand. Like is he meaning to make me feel like this? Does he not have respect for me anymore? ( I had asked if he could just not look at other women whilst I feel how I do about myself, even too look at pictures of me instead) I really want to be happy especially for my new baby but I feel like I just think about this a lot and it really does get me down. Im having to worry and stress about this as well as everything that comes with taking care of a newborn. Im also breastfeeding and doing every night shift on my own as he works throughout the day so I’m always tired and that’s another thing that gets to me. He mentions me starting work again a lot (which I’m also not ready for) and when I say about me doing every night shift he says it’s because he has to get up for work but I feel like I have to do the same thing (having a baby is a job to me) and maybe if he did the night shift a few times a week I’d be less tired and have more energy to think about having sex. Has anyone had any similar issues? Does he need to go? Is it worth fixing. Someone please help with these thoughts in my head. ",
"I don’t know where to start. My son is a year old, I’ve been diagnosed with post partum depression (when he was three weeks old) as well as birth trauma and PTSD. Things have improved but they got harder this weekend around his birthday. I still feel overwhelmed, depleted and claustrophobic. I feel like I run from work to take care of him, fill in the gaps of my husbands ADHD and it gets to be too much. I don’t know what to do. I feel ashamed because just one kid takes everything from me but all around me people have three or more kids and are fine (it seems)",
"I’ve found that cold plunges and fasting are the only practices that can give me temporary relief from the despair. Sometimes sauna but not reliably.  Alcohol and caffeine too, but they make me feel down later.

"I feel unworthy of her, she has been through so much in just the first 5 weeks of life. Traumatic birth and she had to be in intensive care for weeks and we also experienced awful medical negligence. I couldn’t protect her and now we’re finally home whenever she cries I feel my whole body tenses up and I want to be sick. My house is an absolute mess and I can’t bring myself to clean or do anything else but take care of her. I have lost myself in all of this and my anxiety is killing me. I’m confused to why I had a baby in the first place because my mental health has always been bad so I decided a long time ago not to have children because of that, but I still ended up having a baby. I’m scared of myself, I’m scared I will make a mistake, or hurt her by mistake or even hurt myself. I can’t focus and I’m forgetting everything due to the PTSD. I can’t go on like this I don’t know what to do ",
"TW: suicidal thoughts 

I thought by the end of my 12 week maternity leave this would get better but it seems to just have gotten worse and worse. I really don’t even want to live anymore. I don’t see a future where I can continue being a mom. This feels like a nightmare

I used to look forward to the end of the work day because I don’t totally love my job, but now I’m going to dread going home and seeing my baby. I feel trapped and like I can’t be happy anywhere. I feel so selfish and like I’m putting myself first. But in total honesty, I wish I never had my daughter. I look at her and feel so much regret it hurts. 

I need this to get better and I don’t know when it will. I spend so much time away from the baby and my husband just pretending like she doesn’t exist. I don’t want to live anymore. But nobody takes my thoughts seriously. I’m out of FMLA, PTO and sick time. I wish I could take additional time off to get some kind of mental health help. I hate all of this. ",
"I'm 3 months I'm not sad but I've been randomly crying,I'm so worried something is going to happen and I just can't sleep no matter how hard I try, I'm awake until I pass out and I'm fortunate enough to have help. I've had no problems taking care of my baby but I struggle to do self care because I'm so worried something is going to happen. I get so worried when someone other then my baby's father holds them.

those who like got have an update: here is, there is much

I hate motherhood with all of my guts, I hate it

I want to do whatever I want

I want to not worry about anyone, not calling children services on me, it drives me crazy

and to be honest, I don't know is if its fair to me

plus it's easy to put up my baby for adoption I don't have any emotional connection with her so t will be easy

I haven't done it yet

to be fair, I'm not doing too well myself like I'm struggling

my mental health is so bad

mentally and emotionally

financially, I just got a job

I don't know if I can handle this, I do feel down and low of myself, I know im not stable \\

I dont want to get any help for postpartum depression, I changed my mind, im never going to get any better.

i dont want to get help, I know that people dont care about me so im giving up

I have severe postpartum depression

  
feel free to share your thoughts on my posts, just don't be mean to me, I'm going through a really rough time ",
"This is a situation that I’ve been having a hard time trying to figure out how to approach and deal with.. My husband hasn’t been helping with the baby as much as I thought he would. It’s been 7 weeks so far and I feel like he still hasn’t gotten a grasp of taking care of the baby or even really helping me with him. He seems to just do his own thing and he does tell me “if you need anything, let me know”, but I find myself not even bothering most of the time because I feel like I end up having to step in anyway. I have talked to him about it before and mentioned to him how I’m having a hard time, my postpartum depression has been effecting me a lot, and how I need him to help out more rather than just do his own thing at first. Prior to this, he did mention to me he had some depression which worried me. He does become rather avoidant of some responsibilities when he gets depressed. Which I’m not saying as an excuse, because I clearly am depressed too and have been having to deal with the majority of the baby care. He started to put in some effort, but I feel like he went back to not helping as much again. 
We do live with my parents for now because it’s easier for us financially and my husband is deploying overseas in January. Although I do highly appreciate the help from my parents, I feel like they have been helping more with the baby than my own husband and I can feel my dad’s judgement from across the room every single day about my husband’s lack of effort. It honestly stresses me out a lot. 
I’ve had two incidents recently that are starting to get me to my breaking point.. Yesterday I made a comment about going back to work possibly soon and he seemed upset about it. His paternity leave is much longer than my maternity leave (and even paid) so he essentially said he doesn’t want to take care of the baby alone which is why he doesn’t want me to go back to work yet. I found this extremely frustrating because I myself take care of the baby alone all the time. Not to mention I was only going back maybe 1-2 shifts a week for 4 hours (it’s a part time job) to ease into it. I also really love my job for once and have been missing it. It’s one thing I’ve been missing about myself prior to having a baby since I feel like I’ve been losing so much about me. 
Then today my baby has been extra fussy and a little harder to sooth him. When my baby is with my husband, he can’t seem to soothe him at all and my baby even seems to get louder. My dad tells me “you know why he does that with him? It’s cause he isn’t used to him” before he went to bed… 
Now I’m here stuck wondering what to do. I know my husband doesn’t mean to be like this. I know it’s not malicious or anything like that “you’re the wife/mom so it’s your job”. I really feel like he gets very overwhelmed trying to take care of the baby and doesn’t know how to go about it even when I’ve tried to help. I don’t want to nag him or get on him like he’s a child, but I also don’t want him just getting away with all of this. He’s leaving to go overseas soon and I really don’t want him missing out on the first few months of our son’s life because he’s not even going to be able to see him again til he turns 1.
I really hope this gets better and I can figure out a way to communicate that I need more involvement from him without it causing an argument or any issues.",
"I’m 26. I have a 3 year old, 2 year old, and 5 month old. I have a great husband who tries his best to help me, but he works more than full time and I’m a SAHM. I’m tired. I’m so tired. Anytime I tell people that they say “well yeah, you’ve got three babies”. Thanks, not helpful. But..it’s like my soul is tired. I get plenty of sleep for the most part. But down to my bones I’m just..tired. Burnt out I guess. Tired of feeling unheard. My toddlers don’t listen to a word I say. “They’re toddlers”. Yeah, I know, thank you, but they LITERALLY don’t listen to a word I say. Something has got to change. They listen to their dad. He comes home and all I want to do is be listened to. Tell a story where he’s engaged, making eye contact, not changing the subject or saying “haha look at the baby” when I’m mid sentence. My kids don’t listen, he doesn’t listen. I stop talking mid sentence sometimes to see if anyone notices and they never do. I do so much for them, and I know if I died tomorrow, I’d be missed, but right now, it feels like everyone would just miss having clean clothes and food. My husband has to work a lot. Because We have three babies. And I can’t complain, because we’ve been blessed with three healthy babies that I’m able to stay home with. I can’t complain. Everyone tells me “you’re so blessed”. I know I’m blessed. I feel blessed. But I feel empty a lot of the time too. I cry so much more than I used to. I love my kids so so so much. But I feel like I’m just a vessel holding love for them. I’m nothing else. The old me is gone and I can’t find her anywhere. I have hobbies but little time to do them. I know this is just a season of life. My rational brain knows that. “These are the good old days”, “don’t wish their lives away”, “some day you’ll miss the fingerprints on everything”. I know. And part of the reason I cry all the time is the guilt I feel about that. I love them. But I’m so tired. But to wake up every day to the same stuff “no don’t touch that”, “don’t hit your brother”, “please don’t wake the baby”.. I’m so tired. I’ve never tried therapy but I feel like I need to. Something just doesn’t feel right. I’ve lost myself sometime in these past 3 years and every now and then I’ll get a glimpse my old self, but I can never get ahold of her for any significant period of time. I can’t afford therapy and insurance likely won’t cover it. Waiting to see if it’s approved so fingers crossed. I don’t want medication. I just need someone to listen to me. Even if they have to be paid to do it. I need confirmation that I’m not just a ghost, I do really exist and people can hear me. I’m also anxious, overstimulated, my needs are rarely met, and then, after a long hard day, I’m laying in bed and I get the tap on my shoulder from my husband. But my sex drive is absolutely gone has been since baby #1. “That’s normal, you have 3 babies”.  I would love to feel normal again. But I don’t remember what normal feels like. 
And I would never hurt myself or my kids. Never. They’re my whole heart. But I’m at my lowest right now. I don’t know what the purpose of this post is, I guess I just need to vent, or for someone to hear me. ",
"Hi everyone, posting here because I'm learning the hard way that men can get postpartum depression. And, as someone who's also been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder (formerly diagnosed with Chronic Depression) this has been extra challenging.

I'm thankful to have an amazing wife who's been extremely supportive throughout this, but I don't have any friends I can talk to about this, and I've been struggling a lot. I've been on meds that work really well for the past 3 years, and this past week it's like they just stopped working. And even though I'm no stranger to depression, I forgot how fucking debilitating it can be.

Fortunately, this hasn't resulted in any negative feelings towards our beautiful baby boy or towards my incredibly kind and supportive wife, but I'm barely getting through the day. Also, as a man with mental illness, I've suppressed my desire to cry so many times from a young age that I can't cry when I know I need to (this has been a problem for years). I've even started to get up earlier than normal to do yoga and meditation and clean, but it just feels like it's barely holding back the storm instead of actually making things better.

I just want to be the best husband, father, and me I can be, but I'm struggling.

So, any dads here with PPD? Or anybody here who has pre-existing mental illness? 

Thanks everyone, and stay strong.",
"FTM, almost 9 weeks PP.
Apologies ahead of time, a lot of this is ramblings I just need to get off my chest.


My son was very wanted. I struggled for two years TTC, ended up having to do IVF and had our miracle baby. Since having him, I have good days where I just have all the good energy to play with him, but there’s other days where I just stare at him and think I’m not good enough to be a mom. I keep thinking he should have a better mom - someone who can care for him in ways I struggle to. I feel like he deserves so much better. I was holding him yesterday and I just burst out crying because I felt like I don’t deserve him. I had to immediately give him to my husband and walk away for a bit.

My relationship with my husband is rocky, but it got worse since a few days ago because I didn’t think about something and my husband has had enough. Words exchanged can’t be unheard. He’s usually very loving to me, but last few days he barely speaks to me, which makes me feel very alone and broken as a person. He’s always been incredibly supportive and patient throughout our relationship. He says he still loves me, but something is different now and it’s severely impacting my mental health. Our relationship is literally hanging on by a thread but divorce is out of the question. And he isn’t the type of person who would ever want to do couple’s counseling. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, afraid of what I’m going to do to mess things up again.

Most of yesterday I just kept thinking I don’t want to be here. The thought of growing older and actually being responsible in raising a child gives me way too much anxiety. I feel like I can’t do it. I had a good upbringing but I feel like I can’t do the same for my son because our house right now just feels broken. I have trouble planning ahead because I mostly just think about myself and what serves my needs. I’ve been like this most of my life that it’s been such a struggle for me to break free from it. I’m used to others planning stuff for me, but when I have to do it I get immense anxiety because I keep overthinking that it’s not good.

I just don’t want to be here but I’m too much of a coward to do anything about it. I don’t want to live but I keep thinking about everyone I love and them wondering why I made such a selfish decision. I can’t talk to anyone about this because I know what everyone will say… but I’m really struggling right now. I didn’t know who else to turn to, so I’m posting here.

I’m really struggling mentally. I just feel sorry for my son and husband that they have to deal with me. I’m just sorry all the time. I’m just… really struggling to get through the day.

Thanks for letting me ramble. Pretty sure I’ll delete this post at some point, but I just needed to get it off my chest.",
I am a week postpartum and am having a really hard time with visitors. Even my parents or in laws wanting to visit makes me anxious and sends me into a breakdown. Seeing others hold my baby or feed her triggers something that breaks me down. I don’t know if this is a normal feeling to have postpartum.. I hope it gets better. It’s a shitty feeling to not even want your parents to visit.,
"TW: PPD, PPA, Body dysmorphia 


‘Good Morning, Momma’ 

Oh, good morning Postpartum Anxiety. Every morning, I rush to find him and make sure he’s still inhaling and exhaling. Every morning, he’s always found safe with Daddy, he gave me time for sleeping again. 

Oh, good morning Momma Guilt. Yes, I slept through most of the night. Yes, I let dad take care of him through the night. Yes… maybe you’re right.. maybe I am a bad mother for last night… 

Oh, good morning Postpartum Body Dysmorphia. I really need to change out of this nighty.. I’ve been wearing it for two days straight now, and it’s covered in spit up and baby urine… But nothing fits anymore, not like it should. This is a new body, stretched and worn, maybe I won’t ever like the way I look ever again… 

Oh, good morning Postpartum Depression. I slipped and dropped my pumped milk this morning… and my world came crashing down. How could I be so careless, surely I must punish myself for this… Will the tears ever stop? Will the pain in my chest ever calm down? 

Oh, good morning my precious baby son. When you look up at me with those beautiful blue eyes, all my worries wash away. Your little toothless smile brightens up my world more than you could ever know. When I feel your heart beating on my chest, and feel your precious little breaths on my cheek, I know we’re both gonna get through this stage of life just fine, as long as we always have each other. 

Oh, good morning Momma. You still have tear streaks stained on your cheeks while you make that bottle for your son, but you’re gonna make it. You’re a powerful woman, and a wonderful momma. Don’t let the anxiety, or depression, or body dysmorphia, or guilt ever make you believe otherwise. You will rock today, and tomorrow, and everyday after.

"We had our first baby 4 months ago. I am struggling really badly with PPD and ppa. I was doing better but had a recent set back with medication changes. He's given up so much already because of my mental health but he's supposed to be in an all day golf tournament tomorrow leaving me with babe to go to a family gathering alone. I've brought it up and he keeps saying he will miss it for me but maybe I'll feel better by Saturday. It's now Friday, he is coming home early from work to support me because I'm still struggling but still wants to golf tomorrow. I don't know how to tell him I need him to miss it. I know he will be upset and I hate that I can't even do the simple task of going to a family gathering alone but I've had the worst anxiety over it since he told me about it. He also tends to get quite drunk at these tournaments and I'll be home alone after the gathering till he gets home smashed. 
What do I do? Just be honest and say he can't go? Suck it up and let him ? I wish I wasn't like this and I could just be ok but I'm not right now ",
"So I am currently 10 months postpartum.
So a little recovery story 
After I had my son I was so depressed and I didn’t wanna take care of him, I was always mad at him, and I really just felt like I was baby sitting someone else’s baby.

Back story I had a traumatic emergency C-section and most people know how that goes. You lose 30 minutes of a golden hour it’s traumatic sometimes and just not a good time 

I spoke with my spouse about this and about how I felt our son hated me and I could tell and I feel like he wasn’t even mine 
My spouse was so loving and caring for my physical needs after the birth cooking, cleaning, helping me get dressed but he doesn’t really understand how to mentally be there for someone. He had a lot of love but not in the right way for my mentality.

Well I kind of forced myself on my son and always told him I loved him and would snuggle him but it didn’t get better till about 3 months ago. Honestly I’m just on a rant and I want other moms to know it gets better and I believe in you.

I love my son so much I know he loves me and I don’t feel like I’m baby sitting someone else’s kid anymore. It gets better. I promise.

Sorry for the rant. Thanks for reading.",
"I am completely burnt out. I am 11 weeks post partum. All i ever want to do is sleep. I am low on vitamin D. I don’t want to be a bad parent to my child, but i am so burnt out. He has all of his needs and i make sure he’s fed, changed and bathed! But i on the other hand am struggling. My boyfriends works, and when he’s home he really helps with the baby. But i still feel so alone and cluttered. I’m trying to get into therapy. I love my son to bits and am trying to be a good mom to him. I am just really stuck right now and don’t know what to do. ",
I am 5 months postpartum and wanted to know if anyone has these symptoms: Does anyone have like a cooling sensation all over their bodies? Or have you experienced pins and needles sensation with weird sensation feeling in your head? I have the cooling sensation all over my body but mainly behind my eyes and my head. I also have pins and needles in my face and today I've had a pinching feeling on my cheek then it jumped to the other cheek.,
"I'm dealing with postpartum depression and anxiety and although we had our baby 8 months ago, it's still very intense. I'm in therapy, medicated, but as you all know, that only goes so far and doesn't always ""cure"" some of these hormonal fluctuations.

We've had sex only 3 times since our baby was born. And actually, in nearly a year, because we didn't have sex for a few months leading up to the birth. I was unable to orgasm any of those times because he finished before I could and then I just felt gross so I got cleaned up and dressed. It makes me feel fat, ugly and hideous when I can't finish.

Sex is huge for me. I need that connection, that intimacy. I used to be in the adult entertainment industry, my husband knows this, he knows that I feel so uncomfortable with my body postpartum because of the changes. However, that doesn't mean I'm not sexual with him. I try to initiate a lot, I try to compliment him a lot, but he's always ""too stressed"" which is fine, I get it. He got a new position at work earlier this year and it's been incredibly stressful. Stress can make it difficult for him to perform. Because of this new job, he's missed a lot of our baby's first year, I've been alone with her and our other kid a lot.

I happened to be on his tablet to show him something. When I opened his browser, I opened a new tab and saw that he'd recently been viewing a lot of porn. It really upset me. I know he's allowed to watch that, he can do whatever he wants. But ffs, I'm here, begging to be fucked, and he's off watching porn instead of coming to me? I don't care if he uses it to get going, as long as it finishes with me. He knows, with my history in the adult entertainment field, I get very uncomfortable with porn because it's one of those ""what I was"" and ""what I am now"" things.

So now I feel like I'm unreasonably upset about this. Because I know he has needs but so do I. And I feel like he was ignoring my needs and wants and went straight to porn vs asking me to suck him off or whatever. It sounds so silly, because of all people, everyone says I should be fine with it. That I could watch porn too. Yes, I could, but there's nothing out there I enjoy - I really find my husband to be the epitome of sexual attractiveness and he's not out there filming porn. 

I'm so mad and upset with him. And because of my PPD/a, my thoughts run wild and they run to ""divorce him, you're not worthy of him"" and I hate that. He knows I'm struggling and that my brain is going to these places. That I feel horrible, ugly. I still suffer from DMER with breastfeeding occasionally and going from sexy to a cow hurts a lot. ",
I’m 8 months postpartum and my ppd/ppr are at an all time high. We had to move to a different city and it’s been hard on me I feel so alone and my husband doesn’t understand he thinks it’s just me being dramatic or problematic but I can’t control it I’m so overwhelmed and feel like everything is piling up I feel like somebody is pushing on my chest 24/7 and I can’t sleep and I haven’t been eating much I can’t take a nap because somebody always needs something from me when I want to nap. I just want disappear. I’m really trying but I feel like I’m just getting worse.,
"Im 5 months postpartum and im still feeling a cooling sensation in my head. It used to be all over my body, not so much now. Now it's mainly behind my eyes and brain. Please has anyone had this happen to them. I'm desperate and not sure if this is normal or not. I just want to know if anyone has experienced this.",
"My birth experience was not smooth sailing and a bit chaotic so I feel like my mental decline started there. I had to get a c-section very last minute at my 38 week appointment because my blood pressure was not coming down and my baby was still breech. I barely had anything ready and set up at home too. After I had my baby things still continued to feel chaotic. I had what I was told was acid reflux throughout my pregnancy but it turned out to be gallbladder attacks. I went to the ER for one after my birth and was told it was actually my gallbladder. I had to stay at a hospital out of town for 4 days. I only stayed for so long because the gastroenterologist I was given drug everything out.. I didn’t even have the problem solved while there and he made me make an outpatient appointment after my stay to get things done.. Then a hurricane came through my area and thankfully we weren’t affected but my city was pretty shut down and it slowed down my progress on getting things done. Then I had to go back to the ER because my c-section incision had a small opening on one end (thankfully it’s healed now). That same night I had the worst gallbladder attack that also gave me a horrible panic attack. The pain lasted for 3 days and I went back to the ER on the third day. My levels elevated due to my gastroenterologist procrastinating my procedure. I got sent back to the hospital out of town to stay the night and then have my procedure. For 3-4 days after my procedure I was in a lot of pain and had so much soreness. They also didn’t take out my gallbladder and only put a stent in the duct so I’ve been paranoid that the pain will eventually come back. 
So overall, I mix of crazy issues with my health and being set back with a lot of things I’ve been trying to get done, I’ve felt so lost and alone. This is my first baby and it’s all so new. I feel like I’ve been struggling so much more than I’m supposed to. I end up feeling so trapped and lonely in my own house when I even still live with my parents with my husband. I end up spending the whole day in the living room taking care of my fussy baby and mindlessly watching tv to keep me from being in my head too long. I have a hard time doing things I enjoy because I lost interest or feel like I can’t do it without being stopped. Being in my own room overwhelms me cause it’s so small and gets messy so fast. Everything is so hard to keep up with. I just want to feel normal again…",
Hey! I am a young mom. I just had my baby two months ago. I’ve been experiencing some mood changes. I really don’t  want to get mad at things but sometimes I just randomly get angry at things or people. I don’t have many friends anymore since I got pregnant at a young age. My boyfriend and I are still doing great. I live next to my mother so I do have help when needed. I don’t understand what is going on? I wanna be better for my son and family. What can I do?,
"It’s been almost 9m pp and I’m still feeling bad. I hate myself, I’m sad or angry all the time. My husband is still working two jobs away from home so I have minimal help. I have older kids who go to school so constantly need pick up/drop off and extra curricular activities. I’m going to counseling and have changed meds 1 time. I’m spread so thin and don’t have time except in the morning when the big kids are at school.  I go to the gym now to try and lose the baby weight and at the end I always feel horrible about myself. The twins are with me and constantly talk to me and won’t leave me alone. 
FYI- there is a genetic screening you can do to see which drugs will interact best with your body. The original Prozac was on my red list. 

My hubs just doesn’t understand. No one does. I hate going to church bc I feel like a phony. I don’t have any friends and the one I did have ghosted me. 

I really just want to disappear. I have no skills to get a job or a degree. I’m a SAHM and I feel complete useless and just a waste of space and resources. 

I don’t feel like I’m ever going to get better. My husband deserves someone better and my kids deserve a better mom.

"How do you know if these thoughts are really ""you"" or just the postpartum talking? I have hit a wall and feel like I cannot do this. I just want to run. FTM to 4 month old twin girls. I feel as though I could drop my girls off to someone else and feel totally okay. What a horrible human I am to be able to say this? My husband and girls do not deserve this, they are all so great and deserve so much better. Who matters most in all of this? My girls, my husband, myself? I don't know. I want to be a good wife and a good mom and do not understand how I am supposed to ""suffer"" everyday for the rest of my life being a mom, this is not what I wanted but accidents happen and now I feel like I am living a life sentance for the worst crime committed and am supposed to try and find a way to be happy but how? How am I supposed to accept a life I did not plan to live? But I have to be strong for my girls because they matter more than myself, right? How do you know who matters most. I just feel so sad and lost. ",
"I'm a first time father. My partner has our beautiful baby girl born 4 months ago. 

I'm really struggling with the state my partner is currently in. She's very short and very distant with me. Has even talked about if we don't work out.

I'm trying my best offering help and support. Is it normal for women to treat there spouses in this manner during post partum state.

I change babies diapers and also bath her and ask I can do anybting more to support her, she also asked recently she wants space from me which is slowly chipping away at my sanity and giving anxiety and ultimately making me very sad. There are days some times I wonder if we're gonna make it to the other side or will I be a single father moving forward with life.

Really need some words of encouragement or some tips for others who have made it across to the other side and have become stronger during the rough times.

By the end of the day I'm beyond overstimulated to the point I get so angry and short tempered with my oldest. I hate yelling, but when baby is crying and he's talking to me it feels like someone is scrapping my brain with a pickaxe. How do you handle it? I have a weighted blanket to help regulate and am going to go find some fidget toys tomorrow but I need suggestions on how to help me calm myself down. ",
"Hi there!
I believe I’ve maybe overcome my ppd for the most part. My ppa is pretty severe and fluctuates. 
What I’m noticing is that my brain is just not really functioning well. I feel like I’m floating a lot of the time.
Sometimes it makes me nervous to be caring for a little babe. I’m certain that other mamas feel this.. brain fog and mama brain is talked about so much. I really am having a hard time functioning though at all. It feels stronger than just brain fog.
What has helped you the most?
Thank you! ",
"I have bad post partum anxiety, horrible. I fell when I was pregnant at 38 weeks and I have major issues thinking I’m going to fall or some else is going to fall with her in their hands. I also have separation anxiety.

Does anyone know how I could get additional weeks of disability? For. PPD? I live in Texas. ",
why is it that as soon as you have your child you cease to exist? even my own parents. i brushed it off at first because i appreciated the help and getting a small break but 10 months postpartum still not  acknowledging my existence and going straight to my child? not saying a word unless i call it out? definitely wanting to cut ties ,

I miss my mom so much, and I can’t shake the sadness, even though I want to stay positive for my baby. It's hard to balance the grief with the excitement and joy that pregnancy is supposed to bring.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you manage the emotional rollercoaster? I’d love any advice, or things to read that helped. Or if you have any coping strategies that helped you get through it?",
"My girlfriend and I had a child that was born preterm, 37 weeks to be exact. She had to spend 3 weeks with him in the nicu while I had to go back and forth to work. When we got home I noticed that she was showing signs of depression. Was crying alot, expressed hatred and self hatred. Bady was easier to calm down with me and the family instead of her. Even took a test the midwife gave her that showed she had a good chance of dealing with post partum depression and was given zolof. Well she deny being depressed. She wanted to stay awake for days on end and completely lost her appite at some point. Eventually we had a fight about pumping and I got real ugly. I'll admit it wasn't my best moment, but after the fact she admitted to has thoughts of not wanting to be here. I work a job that requires me to be gone 48 hours at a time so I had to leave work and get her to a friends of mine house. Eventually after that she admitted that she had a plan and had thoughts of hurting the baby. When I got off work I had to basically force her to go and get admitted in a psychward. She is going to be realsed soon and I am afraid for her to be alone with the baby, so I am thinking about selling my house and moving in with my brother who has family on the property that can help with the childcare.

My man went to basic training for the army and he's been having a terrible time. I've only talked to him twice and he's been wanting to come home. Even talked about a early separation because he can't adjust to military life.

My wife and I had our second child two years ago. After the baby came she had postpartum and was unable to watch our children. She has since acquired a gambling addiction and still has never watched our children by herself to this day. Now that our youngest is two years old I feel like maybe she is just using postpartum as an excuse to make me watch our girls all the time. I wake up with them early in the morning and watch them until they go to sleep except for when I’m at work and her mother watches them. (4 days a week) She is always off doing what she wants to do (gambling shopping and goes to work when she feels like it at the pawn shop I own) I feel alone because I am responsible for the finances and responsible for our children every second her mom is not watching them. I am about to leave but wanted to know if anyone here believes this could still be postpartum 2 years later or is it just an excuse to get me to watch our girls 24/7 while she’s off doing what she feels like doing? Thanks for your opinions ,
"Trigger warning*(talks of self harm)


I think I have developed PPD, my doctor told me it was likely to happen do to me suffering from depression as a teen. Back then I hated myself, how skinny I was and how weak I was. From that I'd punish myself by cutting and I also abused alcohol. As I gotten older I grew to love myself more and now only drink wine recreationally. Fast forward, I started dating my best friend, we got married, bought a house together, are both students and he's also military, and I just pushed out our baby boy this Monday. I thought I'd be fine as I’d been only having an issue with accepting my new body during pregnancy. I never to account that my issue with feeling like a burden to my husband(he takes care of me a lot and its sometimes hard for me to see the things I do for him) would come to hunt me. After having our son I felt so absolutely happy. Things started to take a dive since I'd been struggling with all the pain that comes with labor, not being able to do much as you risk hurting yourself further, and not being able to breastfeed if you're taking medications such as opioids. With this being my current reality I've developed feelings of hopelessness, nightmares/trouble sleeping, feeling useless and pathetic, and overall feeling like a failure as a person and as a new mother. I realized it was hitting the lines of PPD when I started to feel like my husband and son would be better without me, like I didn't deserve the great treatment or happiness, and like I wanted to give up completely( let go of life) whenever the extreme pain strikes. My mind for some reason can't understand that its the first few days after labor, so of course I shouldn't be doing too much, of course I’ll have to wait to breastfeed(I've been pumping and dumping to keep up supply for when I can use it), and of course I’ll feel useless or like a failure due to small mistakes or not being able to fully help out or see the things I do do. I fully understand all of this, though even then, my mind is still beating me down, I've been crying so much and saying and thinking horrible things about myself. I fear I’m falling into a hole again, most of me wants to stay there. My husband is so supportive but sometimes I hate that he helps me so much, I feel like he deserves someone who’s stronger, more independent, has full confidence in their selves. I love him and my son more than anything in the world, but I can't lose the feeling that I’m holding them back. I don't know, my head is a mind field of negativity right now…",
"I am 4 weeks pp and on the struggle bus. I have the absolute best husband who helps with any and everything. He does all night feeds and is probably more hands on than I am. He goes back to work Monday and I am terrified of being alone with my child. 

All I’ve wanted for so long is to be a mother, and now I feel like I regret having my child. I love her so much because she is mine, but I feel zero connection to her. I called my mom to take my her overnight tonight just so we could have a break and I feel so guilty about it. 

I don’t know if these are normal pp feelings that will pass or if I should try to get into my OB sooner. This is so much harder than I ever imagined it would be �",
"Going back to work is making my postpartum depression a lot worse. My job got changed right before I went on leave to one that has a lot more responsibilities than what I had before, and it’s stressing me out. 

My DH is usually very loving and kind, but he doesn’t understand anything about my parenting style and goals. Even before we got married I said I wanted to have kids and homeschool them. Eventually I compromised by saying I would go back to work when our child is able to be safe at daycare. I’m traumatized by stories of daycare workers abusing babies. It’s my biggest fear. I said I wanted to stay home for six more months on unpaid leave (my job has to offer me back a position), and he said no because he doesn’t want to pay 600 USD a month for insurance. Instead he wants his mom and other family members to watch the baby while I go to work. As an added bonus, his mom doesn’t like me and doesn’t feel strong enough to lift the baby. Why tf should I leave the baby with her? 

If I quit my job, he said he won’t buy me anything. I’m not expecting steak dinners, but it hurts to know he thinks it’s okay to say I can never go get a Starbucks or get my roots done every couple of months. He pretty much said he wouldn’t let me make a single financial decision in the household if I quit. Not even food. 

I could get it if he didn’t have the money, but he literally makes 3x more than I do. It makes me mad he won’t even ask his job what insurance would be if I quit my job. If I tell people I’m struggling I just get told “there’s no need for you to be depressed. Most people have it worse than you”. 

Now I also have my mom telling me I’m a bad mom because I’m “putting my job above my kids” and that she didn’t raise me to be that way. She knows that I didn’t choose going back so it just feels worse. I feel like I can’t win and I’ll need a lot of mental help when I go back to work because I don’t feel stable anymore.  

For those of you in a similar situation, what helped you stay sane after returning to work? ",
"Hi all, 
 I am really struggling. How do you come to terms with and learn to accept a life you never thought you would live? I never really wanted kids but got pregnant (yes I was taking precautions) and I could not bring myself to abort them or anything of that sort. But now I just really struggle having to think of living the rest of my life in a way I never wanted to. It’s such a huge daunting feeling and makes me want to just curl up in a ball and disappear. I keep flashing back to life before babies and knowing I could have had that forever but was robbed of it and it’s just heartbreaking. I don’t know how to accept this new life of mine and find some sort of joy because the days are becoming very very long and heavy living in this mindset. ",
"Trying to keep it brief; apologies if this doesn't make sense I'm really in a dark place.

I had a severe bout of depression start last week. I've never experienced anything like this before in my life. Psychiatrist thinks it was triggered by a perfect storm of sleep deprivation, weaning off night time breastfeeds and underlying trauma/undiagnosed ADHD/ASD. 

I've been bed bound up until yesterday. I was nearly sectioned because I couldn't think past not wanting to be alive anymore. I've had intensive home treatment with daily visits from psychiatrist and psych nurse. I've started multiple meds. The psychiatrist basically gave my partner an ultimatum: ""keep her here under your supervision or she will have to be admitted to the hospital"". It's a lot for him; he's suddenly found himself having to run the house and care for our 3.5yo and 11mo. Work have given him paid leave. We don't want me to go into hospital. We're in the UK and past the threshold for the local MBU because my baby turns 1 in 2 weeks time. The idea of a general psych ward fills me with dread and I don't see myself getting better there

Anyway, since I've been able to get out of bed my partner keeps taking out his frustrations on me. He wanted to have a shower and said ""you need to watch the kids so I can wash"". I had literally just woken up after minimal sleep and they were both upset (a huge trugger for me right now). They'd not had breakfast, got dressed or had their teeth brushed. They were both sat in front of the TV having not had a proper breakfast just eating dry cereal from a bowl. I instantly went into a meltdown; crying and panicking to the point I nearly left the house then remembered the police would be called if I did. His response was ""what do you want me to do I need to wash?!"". I tried to explain I am just overwhelmed and he said ""how do you think I feel?!"". It's clear he's not coping and as much as I'd like to be able to snap out of this I just can't. 

He also keeps asking me questions like ""what meals shall I plan this week?"", ""can you call the bank to approve this that or the other"", ""what gift shall I take to the birthday party she is going to tomorrow"", ""what are our plans for next weekend now that you're not well"". My head is literally fried, everything he asks I start to panic and get overwhelmed because I can sense the underlying frustration in his tone.

The chaos around me of the children and the mess in the house is adding to my guilt. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm a failure as a mother and partner. They need me so much and I just can't do what I normally do right now. How can I help him understand I'm not just being lazy? This is SO unlike me and I just don't know how to communicate what I'm going through.

He's not a bad man he is struggling. We're on our knees as a family.

Thanks if you've read this far.",
"I’m seeking advice on ways to prevent postpartum depression. I have three sons. My first, who is now 7, was very calm as a baby. He would eat, sleep, and cry very little. I could go anywhere with him without worrying about crying in public or feeling overwhelmed. 

However, my second child was the opposite—he cried almost 24/7, and it was exhausting both mentally and physically. My mom helped for a while, but after she left, I felt stuck at home. I couldn’t go anywhere because his crying was relentless, even in the car. My personality is quite introverted, so I avoided going out. I fell into a cycle of depression that lasted four years. It was such a difficult time, and I felt like I was losing control. I became paranoid about my health, convinced I had every disease, and went through multiple tests, including CT scans, MRIs, and colonoscopies. I knew I wasn’t well, but I felt powerless to stop it. Thankfully, as my son grew, he became a sociable, smart, and funny kid, and my mental health improved.

Recently, I had my third son about a month ago, hoping he would be more like my first. However, he cries a lot, and I’m experiencing the same challenges as before. I can’t take a shower, cook, or do anything for myself. He doesn’t sleep at night, and during the day, he only naps for 10 minutes before crying again. I’m terrified of slipping into depression once more, especially now that I have responsibilities towards my other children and need to complete my thesis by December. 

I love my baby so much, but I feel like I’m losing control again. I’m scared to do anything outside the house with him, even just going for a walk. I would appreciate any non-medication advice on how to manage this situation and prevent postpartum depression.",
"I’m 18 days pp and am really struggling. I caught my husband watching porn two days after I delivered our baby. I typically don’t mind that he watches porn but the timing just didn’t feel okay. Two days pp, I could barely walk, breastfeeding wasn’t working, I was in so much pain, and I was still trying to stay positive and be proud of what my body just went through for our baby. Instead of trying to help boost my confidence and make me feel good, he was watching porn with women who look nothing like me and who obviously didn’t just go through a traumatic birth. I know it’s just porn but I’m having a REALLY hard time looking at my body and feeling good about it now. I talked to him about it and he apologized for hurting me, but I can’t seem to get over it. All I do is cry and I feel extremely disconnected from my husband and my body. I don’t feel like I’m being the best version of myself for my baby. Any advice or thoughts?

Sincerely,
An Emotionally Exhausted FTM",
"Came across an interesting article about the cause of ppd. It suggests ppd is an autoimmune disease. They didn’t find differences related to hormones between depressed and non depressed women. Instead they found increased activity of immune cells and cells implicated in insulin resistance. 


Https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01525-7#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20we%20have%20performed,previously%20unreported%20in%20the%20literature.  

“In conclusion, we have performed the largest and most comprehensive biological interrogation of PPD, to date. Our results suggest that PPD is associated with an increase in B-cell activation, a finding previously unreported in the literature. While we do not know the precise mechanisms behind this increase in B-cell activation, we hypothesize it could be due to co-occurring dysregulation in [insulin resistance].”",
"I feel like the absolute worst mother in the world because I don’t have any patience left for my baby during the night.. 
He’s 11 months and has been waking up like CRAZY for the past month, and it usually takes me and my husband 2 hours to put him back to sleep. Nothing we do works. It’s so fucking frustrating. 
I’m writing this after having a major rage episode with him, after 2 hours of trying to put him to bed. I screamed so much at him, said some pretty hurtful and heavy stuff, and just threw him in the crib, like I couldn’t care less.. 
I’m treating ppd for a couple of months now, and it’s been great with the medication, but as soon as he has these long night wakes I lose my shit. 
I know I’m going to feel waaaay worse tomorrow, and I’ll just cry my eyes out for doing that to him. He’s probably gonna hate me or be afraid of me. 
I know it’s traumatizing doing that to him, and I do regret every single word I said, and the way I acted. But I just can’t “control” myself, I’m so tired and so done with this.


Note: I’m reading all the comments and I’m so thankful for this community ❤️ thank you all for understanding my situation and my feelings. I’ll try to answer every comment, but I just wanted to say a couple more things:
- Me and my husband are pretty much alone, our families live in another country.. So it gets pretty hard sometimes :(
- I love the idea of cosleeping, but whenever I try my baby just gets really agitated, and he keeps looking for me on the bed (even though I’m literally right there next to him, holding his hand). I cannot tell you guys how many times he slapped me, pulled my hair, head-bumped me, and so on.. So honestly and sadly I do think he’s going to sleep better in the crib. 
- I’m treating PPD with medication but I also have ADHD, which I also take medication for.. So for me it gets really hard to control my emotions when I get overwhelmed and overstimulated. I know it’s not an excuse, it’s more about context.
- We are currently trying the “divide and conquer” approach: if baby wakes up until 3am, my husband goes, and after that it’s me.. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it just makes us more tired. But we’ll figure it out!
- the main thing is that if it comes to a point where I’m feeling the rage and frustration coming, I’ll definitely put him in the crib and walk away. I still feel like shit for what I did and said to him that day, and it’s pretty hard to forgive myself. ",
"Has anyone had success with ECT? I’m 18 weeks postpartum and struggling with postpartum depression, anxiety and, insomnia. I’ve been hospitalized three times for insomnia and suicidal thoughts. I’m doing IV Ketamine right now, which has helped some, but not a ton. My psychiatrist is also looking into Zurzuvae. ",
"I'm backsliding hard into depression. My house is a mess. I'm working partime from home while still being primary care giver and my huaband keeps forgetting to do the things I asked. My aunt recently passed away unexpectedly and small things have been piling up on top of that. I'm one wrong move away from blowing my lid. 

If my husband jokes about me not doing anything around the house again I might just throw everything in the garbage. He can pull his clothes and all the dishes out of the fucking trash and I'll be sleeping in the car. 

My to do list is a mile long and all I ask is he take out the trash and the cardboard. Just those two things would make everything feel so much more manageable. ",

I just wanna get this off my chest once again tonight. I know I have been posting on Reddit about the same issue but who cares, I am so desperate for a little of care from people I do not know.

To keep it short, I just gave birth four months ago. I caught my partner cheating on me two months postpartum. He said sorry but never really done anything to help me get through the pain. We reconciled. But I haven’t really felt some sort of genuine apology from him.

I have been asking me to just atleast consider my feelings for our baby. Especially, I am the sole physically present parent for him. Knowing he is living 10 hours away from us due to his nature of work. I have been really understanding but I exploded for the nth time again tonight because I have learnt that he followed another woman’s alter account using his alter account which I find it bullshit.

I confronted him and he told me it’s just a woman he has known for a long time but I know that is not the case. Should it just be that, why follow using an alter account? And the fact that he has been one of the first people to be followed by the woman.

Now, we got into another argument and I just really do not know anymore. I feel like I am dealing with someone who cannot even change even just at least for the child involved.",
"I (m25) and my fiance (f24) had our baby 6 months ago. From the start she's been struggling with PPD. We've done so much to try to curve it. Multiple doctors, different meds, talk therapy, exercise. She isn't getting any better, I'd say it's only getting worse. It's at the point where I feel she's gonna hurt the baby, even if it were by accident. I'm struggling mentally and I don't know how to help her. I can't be there 24/7 to baby sit both of them. Please someone give me some sort of advice, anything",

"My newborn is wonderful, he’s a smart and chill baby. I love him so much it hurts. But I cannot seem to stop crying and mourning the pre baby relationship my spouse and I had. We love being parents don’t get me wrong, but I cannot seem to think about our life before our baby without crying. I wouldn’t change anything about right now obviously, but I think back and look back on pictures and the tears won’t stop.. does anyone feel like this too? ",
"I have an 8 week old baby who is so well behaved and wonderful. I love him more than anything in the world, but I hate what pregnancy did to me.

I’m not myself anymore. My body doesn’t feel like me. My brain has been rewired to the point where I don’t recognize the woman that I was before… and my spouse is starting to despise me for it. I can’t find the joy in my day to day life, everything that he says and does makes me sad. And I’m convinced that nothing I do will ever be enough for him anymore. We have fought more the in the last two weeks than we have in an entire year before the baby came.. but nothing ever comes to a resolution. I fucking hate it.

"I return to work in Dec. Im procrastinating calling for ppd care because I feel hopeless. Either way I have to return to work, I am the bread winner. Im resentful that I am the bread winner. I am resentful that my MIL gets to be with my babies. I am resentful that my husband is un phased that I have break downs that I have to leave my babies with his mom. I know the state of the economy isn’t ideal and we just bought a house, a new replacement car etc…we need to both work. 
But my ppd is hitting hard. Workplace accommodation seems pointless from what I was reading. I have horrible intrusive thoughts when I leave my children with anyone. Even my husband and he’s a great father. I had a traumatic birth and I was told this is it, I cannot have more children. I didn’t know if I wanted more children, but I wanted to at least decide that on my own. This topic is hitting me hard, but everyone Ive sooken to about it has made it a light subject and I just want to scream, also I feel like a bad woman? Or less of one having such trouble giving birth to my two kids. Both hemorrhaged hard and were emergency c sections. 
Im feeling less than. ",
"Been going through a lot already. No one to talk to during or after. His mom said I’m trying to hurt the baby by making myself puke, when it was bad morning sickness. Threaten to beat my ass but couldn’t bc I was pregnant telling me I didn’t try in labor ( I had trouble pushing I got induced and got a fever ) I was on IV Benadryl. Saying I didn’t try so I didn’t want my daughter. Then after birth took the baby gave it to my bf brother and said imma beat her ass. Saying I don’t deserve my daughter. I’m not a mother. I have no emotional attachment to her. Remind you she’s 3 months almost 4 months. Saying I don’t love her.  No motherly instincts. I was learning didn’t have a mom or dad growing up. Cried myself to sleep every night during pregnancy. I live with my bfs parents. I don’t want to because she acts like I’m not there. But bf says if I move out that it’s over. And going to use my mental health against me so then I won’t have her. Said all this and I’m selfish, lazy ungrateful, spoiled brat, crazy. After birth did the kitchen, grocery shopping, cleaning, laundry. Only good thing I have is my daughter. ",

"Since my son was born I have spent the last 4.5 months trying my best to be perfect and to make his world perfect. I went dairy free and limit my soy intake because I sensed he may have a cow milk protein allergy. I stopped working so that I could give him my full attention. Every minute of every waking day I spend making sure he is happy and healthy. I haven’t had fun or me time in so long that I forgot what it feels like to let go a little bit.

Last weekend my family had a family reunion and I drank alcohol. I dumped a few rounds of pumped milk because I knew that it would be compromised milk. However, while drinking I started hitting my sisters nicotine vape pretty heavily over the course of the weekend. Always when he was asleep and outside of the house. It never NEVER crossed my mind that nicotine enters breast milk. I didn’t even think twice about it. Not once. So for three whole days I hit this e cig and was feeding my son, some of it was dumped I’m not sure how much of the nicotine infused milk was dumped. I produce a lot so we’ve been feeding him milk from that time frame over the week.

This week we noticed his sleep take a serious turn for the worse. Irritability and screaming and just acting very weird. He hasn’t pooped in a while so that’s what I thought it was. It was only a few days ago that I had the realization to google nicotine in breastmilk and discovered what a piece of shit I am.

I can’t even look in the mirror. I can’t look at him. I can’t move on. My husband is urging me to try to forgive myself and move on but I can’t. Because who does this to an innocent helpless baby who needed me? He more than likely developed a small addiction and is withdrawing from it, he can’t sleep anymore without being held all night long. I’m sick and fucking disgusted with myself and I don’t feel like I deserve to breathe air anymore. He deserves a better mother. Someone who wouldn’t even be tempted by bullshit like an e cig. I hate myself and want to disappear. I don’t think I will ever be able to move on from this for the rest of my life. He is the greatest gift of my entire life and I fucking ruined him by introducing harmful chemicals into his little body. 

I don’t know what I’m even looking for here. I wanted to call my mom and vent but I’m ashamed. I don’t even want to tell my therapist because I’m so embarrassed of my actions. ",
"TLDR; after 3.5 years being with my kid nearly 24/7 99% of their life …I am now 50/50 co-parenting and I don’t miss my kid when she’s at Dad’s. I’m not even inclined for goodnight face times. I feel bad that I don’t miss her or want to call her. 

My kid is 3.5. I am co-parenting, and have been emotionally separate from the dad since I was pregnant and physically separated since kid was 2.  The whole post partum so far has been tough on me, I did not get a lot of support emotionally or even physically at all-  hence the separation. I pretty much was a totally single mom. I did everything with very little offer for help, not even help around the house!!  I also was EBF. Pandemic baby. 

The first time I even was away from my kid EVER they were already 1.5 and I had to practically beg with over a month’s notice for him to watch her alone so I could have my first girls day/ DAY OFF since I gave birth. 

When she was around 3 and I was EXHAUSTED, separated and nagging Dad to please take her, I had realized I have been physically and even a large portion of the time skin to skin with my kid for 3 years straight minus MAYBE 2 weeks out of the entire time.  

I also wfh and cannot afford childcare. 

In the last month or so he is now finally getting more consistent with the schedule and he’s been taking her about 50/50.  

Now that I am getting real time for myself sometimes I realize I go all day and  I don’t even miss my kid. Today I realized the whole day went by and I didn’t even have desire to call for goodnights. I feel bad about it. some post of moms here that really struggle doing custody split and I am here not even thinking about my kid at all. 

Is this normal? I feel like I should be missing my kid more and wanting to call her but I figure dad’s time is his time and I don’t want to interrupt or make her emotional seeing me because we have attachment style and I know it’s hard for her. 

Dad of course is a nuisance with constantly FaceTiming 2-3 times a day during my time. I honestly detest it. My kid also hates it she will literally kick and scream crying that she doesn’t want to talk. So I figure she doesn’t even like FT so why stress her out? So I am rarely initiating FT but Dad insists that she say good night to me. So he does FT me usually every night he has her (she never fights him on it like she does with me.) Tonight I could tell she miss me she was trying not to cry. I felt like it would been better for me not to FT but he texted saying “she wants to say goodnight” but I honestly don’t think she even brought it up, I am sure he is the one that suggested it. 

I don’t know why he insist on FT and is so adamant about the good night every night. Like she literally rejects him and cries EVERY TIME but he still forces the FT every night. I hate it. I just want my time and his time and not have to facilitate face times. Am I wrong to feel this way? (there is no court order or plan. We are not involving courts)

Should I miss my kid more? I feel like it’s probably normal given the context but also feels not normal. I feel like I SHOULD want to call and at least say goodnight but I honestly don’t think it’s necessary.

"I’m a little over 9 weeks PP and I’ve been lying to myself that I’m fine. My husband was on paternity leave which was actually very helpful but he just went back to work, this is my second week solo parenting a toddler and a baby. I feel so absolutely defeated today. I just have this inner voice telling me I’m a bad mom, I’m a bad person, and things will never get better. I am a mental health professional and I know this is just postpartum depression talking but I just can’t shake this awful feelings of self doubt and just an overall sickness towards myself. I never felt such low lows with my first and I wasn’t expecting it, especially at 2 months postpartum. Sometimes I just wish I could disappear. I really don’t have a support system aside from a few friends and my husband (I have little to no family). I am in therapy and I’m toying with the idea of antidepressants, but in the moment things just feel so terrible and I just feel so alone and in such a dark place. Just ranting, had to get it off my chest. Thanks for listening. ",
"Firstly I want to thank everyone in this group that helped me get through some very tough time.
A few months ago my wife went through extreme post partum depression with two episodes and being sectioned twice. Dozens of suicide attempts.

As a father and a husband who was just blessed with twin babies, boy and a girl. It was a very tough time. 

I am pleased to tell all of you my wife is finally back home and finally smiling and living her normal life. When even going out for grocery shopping looked impossible, we are travelling together with our twin babies.

For all the mums and dads struggling with post partum depression, remember it gets better. No matter how hard it gets, it will get better. Trust your health providers but be involved in decision making for your partner. At the end remember they need you. You have to give your 110%. I used to work from 9-5 and spend 5-12 at the hospital with my wife.
With mental health medicines, they take time. At the end stay strong and have faith.

"Huge rant, no sugar coating.
I'm writing this after finally breaking down and crying at work. I've been lying to my self, telling my self that I'm fine, I'm not that overwhelmed, I can do the work I was doing before, I don't need help. But, I'm not fine, I've never been more overwhelmed, I cannot mentally handle the work I was doing before, and I need help.
We are so important to the survival of the human race, yet I have to continue to act like everything is fine after ripping my insides out and going through some of the hardest (yet one of the most common) experiences of PSTD?
I have to get up and feed my baby on demand for months on months, wait to shower for days, chose between eating my first meal of the day or peeing for the first time that day, yet there are still men who can't understand why we need a break?
Why is it, thousands of years into being mothers, we still feel like we have to hide? Like we have to lie to ourselves? That we have to fight these postpartum fights on our own? 
I looked back on my photos, I finally see what people are saying. I look like I'm not okay. I'm not my self. Why does it feel like I'm trained to lie and avoid that fact? 
Please recommend some books, tell me your thoughts, someone's got to be as frustrated as me, right?",
"I had my c-section a week ago, and my relationship with my husband is now stained. Maybe it’s the postpartum depression, or maybe it’s something else. It all started one day after the c-section, I was still stuck on the hospital bed and my mother in law came visit. She was holding my baby, and he started crying so my mother took him from her so I could breastfeed him. Her face dropped and my husband told me to tell my mother to let his mother mind the baby as she would only be in the country for 3 weeks. I appreciate her flying all the way here, and wanting to help and all but I just prefer my mum’s help. I was falling asleep then I overheard my husband talking to his mother saying my mom had been a great help and all but she should leave and stuff, to add to that my husband had been frosty to my dad as well, so I broke down and told my mum about that. My mum cried but she tried to calm me down as well, then left to let my mother in law mind the baby. The second day after the surgery, I broke down again because I don’t like how she treats the baby like he’s hers. She didn’t mention to him about me, she didn’t hand him back to me so I could feed him when he started crying, instead she offered him a bottle without letting me try to breastfeed him first, and also she has a cold  and runny nose but not bother to wear a mask (my baby and I eventually caught it from her). I broke down and told my husband I wanted to hold my baby, he told his mom not to take it personally and that I wanted to hold my baby as I haven’t gotten to much. His mum left the room and for once there were just the baby, my husband and I in the room. After a while my husband went to check on his mum and he found her crying in the hallway. So I felt like she tried to make it about herself once again. She did that on our honeymoon as well. She decided to complain about me to my husband, saying she couldn’t get to know me, how we didn’t have deep enough conversations while I thought we were fine. After that I felt more self-conscious around her, I felt like I have to ask questions for the sake of asking questions otherwise she would go and tell my husband. I don’t hate her or anything, but we weren’t close to begin with so I just feel awkward and tense whenever she’s around, and she was around every afternoon during our hospital stay up until the last day when I had enough and just walked out of the hospital room. She then got upset and my husband blamed me saying I was being rude and so on. And he went back home with his mum that night. I just felt like he always put his mum first, even before checking into the hospital, he kept asking me whether he has to sleep at the hospital with me, he said he worried how his mum was going to get food and stuff as she was/is staying in our house (i already taught her how to use food ordering app). The next day my husband came back to the hospital just before we checked out, we had a talk and I told him how I felt around his mum. He said I was being a nightmare and I should grow up. We got back home and his mum decided to check herself into a hotel, and my husband said it’s because of me. I decided it would be better for me to go to my hometown for a while as I felt depressed, sleep deprived and I just need my mum’s help. I told him that and we had another talk, and this time it really changed the way I feel towards him. I told him I can’t do this alone, and that I need my support system. He said I’m incapable and that he’s disappointed in me. He said now that the baby’s here, I have to clean the house, mind the baby, cook him food and so on. His voice was cold when he said that, like he’s a different person. I asked him how does he expect me to do everything when my stitches weren’t even fully heal and that I’m sleep deprived, he said he doesn’t care and it’s my job, which I know it’s my job and I have no problem doing that, but hearing that from his mouth really took me by surprise. I said I felt like he has changed and he said he had put up with my mood swings for 9 months during the pregnancy, and now he expected me to stop having mood swings and step up. He said him being nice to me got him nothing, and that I was being ungrateful to him by not cooking food the last while, which I wasn’t aware of as whenever I asked him what he wanted for food, he always said it’s okay and that he wanted me to relax instead of cooking. And he complained that I changed a lot since I got pregnant, how I didn’t go to social events with him anymore, in my defence, I gained a lot of weight and didn’t want to be seen, he understood back then and said it’s okay but now he claimed it’s an issue. It’s been a few days now since we had that talk, he eventually agreed to let me go to my hometown with my mum next week and he’s been trying to act as caring as before as both our moms are still here in the house with us, but I can’t get over what he said. Also I feel like his feeling for me is different now. Like he only asked about our baby, how’s the baby, and nothing about me. He used to kiss me goodbye before work everyday and now there’s nothing. I feel like I’m just a baby sitter in my own house. Not the postpartum experience I thought we would have. I’m afraid this is the end of us. I’ll be away from him for a month and I don’t know what would happen when I come back, there’re so many things that he said that took me by surprise already. ",
My baby is a disabled 3 month old and I love him very much and I would say I'm a good parent his needs are met and I spend a lot of quality time with him talking reading singing tummy time etc. but lately I've been feeling burnt out I've had a bad marriage  with the baby's father that ended in separation because he refused to set any boundarys with a women who is in love with him and now shes living with him they are not in a relationship and I'm 70% certain he's just a pushover  but she makes it impossible for us to co parent because she screams at him for coming to watch the child and he says it was my fault for being so mean to her when I noticed they were doing weird stuff so now he doesn't take the baby ever he is starting fights with me because of this women when I've told him to just leave me out of it and Ive gotten so depressed  because all i do is care for my baby who is very high needs so i dont have time to eat shower sleep or anything I haven't showered in 2 weeks I eat a meal every 2 days if I'm lucky I get 3-4 hours of sleep a night i only leave the house for his appiontments ive had a headache and nausea for 3 weeks straight and I don't even have time to see a doctor as Ive got health problems myself the stress of this weights on me so heavily and i dont have any support since my ex husband "can't" help im afraid im going to hurt myself and the only reason i dont is because i believe im the only person who can properly care for my disabled son even when I have these horrible thoughts of giving him away I think about how even in the hospital I had to keep track of my sons proper health and that if I gave him away I would be subjecting him to pain and suffering because they won't know how to care for him the way I do I just wish I could have even a day to myself ,
"Im exactly 1 week postpartum and it's been hard just bearing the ppd in silence today. My bf is amazing and supportive, however I feel the need to ""protect"" him from the crazy that is about to unfold with how raw my nerves and emotions are. I can feel the depression building and as soon as he walks out of the door tomorrow I am going to erupt in wailing and tears until I can fall back asleep. 
As usual after giving birth I have 0 support other than him, no family or friends visiting, its just me, 4 walls, my newborn and resounding silence that echoes and goes on for hours. Ruminating about how alone i am in the world except for bf. Im lacking a woman in my life though and lacking that care that a female relative or friend gives- Instead its just me caring for everyone, no one spoon feeding me and waiting on me hand and foot as it should be, if only for a day here and there.
I can't wait for him to leave for work in the morning so that I can let it all hang out, I want to cry and sleep all day without anyone around to be freaked out or upset by the ppd on display. 
It's so all consuming, it's like all of the grief I've ever felt is hitting at once, all of the lack and the absence of things that are missing pieces in my life has me feeling helpless. Feeling the absence of a sensitive feminine and caring/nurturing presence in my life. Or the hope that my social and emotional needs will ever be met. Bf is only a man and only one person and he does enough to support our household financially so it's just a void I'm falling into.. having to carry on as usual as if my organs dont feel like theyre prolapsing and I don't feel like fainting and or crying half the time. 
I'm also an addict in recovery and thoughts of using and or killing myself are creeping through my psyche. Even though I love my children and bf, I feel insecure sexually and undesirable and that is fucking with me. Like how can I actually be thinking that my bf would be happier if I were gone and he could replace me as a mother with someone who is more sexually attractive. I don't deserve him and I can't be everything he wants or needs probably. Shit that creeps through my thoughts even though it's irrational to think this way. 
",
"Does it ever get better?  I really don't want to live like this.  It's disgusting to have my organs falling out of my body and I'm sure that my husband hates it, because he's squeamish.  I'm doing a belly wrap, but don't know if it'll make things better.  I had milder DR with my first pregnancy, and it never really got better even with wraps and exercise.",
"Hello Angels on earth..

I’m 4 weeks postpartum, and I should be happy, soaking in these precious moments with my newborn. But instead, I feel crushed and drained, mostly because of my mom. My parents flew in from another country to help during pregnancy and after delivery. They’ll be here until December (the tickets are already booked), but honestly, I don’t know how I’m going to survive until then.

I just had my first baby, and instead of feeling supported and loved, I feel like I’m drowning in judgment and negativity, especially from my mom. During pregnancy, she constantly accused me of betraying my family and being selfish, all because I wasn’t bending over backward for people who never even cared about me. She doesn’t like my husband—she never has. Where we’re from, love marriages are still frowned upon, and because my husband isn’t some rich, fair-skinned guy, she can’t stand him. It’s like no matter how good he is to me, she can’t see past her outdated ideals.

She stressed me out so much during pregnancy, and I feel like it’s happening all over again now that I’m postpartum. It’s like she can’t stand to see my husband helping me. She makes these snide comments and gets angry when he’s by my side, even though he’s just trying to take care of me and the baby. My sibling, who’s been staying with us and paying rent, isn’t much better. They don’t like my husband either. It’s this constant tension in the house, and they’re always upset when my husband’s parents want to check in on us or see their grandchild. It’s their first grandchild, and they just want to be involved, but every time they call, my mom and sibling give me this disapproving look.

The worst part was during delivery. It was so rough—at one point, the doctors were trying to save me and the baby, and my husband was scared. He needed support, so he called his family to keep them updated, which is completely understandable. But as soon as I was moved to my room, my mom found a way to make it about her. She told me she didn’t like how my in-laws were being “updated” about the situation. I mean, I had just given birth—my life and my baby’s life had been at risk, and all she could think about was how she didn’t like that my husband called his parents? I was too exhausted to fight with her, but it hurt.

It’s the same story every day. My in-laws call to check on me and the baby because they care, and every time, my mom gets upset. She even told me once that she feels like they’re “keeping an eye on her,” like this is some sort of power play. I’ve tried telling her over and over that no one is watching her, no one cares what she’s doing—they just want to see their grandchild! But she keeps making me feel like I’m in the middle of some tug-of-war, and it’s exhausting.

To make things worse, after we came home from the hospital, my husband started sleeping in the same room as me to help with the baby at night. We were both so tired, emotionally and physically drained from everything. But my mom came in and told us she didn’t like it. She said we shouldn’t act like a couple anymore, that our life has changed, and we’re supposed to be different now. I just couldn’t believe it—after everything we’d been through, she still finds ways to criticize us.

I’m so overwhelmed. I know I can’t ask them to leave because their tickets are booked for another two months, but I don’t know how I’m going to survive this. Every day feels like I’m being judged for trying to live my life, for loving my husband, for just trying to recover from everything. I can’t even enjoy being a mom because all of this is weighing me down so much. I don’t know what to do anymore—I just feel so alone in this.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to comment and support. I appreciate it more than you know. Right now, I just need to feel like someone understands what I’m going through.",
Im two weeks pp and lately I’ve felt really sad and emotional. I just want to disappear sometimes for just a bit. I love my baby thought and I’ve never experienced this before with my first. ,
"I’ve never used Reddit so I’m not sure what the etiquette is - but I need advice/help. I’m 6mo postpartum with my first and I’m experiencing ppd, no doubt. But I also think it could be post partum rage. That, or I’m just a bitchy, lazy mother. Idk. 

My husband does pretty much everything. I absolutely love my baby, I just cannot feel the “want” to do things like baths, diapers, putting baby back to sleep, etc. Not all of the time, but most of the time I just would rather my husband do it. It’s just that I feel exhausted all of the time - mentally and emotionally. But I have no reason to be physically exhausted from the baby because my husband does 85% of the tasks/care. 
I want to want to. I want to not be so frustrated after the baby cries for three minutes. I just get so irritated over EVERYTHING and irrationally angry. Then I feel guilty because none of my friends seem to have experienced or feel this, my husband is frustrated by my lack of initiative, and I’m mad at myself for not wanting to. Which circles to “am I not enjoying motherhood?” Then “I’ve taken all this time for granted” 

I also find myself mourning my life before having a baby. Even though I literally do the same things. Partially, I’m being dramatic probably. But I really just don’t know what to do or what to think. I feel guilty. I’m anxious all of the time. I’m tired from work (I teach middle school, first year). I’m just unsure of what to do, what to say, what to think. And how to not feel like I’ve wasted the last few months being mentally absent. ",
"I often find myself wondering what I did to deserve the innocent and pure love my baby gives me. I got very lucky with the perfect baby. She’s beautiful, she’s not a crier at all and she sleeps wonderfully. 

I just feel guilty and I don’t know why. We will be playing and she will be giggling so much, and then just a wave of sadness hits me and I start thinking about will I ever be good enough for her? Will I be able to provide everything that she needs to be happy?  often when she’s just sleeping on my chest, the overthinking starts and I start feeling sad again, she will wake up and just look at me with a sad face and sometimes kinda starts light crying. Sometimes it just feels like she knows what I’m
Thinking and how I’m feeling and it affects her and that also just makes me feel terrible. If my mom or sister is here I pass her on to one of them so she just feel my sad energy. Does anyone else feel like this? ",
,
"I’m honestly so bad at everything. I’m having trouble seeing the point in trying. I’m not good at being a wife anymore because I feel so useless and taken advantage of and I’m so negative and unlovable that my husband doesn’t want to help me. I’m not good at being an employee because I’m a mom, I’m not good at being a mom because I’m trying to keep my job. I don’t have any hobbies anymore. I don’t have any real friends in the state. My family won’t help. I don’t know if I enjoy any part of my life at this point. 

I wish I didn’t have a life insurance policy. I wish my student loans wouldn’t go away if I died. I wish I could be better for my daughter. ",
"I’m a little over 6 weeks postpartum and have started therapy. I have always had bad anxiety and panic attacks but it was pretty controlled prior to pregnancy and birth. Anyway, I’m wondering if anyone else has had almost obsessive and compulsive spiraling thoughts of dying and leaving behind your kid(s) and then have severe panic about it? I know it’s horrible for my mental health, but I keep googling the chances of me dying from something. Especially birth?? I’m honestly paralyzed by it and isolated in these thoughts. I can’t be present for my daughter or husband because I am living in the worst anxiety over it all. And my therapist has tried to logic me into thinking more positive but I can’t be. I have this thought too that because I have never heard of anyone personally dying of child birth it’s gonna be me. I’m not even pregnant or looking to get pregnant again anytime soon. Anyone else? Anything that helped? I think I’m going to up my meds. 

Thank you for listening with compassion. I definitely feel crazy right now. ",
"I feel ugly unless reflected by your eyes
Your words
Your voice

I can’t see the light but I remember the warmth on my face
Why can’t I feel ok

I’m supposed to be everlasting strength
Against an ocean that will bring us all under if I don’t give and take

How much I shoulder as you sit and complain
How much I suffer with a big smile on my face 

I’m shaking and breathing and feeling it all 

How much I fear the dark waters
And how I dread the fire
I’ll see it when I finally give in

Every bad word a chip in my soul
Another piece I can’t give 
Another piece I can’t lose

The shame 
I’m supposed to be good at this

My ppd has gotten so much better with medication and tool! If you want to know some tools feel free to comment or dm me. I’m here to talk always ,
"I have two children. An almost 4 year old and I just gave birth this year to my second. I’ve been trying to find work within the past month but haven’t heard anything back yet. I’ve just been staying home taking care of the kids and the house and what not. I feel like I’m suffering from postpartum depression or maybe just depression, idk. I do want to seek help but I want to be sure I’m showing the signs or something. I’ve been binge eating, snacking. I thought it was due to me breastfeeding but now I’m thinking maybe not bc I just visited the doctor and realized I gained weight. I’ve also noticed I’ve been very impatient with my toddler and I feel bad for it. I feel like I’m being so mean bc I’m just not feeling well. I sometimes find myself just feeling blank. If that makes sense. Like emotionless sometimes. I don’t feel like hurting anyone or myself. But I just feel like I have no emotion at times. The past few wakes have also been off with the children’s sleeping schedule, so idk if that is what’s affecting my impatience. What are your experiences with ppd? ",
"I feel better…then I don’t. I don’t at all. My PMS is severe. My depression swings back after a month of being ok. It lies to me and I in turn lie to my family that I’m ok and better. I still hear voices saying they would be better off without me. I still see things when I close my eyes that scare the shit out of me. I’m so far into this. When does it end. I’ve got a therapist, I’ve been medicated, over medicated, medicated again and that medication that worked affected other things that ultimately led me to quit. I’m scared. I’m scared I’m going to lose my life. My husband and family as it could be. I’m terrified.

Doctors tell me there is nothing wrong….it’s like a freaking dagger and actually crushing because it is solidifying that I am a fucking lunatic. I’m the problem. ",
"Hi everyone. I am 7 months postpartum and feeling very down. I was diagnosed with OCD at 3 months postpartum and figured that my depression symptoms were simply just secondary to the OCD. Now, I’m feeling more down than ever and am desperately trying to feel like myself.

I’m wondering is PPD can present as feeling completely unlike yourself and like you are doomed forever?  I just don’t see a way out of this headspace that I’m stuck in. I have so many negstive thoughts in my head about my ability to be a mother, and even whether or not I want to be a mother. I feel like such a failure and i so desperately want to get back to the moments where I felt connected to my baby, and to my loved ones. 

I guess im looking for hope, validation, etc. my OCD brain is telling me that this is never going to end. I had a very smooth pregnancy and was so excited to be a mum. I had a wonderful first few months with my son before the OCD hit.

Thank the everyone - I truly don’t wish any postpartum mood disorder on anyone. It is absolutely the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through and I spend everyday in a panic that I won’t ever feel like myself again. ",
"So I suffered a lot after my daughter was born and my husband was really great while it took me over a year to get better. Now I’m pregnant with our second and I’m scared I will feel the same again after the birth. How was ist for you? Did PPD/PPA repeat exactly the same after your second pregnancy or was it not as bad? Is there anything I can do to “prevent” it? Happy to hear stories, recommendations and vents! ",
"I'm six weeks postpartum and I don't know what pregnancy did to me, but I feel so dumb all of the time. I used to be really good with words, had no issue with remembering things, and was competent. Now, I say the wrong things, forget and stumble over my words, forget everything two seconds later, sometimes in mid sentence, and it seems like I can't do the simplest tasks. 

It doesn't help my PPD or the fact that I keep having suicidal thoughts off and on. I started seeing a councilor, and she's nice, but may not be the correct one for me. I was seriously contemplating suicide, I had my plan, when I asked my husband to call offices on my behalf, they were the only ones who could get me in on short notice,  i was supposed to see someone the next day. I filled out the paperwork as soon as it was sent, but they forgot to process it until we called them a week later to ask why no one had called like they said they would (my gp even called to make sure the process was expedited). 

The first appointment, the councilor just asked me about the birth of my daughter, while was really traumatic. It didn't take her until my second appointment yesterday to actually look at my paperwork and see the boxes I had checked, which had my GP, OB, and husband scared I would do something harmful to myself. 

Honestly, the only thing keeping me here is the knowledge that if I died, my husband probably wouldn't be far behind. If that happened, I don't know what would happen to our daughter, and I don't want her placed into the system. We don't really have a village.

",
"It was recommended by my dr that I start taking antidepressants. For those of you that do take it, does it really help & how so? ",
"I feel like I’m losing myself more and more everyday. Sometimes I have good days and sometimes bad days. My LO is 8 months and teething so nap times are here and there. I feel as if I get no time to myself to clean the house or anything. & all my boyfriend complains about is how much he works. Mind you he pays no bills and only thing we have to do is save for LO. He comes home and plays the game, and sometimes might grab the baby.
I’m thinking about leaving him, I’m not really sure what’s keeping me in the relationship anymore. Can someone help me see the bright side of a two parent household??",
"Warning; trigger.

I start Zurzuvae in a few weeks and I can't wait. My life is a joke and all I want to do is not exist. I can't even find joy in my daughter...I feel so guilty and alone.

Everywhere I go, no one treats me with respect or care. My job, my family, doctors. I am tired. I am so so so tired.

Idk what I'm going to do if these meds don't work.",
"My boyfriend is growing to hate me. He told me he doesn’t like being around me very much anymore because I’m so unpredictable. Neither of us are working right now and him being home with me 24/7 is taking a toll on us. I’m moody and easily agitated all the time… I’m also pretty sure I’m struggling with postpartum rage more than I am with depression (but I have been depressed for as long as I can remember). I love this man more than anything. I’m so scared he is going to give up on me. I’ll get better for a day or two and then something will happen that triggers me and I feel like I’m right back where I started. The little family we have made together is all I have ever wanted in life. I’m currently 5 months postpartum and I’m worried I’m going to fuck up and ruin everything. I don’t know what to do, medication can only help so much… I have no friends anymore and I feel helpless. ",
"I feel like such a failure my whole pregnancy everything that could have gone wrong went wrong and same with postpartum the only thing I had that went as planned was my breast feeding I was so proud of myself baby was gaining weight good. But we went to his appointment and he’s below the 1st percentile. He’s eating g great and I’m producing enough but he has horrible GERD and I can’t find anything that helps I do the gas drops and the grips water I burp after so many oz I do the slow feedings I keep him upright he’s even on prescription meds for it. I have also completely changed my diet he’s only 11 pounds and some oz at 4 months old besides that he’s great he rolls from front to back and back to front he smiles and coos all the time he just discovered his feet so he’s been trying to eat those and he’s happy. I’m doing my best but it just isn’t good enough 

(He’s had an abdominal ultrasound and everything was good we even did a feeding one. He poops maybe once a day sometimes once every other day) 
I’m just so tired and I want him to be his healthiest self 
Any advice or words of wisdom? ",
"Hi all. 
Prior to being pregnant I had so much self confidence.

I’m 5 months PP and I’ve never felt so ugly. I absolutely hate how I look and have absolutely zero confidence in how I look or who I am as a person. I’ve never felt so ugly. I definitely would say I have PPD (not diagnosed) but I just constantly feel down. and cry so much. I feel like my husband, my baby, and my dogs deserve so much more. I hate feeling this way as I feel like I’m missing out on my baby’s life but it’s so hard to snap out of it. I love my baby so much but I’m having such a hard time adjusting to my new life ",
"Hi guys it seems when my sleep gets broken having to either tend to my 4 year old or 5 month  old for night feeds the next day I feel like I’m going to
Pass out , I’m light headed and just have a chest pressure like anxiety of exhaustion, event blurry vision sometimes .. anyone else relate or have tips ? I try to nap at least once during the babies naps during the day . ",
"I had a VERY traumatic pregnancy and urgent csection. Long story short, I was pregnant with mono-mono twins. One had a lethal brain condition and their cords were entangled the entire pregnancy. 

Our one baby girl passed away at 28 weeks therefore I had to have an urgent c-section. Our surviving twin  spent 102 days in 3 different hospital, 2 NICUs and 1 rehab.

I suffered with anxiety my whole life but when our one passed away, I was completely broken. (I forever will be) When our baby came home. I whole different type of depression hit. I thought ALL day of not wanting to be on this planet. I felt like everyone would be better off if I was not here. I would spend my days looking up postpartum depression stories and I came across one story of a woman who did not survive PPD. At that very moment, I felt like that was going to be my end. 

The next day, I called my husband and told him I needed to go to the hospital NOW. He came home and my mom took me to the hospital. Thankfully, although I had an awful ER experience, I had a wonderful stay. I was put on a medication better suited for me. I also stopped pumping. Let me tell you, sleep deprivation and not eating and having a baby with medical needs was terrifying.

After a 7 day stay, I went home. I was scared to be out of the hospital but I joined an IOP program and spent 11 hrs a week doing intensive therapy. I did this from April till July while working full time at home and taking care of our baby. Over time, I started feeling better. Its been almost 10 months and I feel like a new person. I enjoy going out, I even try to go out as much as possible. I enjoy seeing our baby look at the world. I enjoy the world. If you are in the thick of it, know that I was as well. I did not think I would survive. Here I am...surviving and loving life. Everyday is NOT perfect. I still have anxiety, but I am in a much better place. ",
"So my life before my son (10 mo. Old) was really crappy. I was in a bad situation right as I turned 18 and I never “learned” who I am or even how to adult. I got pregnant against my will and forced to keep him. I love my son more than anything but I feel like i don’t know who I am. I’m having a lot of emotional breakdowns because of it. I’ve been trying different things to see what feels like me and nothing does. I feel like a broken shell that will never be complete. I don’t even know where to start to find myself. I feel lost and alone but at the same time I feel like I can’t have those feelings because I see how it affects him. He crawls over to hug me and I start crying more. I haven’t told my boyfriend how I feel because I don’t think he’s understand and he gets mad when I talk about my past, not at me but at the people who did it but it still makes me feel like I can’t talk about it and I never even told him the stuff that made me mad, I only told him the stuff that barely affected me. How do you deal with life and being a mom after trauma because I feel like I’m drowning. Flashbacks are horrible, my son smacked me and I had a panic attack. He’s a baby, I shouldn’t be having a panic attack because a baby was flailing his arms and accidentally hit my face. Idk what to do, I love my little family but I just feel like a burden to them",
"LO is almost 6 weeks now, she was born at 36 weeks so we had challenges with latching since she was so small and also had jaundice till she was almost 3 weeks old. I almost exclusively pump on a schedule and only latch now if baby screams while i’m heating up milk or seems to want more after a bottle. 

Let me cut this short, I feel like me dying would be easier than this. I want to die. My breasts feels like it’s thrashed with pain as I write this because LO took was longer to finish a bottle and i’m now an hour late to pump on my schedule, probably a couple of plugged ducts there too. 

Usually I can count on my husband with his night shift so I can at least get uninterrupted sleep around 12-4am. But last night we had a fight because he was delaying his shift, was supposed to get LO from around 8ish but he took a nap and i let him until about 10pm. I woke him up as it was time for baby’s next feed and she was waking up. He got mad at me for not helping him warm the milk first before waking him up and questioning if i’m THAT tired that I couldn’t help with that one thing. I WAS WITH BABY THE WHOLE DAY from usually 4am and juggling pumping and her feeding schedule and diaper change and cleaning out bottles and pump parts in between trying to make the house look decent. 


I got so pissed and a part of me also feels guilty to my baby. It made me feel like a bad mom for needing a break and feeling exhausted. So I took her for the night and she’s been with me ever since. It’s now 9pm the following day. I haven’t gotten more than 2 hours of sleep at a time, my boobs are on fire and leaking everywhere, haven’t showered, only ate a cup of instant noodles and loaded up on caffeine. I guess if he wanted to help with whatever he wants at his own timing then fuck it. I’m not going to ask for help if he doesn’t care or have enough empathy or common sense to. Not too sure why moms taking care of her own child is just that but dads doing the same is called “helping”.

I don’t think I can take it anymore, this wasn’t what I imagined motherhood would look like. I don’t think i’ll ever want another. This has been hard but my maternity leave ends in about 2 months and I dread trying to juggle work and all of this when it’s time. I love my daughter to death, she’s the sweetest. And I, again, feel guilty for thinking of every suicide scenarios i can think of while caring for her all day today. 
",
"Forgive my rambling, I think I just need to vent. 

I can count on one hand the times my daughter cried. Three times at the hospital before we realized she was having latching issues, once during her first diaper rash, and once when we accidentally kept her up past her wake window.

She’s truly a dream baby. When she’s hungry, she’ll whine a bit— then immediately beam the brightest smile when she sees her father or I come to pick her up. 4 month old and I’ve woken up every morning terrified it’ll end, but no. She’ll keep me up until 2 am, sure; but with giggles and joy that I’d be happy to lose sleep to behold. I love her with every fiber of my being.

All this, all this joy, all her love, all my boyfriend’s love, the gift of motherhood I was never supposed to experience— and I’m a shell.

Empty and somehow simultaneously in absolute agony.

I broke down in front of her for the first time tonight. Through all my pain, I always smile when she looks at me. It didn’t matter if I had to choke back tears with suicidal thoughts in my brain, she never ever saw me cry. I broke down and would you believe it— my saving grace smiled at me. I saw the big, goofy, gummy smile and I broke. I laid her down, fell to the ground and wailed.

My boyfriend deserves better than the mess I am, my parents deserve better, and at the tippy too of it all— my daughter deserves better.

I haven’t showered in weeks, I never leave the house, I barely eat and live on cold water and nicotine (no, I’m not breastfeeding). I want to say I don’t recognize myself, but I’ve lived a life plagued with mental illness— honestly, I feel like I recognize myself now more than ever. I’m back in that dark place I found comfort in before I met my daughter’s father. I feel like I tricked myself into false happiness with the love of my life and our child. I love them, I am happy, I should be fucking happy. I’m so blessed, but why? My daughter is perfect, healthy. I am loved, I’m cared for and I am important, why can’t I let myself feel it?

I think about death way too often nowadays, but I could never do that to my family. My boyfriend is planning to propose soon, I’m an only child and my dad just recovered from cancer. My dogs starve themselves when I’m not around. I need to be here, I want to be here, but god why can’t I get the thoughts out of my brain?

Therapy, medication, I don’t have insurance and I’m on a fucking waiting list for therapy? I want to kill myself and I’m on a waitlist. I’m so emotional and cold and distant, I know it hurts my boyfriend because he doesn’t know how to handle it. What can I say? What do I tell him when he asks how he can help? There’s nothing, I don’t even know how to help myself. How do you say “dig me out” when there’s quicksand in your throat?

What do I do when there’s nothing to do? I literally can’t bring myself to leave the house, I can’t bring myself to do anything. I’m broken.

My partner needs me, my family loves me— but I’m too deep in the quicksand to hear their muffled cries. The only thing I hear through the fog is my daughter needing me. Her tiny little noises when she needs a change or wants a cuddle.

I thought I knew darkness before, but fuck— at least I could kill myself before. I don’t have that luxury now. I grew up without a mother, how could I let my baby go through that?

My boyfriend is struggling in his own way too, I know the change took a toll on his mental health— he works a strenuous job full time so I can stay home with our daughter. He works hard, he makes me breakfast, he helps with chores. What do I give him in return? Mood swings that hit like wrecking balls and an unclean home, a mess of a woman.

God, fuck. What is happening to me? I just want to feel the joy I know is surrounding me. My hair is falling out in literal clumps and I have a stress rash that I can’t seem to get rid of. I’m a fucking disaster. ",
"My weird ppd thing is I frequently spiral out of control worrying about whether my baby smiles. I think he does social smile now, at 4 months old, but I’m not sure because his smiles are usually pretty small and subtle. So maybe he isn’t smiling? It’s not the big gummy smiles I read about online that are supposed to make your heart melt. He did those before a couple times, but because they were rare I can’t be sure if those weren’t just gassy or pooping smiles. 
If he can smile but doesn’t, maybe that means he doesn’t like me or I can’t make him happy?
If he can’t smile, is there something wrong? 
Every time I think I’m out of this doom loop I just get right back into it a couple days later. ",
"Several months ago, I shared a lengthy post detailing my family's struggles with my wife's severe post-partum depression. In the time since, things have around the home only continued to deteriorate. After months of advocacy, I finally managed to get her to agree to attend weekly couples' counseling sessions with me. In between our second and third sessions, she hit me with the, ""I love you, but I’m not sure I still feel like I’m *in* love with you,"" and has since told me she doesn't feel like our marriage is worth saving.

She says things that are utterly detached from reality, things that baffle me in ways that are difficult to describe. She says she feels like she's left to do ""everything"" for our children on her own, but we've paid for full-time childcare (in addition to the support I provide) this whole time. She told our therapist I'm ""never there,"" but I work from home and rarely leave the house. She says she feels like she's ""on her own"" around the house, but I'm the one who does all the cooking, all the grocery shopping, most of the dishes, and most of the laundry. We probably split baths and diaper changes and the like for our kids 50/50. I also handle literally *every* administrative task for our household. When I try to remind her of these facts, she gets agitated and confrontational. I'm a doting and attentive father, and I regularly argue with her to get her *permission* to take them places with me. She's also spent significant time away (1-2 weeks at a time) from the family on multiple occasions. I have never done this.

She threatened to leave me when our first child was younger as well. I came home one day to a detailed custody plan and separation agreement just sitting on the table. So, in that sense, I've seen this before. On the other hand, though, there's something different about the exchange this time around. There's a finality that emanates throughout her words when she says it this time around, and I feel like I'm less effective at breaking through the fog the second time around. Likewise, when I try to stress to her that what she's saying isn't reflective of the lives we lead, it does not go over well at all, to say the very least.

Compounding matters, she's gone through a series of different therapists in recent months. Each one has offered a different diagnosis and, consequently, recommended a different medication. I'm sure these changes aren't helping. Moreover, whenever I express any interest in fostering her mental health, she responds with bitterness and scorn.

In truth, if it weren't for my children (3 1/2 and 1 1/2), I'd have left her a long time ago. I do my best to intervene when she's unfairly cross or contemptuous towards them, but it's clearly an unsustainable goal -- both because it weighs heavily on my own heart and because I can't always be around. 

In the past, she has punched me and shaken our older child in frustration. Each occurred only once, but I imagine that, if the shoe were on the other foot, once would be enough. When she shook our child, I was able to step in almost immediately to put a stop to it.  I know that such actions are indefensible -- PPD or no. If we separate, though, it will be an incredibly high bar to reach for me as a father to be awarded full custody of our kids, and I fear what could happen on those occasions when I'm not literally in the next room.

I have never felt more hopeless or helpless. I cry almost daily. I'm cognizant of the example we're setting for our children when it comes to how one should speak to people they love, and I fear the dysfunction that pervades our daily lives has impacted their development. Our older child is still not fully potty trained at 3 1/2, and our younger child still does not walk at 17 months.

I'm worn down. I'm not firing on all cylinders after spending years on end in full-on crisis mode. Leaving my wife would be the best thing for me as an individual, there's no question. But I genuinely fear what would/could happen to my children if I did. For that reason, pursuing divorce at this point strikes me as selfish and would make me a bad father. Still, my children deserve better than what they're getting/seeing/living on a daily basis, just as I deserve a partner capable of love and compassion and affection.

I don't know if I'm requesting advice or commiseration or reassurance from this group. Maybe I'm just hoping to unburden myself. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this far.",
"When I was pregnant- I had HG and Cholestasis, was miserable and sick- so I was too weak to give birth so I opted for a C section. I would feel faint just by walking far, and wanted my baby out safely. 
THEN- because I was so malnourished from being sick, I didn’t produce enough milk and then got a c section infection and could not breast feed. 

NOW I know and see so many moms with healthy pregnancies, perfect deliveries, and easy breastfeeding and I just feel like a failure. 

Anyone else felt the same? 
WE ARE NOT FAILURES. I just need to stop comparing. My baby is healthy ( thank god for that miracle) and that’s all that should matter , so why do I do this to myself?j",
"I’m so fucking depressed. I just want to sleep all day. But I can’t because I just have to take care of the baby. 

It’s not supposed to be like this. I don’t have a partner. My family can’t help much. I just want to cry. I love him, and I don’t want anyone else to have him, but at the same time I just need a break. 

My pregnancy was rough and traumatic. My birth was traumatic. My postpartum was traumatic. I don’t know how much else I can take. It’s just one thing after another and I’m sick, again, and I just want to sleep. 

It’s taking everything in my power to not just feed him, change him, put him in the pack and play and go sleep for 3 hours. 

Seems like I have no other choice",
"It's not the dogs fault. It's not my dog I've had to move in with family while waiting on my own place and it's hard I want nothing else but to have my own space.
I made it clear before I gave birth the dog and baby don't get left alone together because neither understand boundaries and I know the dog would never deliberately hurt the baby but accidents happen.
Last week the dog accidently jumped on the baby twice on separate days and made the baby scream and cry (no major injuries to the baby). Both times the baby was being changed by me and the dog got overly excited and jumpy and I'm starting to hate the dog because of it. The owner of the dog has been there when the dog jumps on the baby and I've had multiple near misses where I can push the dog before it lands on the baby but then I feel horrible for pushing the dog.
 I still give the dogs treats and make sure the dog has their meals but it's not my dog and I no longer want to stroke or even look at it. I feel terrible because the dog is lovely and just wants attention but I just can't anymore.
It doesn't help the second time the dog jumped on the baby I grabbed the baby to check for injuries (it was more shock crying than anything only one slight scratch) and the baby was taken out of my arms so someone else could settle her like I can't be trusted to reassure and calm down my own baby. 
I can't wait to move out and not be angry at an innocent animal.
I'm having other issues and get mad at other people and hate them but I don't care about them I just feel so guilty about the dog. I love animals it's not their fault",
"My fiancé and I have a 6 month old baby girl and he works up north - one week on, one week off. (This week he is gone for 9 days, due to some training he needs) I am alone with baby for these weeks obviously and I need to figure out how to make the time go faster. I have been struggling so much being so lonely, in the postpartum trenches and picture this.. I have Social anxiety (so I want nothing more than to go out and get together with friends, but I’m just too scared), I have severe crippling Anxiety AND to boot I have Postpartum Depression. I also have no family nearby. To say I’m struggling would be an understatement. My fiancé is the most amazing man on the planet and is so helpful when he’s home, he’s also there for me and a huge support when he’s gone. But bottom line… I’m alone with all of this and I’m in such a dark place. 

What are some ways I can get through this time  (with him away) as fast as possible. Any tips or tricks other than the usual.. “routine, get out, get a hobbie, etc.” ",
"How do you get through each day/hour feeling like this. My ppd and ppa is so bad and days like today I couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t look at our daughter without spiraling. My husband is incredible and takes care of her while I’m incapacitated like this but that makes me feel terrible too knowing he has to take it all on. I’m almost 4w pp and it just feels like there is no way through. I’ve had SI and I’m on meds and I have therapy scheduled (still a week out) but I still feel like I’m drowning. 
Then there’s the added pressure to keep up with all the friends and family wanting to see my daughter and us.  how does this not destroy every aspect of your life??! I don’t know how I’ll be able to work in a few months and deal with these feelings. It’s just all too much 
I know people say it gets better but I don’t know how I can be a non functioning human/parent/wife for months and not have everything be gone and ruined when or if I finally get out of this",
" Looking for help. I’m 7m pp, only got depressed a few months after my lovely baby was born. Life feels like a complete chaotic mess right now. 

I’m so depressed, and I’m already on antidepressants and doing therapy. This week I’ve started having sui*id*l thoughts and feel so much worse. I’m afraid if I admit how I feel it’ll be a safeguarding issue and social services will get involved. I still take care of my daughter well and she is so loved.

I just can’t shake the feeling she should have been given a better, less broken, mentally ill mum. I’ve struggled with my mental health for years, not just since having her. Maybe I should have listened to others who thought I couldn’t do it, I can’t do it. ",
"My boyfriend (38m) is a great guy, he’s a very present and engaging father and he works hard and takes care of most of the expenses. 

I (30F) am on disability and not working, saving the little money I get and I take care of most of the baby care. 

When my boyfriend does have free time, he works on my old Jeep, which I didn’t ask him to, but I guess it’s nice. It’s just, I have so many things to do that I would appreciate a hand with—if he’s not going to help with chores at least take the baby and let me do it in peace. 

And here’s the thing, he’ll do it—but I either have to ask or be pushed to point of exhaustion/rage for him to help out. Why can’t he just help out without me asking?

He had a migraine the other day—I removed the baby from disturbing him, I brought him water, electrolytes, coffee and oatmeal without him asking—he slept in until 3pm. I even felt bad about how hard he works and how poorly he was feeling that I bought him some stuff from REI as a thank you gift. 

It’s just annoying that I feel like the thoughtfulness isn’t reciprocated, but I’m not sure I’m in a place to complain about it because it’s not like he doesn’t do anything or he’s a lowlife—he’s just not very thoughtful. 

When he leaves the house, it feels like a clamp off of my head and I can breathe because at least there isn’t another body in the house doing nothing to help with the things that need to get done. 

Like, when I ask for help with laundry, he’ll just bring down the dirty laundry and toss it in the laundry room. Doesn’t start it, doesn’t even put it in the washer. 

It’s just little things like that that irk me. ",
"I had my son, our fourth child, in July at 36/37 weeks. My pregnancy was high risk because it was my 4th c section, I have a blood disorder, I developed gestational diabetes and my son had a single umbilical cord. The last month of pregnancy I had a weekly ultrasound and had to switch providers because mine was extremely unprofessional. My son was born and went to the NICU within 2 hours and stayed their for 2 weeks. We live 30 minutes away from the hospital so I wasn't able to be with my son daily. It was torturous, I cried constantly and could hardly function. Then we brought him home and I feel totally disconnected. I feel so bad for him, he doesn't deserve this. I am a monster. ",
"I'm a ftm, since baby was about a month old she's taken between 90-180mls from bottle as per midwife wanting 180 since baby wasn't gaining weight. Combo boob, boob milk and formula. She is now mostly boob milk and formula as breast is mainly comfort and sleep. (She's 2 months and nearly 11wks)
Today was warm and her soft spot has sunken, I've tried to push the bottle a bit more because I know baby is dehydrated and she redused. BUT she's also drooling so much, I called plunket health line and they said it's okay because she's drooling. I can't help but lay here in bed feeling like crap that I'm dehydrating my baby. I just need a mom vent support. � Am I doing this right?

Edit: Dr suggested water after feeds if we suspect baby is dehydrated. The Dr said she will take what she needs if it'd after food, personally I'm not too sure on this.
I think she's teething from the amount of drool coming out of her mouth and she's been a bit grizzly, just trying to keep getting breast milk and formula into her.

Thanks everyone for the encouragement xx",
"My first pregnancies labour ended up in an emergency c-section and was quite traumatic. I ended up with really bad Ppd and Ppa that I left untreated for too long. I ended up getting help once the suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts became too much. It’s 3 years later and I’m medicated and see a psych regularly and I’m doing and feeling much better. 

I’m wondering who has had a similar experience and what your second pregnancy and postpartum was like? I’m terrified that I’ll end up back in that place but I don’t want fear to stop me from expanding my family. I’d love to hear experiences from anyone who’s been through something similar. ",
Hey moms I want to vent I hope you guys don’t mind. I love motherhood I have always wanted to have two kids it’s been my dream since always. Well I’ve been struggling with ppd/ppa & other struggles but I never thought it would be this hard I’ve always had anxiety & depression as an adolescent but it was different then my symptoms now. For a minute I was so proud I made it to 4 months of postpartum without signs of ppa/ppd. Soon afterwards I had my first intrusive thought & it was distressing truly & from there I spiraled into a million different scenarios that cause me panic. I have processed most by doing CBT & I know they will never happen. I still can’t seem to get passed the guilt & my mind tries to villainize everything I do even towards my family members & my morals. I believe it’s my brains way of trying to tear me down trying to have me feel like a piece of crap. I have dedicated myself to God & he’s the only way I’m getting through all this & being hopeful of healing. I still want to have a second child some day in the future but I never want to feel this way again. I don’t want mental illness taking my dream away! I refuse to let it I will fight & do everything possible! I’m hoping my doctor puts me on the right medicine Monday. I am looking forward to hearing your stories about postpartum & give a girl some hope this gets better? Tips advice anything,
"My wife is really struggling. She’s having some suicidal thoughts and I’ve never seen her like this. She says she would never act on them, but this scares me and her. We keep hoping it’s going to get better but it seems to only be getting worse. She’s currently on Zoloft but tapering off because it’s had a pretty negative effect on her. 

She seen a psychiatrist and mental health experts. And we’re seeking the appropriate help for her current mindset. However, I’m wondering what I can do as her husband to help her? 

I’ve never experienced anything like this before and it seems words and encouragement, and even acts of kindness aren’t getting the job done. Wondering what’s helped others? ",

"I have a history of mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bipolar, and pretty sure undiagnosed issues as well) and having my baby has made it so hard to cope. I feel like so many days are just me fighting for my life. 

So back in February 2023 I got out of a longterm 4 year relationship (that's longterm for me atleast) and a few weeks after the breakup I started talking to who is now my current bf (we did used to talk back in like 2017, so he wasnt a complete stranger). My last relationship wasn't healthy on both sides and me and my ex really hurt each other so I don't think I ever gave myself anytime to actually heal, just jumped into the next relationship. My bf and I started dating March 2023 and actually got pregnant that same month.  So as you can imagine everything's moving pretty fast. Well I also lost my job of 3 years, got evicted, been playing catchup with carpayments, lost another job and just keep on getting slapped in the face with lots of struggles. 

I could feel the depression, anxiety, and rage creeping in during pregnancy but tried my best to ignore it. I did pretty well keeping a smile on the outside while I was going through a lot in my mind and physically. 

Fast forward beginning of this year I gave birth to my beautiful sweet baby. My daughter had horrible colic up until around 4.5 or 5 months. It was the worse, no matter what i did she just would keep crying and crying. Sleep deprivation plus and crying baby does not mix well for an already mentally ill person. My bf was working a lot around the time (working during  holidays in retail he was pretty drained). So when I gave birth he tried his best to be present but he was so tired it didn't feel like he was as present as he could be, or maybe he was and I just needed extra help. Not even a full 2 months into being postpartum bfs mom and I had an argument and currently 7 months and counting later his whole side of the family still won't talk to us. I have a very small family so I only have my mom and dad (they're separated so it's either one or the other). 

About 3 months pp I went back to work and have been struggling to make it on time, I'm late every single day. I call in. I bs everytime I'm there. I get overwhelmed so incredibly easy. Thankfully I'm part-time and only work about 5 hour shifts a few days a week, but they're killing me. It doesn't help that I had to go to early mornings shifts. Waking up for for at 5-6am when I go to sleep at 12-2am nearly everynight is not for the weak. 

We even have lots of financial issues going on, we had our electricity turned off 2 different times this year. 

I don't mean to get into full detail about everything but I just needed you guys to understand the amount of stress's and change is just getting to me. My life has completely changed since last year and I have no idea who I am. I can't work on any hobbies of mine bc they require me to be focused and it's hard to do that with a 9 month. I'm constantly fearing of losing my job bc I can't get my shit together. I can't never keep the house in order and it's always either messy or needing something to do. I don't even do makeup anymore and I used to do it daily. I don't do anything for myself and I'm having a hard time doing things for my family. I feel so lost. 

I love my baby so much but I never imagined having a baby honestly, especially this early in life. I feel so stupid for how things turned out. I try my best to be patient but sometimes I have the worse breakdowns. Lastnight I couldn't stop crying and screaming bc I just wanted to make some food and my daughter was tired but fighting her sleep really hard. It was so tough and I was all on my own. (Bf works until like 11pm-12:30am so I'm literally all alone). 

Some days are so easy to control my emotions. I really do feel like the best mom ever and I'm so proud of myself but lately ive been in a slump and I get easily triggered by my bf, baby, cats, work, literally anything and everything. I kind of have friends but if I'm honestly speaking they're just old high-school/old work friends. I never really used to hang with them much outside of those places. My past relationship kept me from being to close to anyone so I pushed my many ppl out of my life. I don't have anyone that close to me. Sure I have some people that I know if I reached out to they could be there for me and actually understand what I'm going through but I just feel disconnected from everyone. 

I'm not sure the point of me writing this, it's just been a lot and I want to feel heard and seen. I'm sure it'll get better eventually but I don't know how much more stress I can take. I feel like a horrible mom a lot of the time. it's just ne and my bf for the most part, occasionally I have my mom's help but she's getting older and has health problems so she can't always help out as much as she's like to. 

 Disclaimer: my bf treats me really well and he always tries his best to help me feel better and take over when he's home, but I know deep down he's struggling too. Especially since his whole family are basically disowning him atp. 

Another disclaimer: I breastfeed and it takes every single ounce of everything from me. somedays I feel like I have no type of nutrients or vitamins and my minds just not fully here. ",
"Anyone else ever feel like they just don’t want to be here anymore.. that they just don’t wanna do
It anymore but also know that no one will take care of your babies like you would? No one would know their routines or favorite foods.. or what soothes them.. what makes them happy.. no one would just know them like you know them. I know the dark feelings will pass I just gotta ride it out. ",
"
I am 7 weeks postpartum and literally feel like I’m drowning. I can’t do this anymore. I have postpartum anxiety and depression and was put on medication for it over a month ago. I thought it would get better. It’s not. 

In the beginning my husband was really helpful and supportive but lately has been treating his leave like a vacation. I’m starting to resent him for it. While he’s going out to dinner, etc with friends, going fishing/hiking, and gaming for most of the day, I’m literally living in the same 3 hour cycle. I’m doing the majority of the feedings- day and night (my baby is formula fed, not breastfed), bathing him, doing tummy time and all the interaction activities and when I’m not doing that and he is watching our baby, I am doing laundry, cleaning, cleaning/making bottles, going to the grocery store or doctors appointments. 
When he has asked me what’s wrong, I have told him time and time again that I’m drowning, I’m struggling, I’m overwhelmed. He says we are in this together and that I’m doing a great job and I’m a great mom. But we definitely are not in this together. We had to be induced 3 weeks early because of preeclampsia and hypertension, I couldn’t breastfeed, my body is going through hell and my liver is now showing signs of damage. I’m killing myself just to keep up. 
Things really boiled over when I did 2 nights of being up all day/night with the baby back to back and then I didn’t wake up to him crying on the 3rd night, my husband did. My husband gave me shit the next morning about him having to wake up TWICE to feed him and I lost it. I completely shut down. He asked me what’s wrong and I kept saying nothing so I wouldn’t snap on him. Then he got pissed at me for not telling him what’s wrong. We haven’t spoken in over a week aside from communicating about the baby. 

He has always been an incredibly loving and supportive partner, especially during my pregnancy. Now it feels like I’m barely getting through the day and he couldn’t care less. He just wants me to come to him and make it better/resolve it and talk to him but I don’t see the point in repeating the same thing over and over. Now…He has no empathy for me or the fact that I’m barely keeping it together. He won’t respond to me or offer any comfort. Nothing. 

I love my son so much. So much. I don’t regret him at all, he is the best baby. But every single day I wake up, I’m disappointed that I did. I lost my life and I just can’t do this anymore. ",
"Hi everyone I’m 3 months postpartum with my first child. I had a really tough pregnancy due to our baby being anemic leading to an emergency c section at 34 weeks. Throughout that time my husband and I had to make a lot of tough decisions that really put a damper on our relationship. 
I feel like I lost trust for him because anytime I needed him to be my support he really let me down. He really makes me feel like a terrible mother sometimes. 
I don’t know what to do because taking isn’t really working anymore and I feel so bad because every little thing he does makes me so angry.

"I've been experiencing a lot of depression lately. I'm 6 weeks postpartum and have a 3 year old. I'm a stay at home mom. I feel so overwhelmed lately, I can hardly put the baby down without him screaming. My house has gone from always being tidy to being a disaster, clothes piled on the floor, dishes piled in the sink, and toys everywhere. My husband works late every night and when he comes home he doesn't want to hold the baby so I can get any chores done. I can't tell him about how I feel. Everytime I've tried to talk about depression to him he pulls away which makes it worse. Or he'll lecture me about how I need to do more and not be so weak or lazy. Lately I've been regretting ever meeting him. I feel like my mind isn't thinking straight. Sometimes I think he works late just to stay away from me and the baby.

I feel like everything has gone downhill so fast. A lot of the time when husband's comes home I'll just pretend like everything is fine and smile and put on a fake happy face. Seems like that's the only way our relationship will last. I've given up trying to share my true feelings with him.

I just want someone to hear me. Not try to fix anything. Just to be heard and recognized would be enough.

I am '28/F' and baby daddy is '32/M'
4 years in relationship, cohabiting
Help! | reckon I am going crazy. I just gave birth three months ago and am currently staying in my family's house in the province. My baby daddy is in Metro Manila because his job needs him to be there.
He would visit us but a very times only once a month or sometimes, not at all. Recently, he was getting pissed at me for being needy and asking him to give me the love that I deserve. A month ago, I caught him through a screenshot that he had sex with a lawyer. I am very depressed and am going crazy. It hurts so bad and I feel so low : ( I feel like I am not worthy and am not a woman of value. To add, there's a lot more in his DMs, and this ain't the first time he cheated on me. Just hurt that he did it again when I just gave birth.",
"Not sure if I'm just venting or seeking advice but hoping I'll feel better even if this just goes into the void. 

I had my son 3 months ago and it's been difficult from the start. I still only get 1 - 3 hours of sleep a night and because of my living situation I can't seem to get more than that. It started with me randomly having emotional breakdowns and crying hysterically. I now recognize that I have intrusive thoughts as well.. things will be fine (or not) and I randomly think of harmful things to myself or child and it scares the shit out of me. I don't feel like myself, I don't know what happened.to me. Lately I feel like things around me are not real, I describe it as I'm feeling 'delusional'.. I feel like I'm losing it. Some days I am great then suddenly I'm not. I don't feel tired, my thoughts are racing making me extremely scattered and making mistakes. I feel like my brain is on fire and I can't stop. It's almost like my eyes are blurry because I can't focus to read but I don't think it's my eyes I think it's my mind. Typing this right now I'm having a hard time rereading what I've written. 

The last few days I swear I keep seeing things. I'm not sure though. I swear I see things out of the corner of my eye and I'll recheck a million times because it's so vivid but it's not actually there. My mind is zoning out and I feel detached. I'm scared to be alone with my baby. I feel so guilty because I know for a fact that I love my baby but I don't feel it. I feel detached from him and I hate being a parent. I think he would be better without me because I'm going to ruin his life. He deserves someone who feels immense love. I can't handle him and I need constant help. I told my.bpufriend he should take our son and leave me but he won't. 

I don't know if all this stuff is real or of I am just tired or just overthinking but it scares me. I don't know what to do. Ive been on Prozac for 10+ years and upped them a month after having baby but this doesn't feel like the anxiety and depression/mania I know from the past. 

Is this normal? Does anyone else have similar experiences? ",
"I, 23f, gave birth to my daughter almost 6 weeks ago now. Prior to pregnancy I was diagnosed with BPD(borderline personality disorder) and have been trying to manage that for years. It made me high risk for PPD which I have now been diagnosed with and it's not a good combination. Just for some clarification first.

Things have gotten really hard for me, especially the last few weeks. My fiance doesn't help with our daughter or with cleaning when he's home from work. He doesn't get up through the night, change her, hold her, feed her, ect. She's solely my responsibility and the house has been too(He leaves dishes, clothes, garbage everywhere) and it's made me extremely frustrated. The frustration mixed with the exhaustion and mental drain has made me very easy to lash out. I'm scared I'm going to hurt my daughter. There's been moments where she won't stop crying no matter what I do and I've been a little too rough with her, or yelling at her. I've genuinely been thinking about putting her up for adoption because I'm so scared I'll lash out at her and seriously hurt her. I know my fiance won't want to but I don't feel like I can safely do this anymore. If I had more help from him with her at the very least then maybe I could because I could sleep more and have a few moments to myself but thats not the case. He feels that he brings in the money and drives when we run errands that he doesn't need to do more. I love my daughter so much and I want what's best for her... and I feel like I'm not what's best for her. I'm so lost..

"My now ex fiancé (36M) and I (38F) are currently living together but we are no longer a couple. We were together for almost 5 years. It's a long story but mainly we had a very toxic relationship, mostly on my part but whenever I would not cause drama, he would. I am diagnosed with post partum depression and he is diagnosed with anxiety disorder and ADHD we are both on medication. He broke up with me due to my mental health issues and I live in his house. I am unable to move out due to the high cost of living in our state and we agreed I would move out after January so I could be stable and not financially dependent of him. We have a little baby and two other girls. After breaking up I begged for reconsideration but he was set on his decision. Then I went out with a guy and had sex with him and he found out. Now everything feels terrible, he is hurt and I wish  I could go back in time and not gone out that night. Our living situation is exhausting, he goes from loving me, to anger, to hating me all in one day. He keeps saying he will not get back together with me but looks for me for sex and he checks my phone and socials constantly. 
How can I make things peaceful since I cannot leave anytime soon?
 Is he ever going to change his mind?
Has anyone experienced this before?",
"our baby boy was born 2 days ago and since last night i haven’t been able to bare my partner. his presence is annoying me and it’s so frustrating. 

i feel like at times he really tries to take over with the baby and the first thing that made me angry was him getting mad at me for holding my son, complaining that if he falls asleep on me he’ll wake up as soon as he gets passed back to my partner to go in the cot (i couldn’t walk at this time). i let it be because i had an understanding and we honestly did both just want to sleep, he was also very very helpful on the first night. 

the second night however, he got mad at the baby, slept basically the whole night from 12am until 1pm and i had to do so much by myself (feeding, changing, maintaining a clean space, putting baby to sleep etc.. im still in so much pain and running on a couple of hours sleep. 

thankfully, i live with my mum so she was a great help and i can actually shower but seriously why do i not feel much towards my partner right now and what can i do about it, its making me so sad. ",
"My wife believes she’s suffering from PPD. Is there anything I can help her with until she sees her dr? She’s also bipolar 1 which can add to everything she is going through. She just came off of a manic episode and is now in a depressive state. She feels like PPD is making her depression worse. I’ve been taking care of our 3 kids for about 3 months now on my own due to her hospital stays ( not complaining or looking for a pat on the back. I just feel it’s what a husband and father should be doing) I was wondering if there was anything else I can do to support her until she sees her dr. Ive been verbally and emotionally supportive but I feel like there’s more I can do for her.

"Hey all. Suffering with PPD after my second son. He is almost 7mo. I started Lexapro and it has literally been a huge game changer. My life is also extremely stressful right now now for a variety of reasons which I believe contributed to my developing PPD. All this to say, I really want to stop my meds eventually. I am so afraid to rely on them for the rest of my life to be happy. Even though I am so thankful they have helped me. Anybody have some success stories of coming off meds after PPD? How long after baby did you start/stop? How are you doing now? Thanks so much. ",
"Too burned out, no sleep for two days straigjt, not even 30 min rest. 
My baby is sick, im having constant fever(39-40C), as the baby is sick, I have to wake up the whole night to sooth the baby. 
My expectation on my husband went so high, a simple ignorance burnt me like hell
Due to sleep depriveness my eyes are red. Inlook so sick even my husband jockingly said its a turn off

I went mad at a point
And I dont even recall what i did in that 10 mins
My mom held me, put me calm down.

I was out of mind, I was just Holding the baby firmly, only thats what I can remember. 

After coming back from moms home, husband was a bit annoyed idk why, it made me so sad, I couldnt hold my tear anymore, things started to glitched up, Really glitched, I cried so hard that baby started to cry.

I’m currently 5 months pp. Am starting to think I may have PPD… and it also feels like my body is actually revolting against me anytime I’m around my in laws. Before I got pregnant I used to have really bad neck pain. At least once a month I’d wake up and couldn’t fully look left or right. It was awful. Pregnancy I lived in another state and boom. No neck pain all pregnancy. We end up moving near my in-laws and the neck pain is BACK IN FULL FORCE but wait.. it gets weird. It only happens when I am around them � and it doesn’t go away for at least two days afterwards. For reference I don’t have a great relationship with the MIL (who Freud would love btw) and my SILs are tolerable but make me feel like I’m simply not wanted around. It’s weird. My whole life I’ve gotten along so easily with everyone and then I join a family and they seem to pick me apart like I’m a pos. It sucks. Anyways is this a coincidence or is my body like gtfo girl your mental health is going to the shitter if you stay here �‍�,
"Hey there-

So I believe I had post partum depression when my first was born 11 weeks ago. It lasted until 6 weeks. Then I suddenly seemed to snap out of it after spending time with a friend of mine who always seems to put things in perspective for me. 

From 6 weeks up until 2 days ago I felt good. I was in a routine with my baby. Felt I had a handle on things and was chuggin along not feeling depressed. And then last week I came down with a cold. For the first few days it was fine and I was dealing okay. I even went out with the baby to target and carried on like all was well.  When I woke up the next morning I felt so sick. I am not a person who gets sick often so I feel that I get extra frustrated when I do. 

I swear that morning I didn’t know how I was going to possibly take care of the baby by myself. Luckily my husband was able to stay home from work and help. Although I still ended up doing half the child care. 

The following day I miraculously felt better and we went out and had a fun weekend with friends. The baby even slept through the night for the first time. When I woke up Monday morning to start my day I felt right back to where I was before 6 weeks. Depressed and overwhelmed by the thought of the never ending responsibility of motherhood.   How I will never have time to myself again. How there is no me anymore.  

I think being sick is what brought back up these feelings. Similar to how I felt when I got home from the hospital after giving birth… like I needed time to recover but couldn’t bc I am a mom now. 

Something about being sick and feeling like I have to take care of baby even when I care barely take care of myself really gets to me and sends me spiraling. 

I question if this is even post partum depression or just the reality of my life setting in ?

As I rocked my baby to sleep tonight I started crying hysterical thinking about how ungrateful I felt to be the mom of such a beautiful baby. ",
"My MIL treated me like shit after I had my 1st baby, this without a doubt contributed to my PPA and PPD. In the first few weeks postpartum she said things like “I hope you like your new stretch marks” (which I did not get - jokes on her) and “nobody gives a shit about you guys now that the baby’s born” etc etc. She makes these horrible nasty comments and then I think she realizes how awful she sounds because shortly after she buys us a pack of diapers or does something nice. Every time my husband says something to her about it she’s miss positive for a while and then slips back into her old ways. 

I am now pregnant with baby #2 and am being much more selective about who is around me & baby postpartum in attempt to minimize PPD. I’m trying to figure out if I should cut her off completely or continue to try and tolerate her so my kids have a relationship with their grandparents. I would appreciate any advice you guys might have ",
"Hello, 
My wife is pregnant with twins and is now entering her third trimester. We are both very excited but also know we face challenges ahead when the babies are born. My wife is at a higher risk of postpartum depression, and I know she is a stressed about how it may impact her. Any feedback about what I can do to help her during that time would be very helpful, as I want to make her as comfortable as possible and be there for her the best I can. This is her first pregnancy and I’m about to be a new Dad, so this is all very new for me. ",
"It is red, inflamed. I thought was a zit or an ingrown hair but I'm not positive 

It's sensitive to touch and a little squishy and hard not sure. 

I also am dealing with PFD and all those issues with pelvic floor and I've never cried more in my life. 

I want more kids but is it even worth it�

"I have been experiencing postpartum depression for 2 months. I have nothing but good things to say about the health system in terms of my care (social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist). I do everything to help myself. On the other hand, despite all the setup I have the impression that I will never get out of it. I have no interest in my baby, the time is terribly long and my anxiety is beyond overwhelming. I also have to change my medication which is helping me a little, so I'm afraid of getting worse again by the time the new medication takes effect. (im scared of the Side Effects of m'y actual médication).
I can't take it anymore and I often think about doing the irreparable. I can't take it anymore.",
For anyone who’s experienced postpartum for 1-1.5 years after their first baby in the form of not feeling like themself and not enjoying things. Does this happen as badly or as long the second time around?,
"I just feel so sad. I feel like a bad mom 24/7. I seriously sit here at night and think about the day and feel like the worst mom on earth for not giving my baby the attention i feel he deserves. As i sit here and feed him he looks so cute and perfect and i hate myself because he deserves the best mom in the world and thats not me. Im the world’s shittiest mom. I don’t know how to be better or find the motivation to be like those put together moms. Is this PPD speaking or am i just really this bad :(

"I had my precious baby on 9/17 and got home yesterday. It was a smooth and fast delivery. I had an amazing experience. But I wanted to go home immediately after birth and was so miserable in the postpartum unit. I got maybe 2-3 hours of sleep while there bc the nurses kept coming in and bugging both baby and I. I am so happy to be home but now I am having so much anxiety and paranoia. I also developed heart palpitations because of it and it’s so uncomfortable. Anytime I’m not holding the baby or need to do anything besides hold baby, the heart palpitations start. what are ways I can cope with this? This is my 2nd baby and I got ppd after my 1st and they told me it may hit harder this time around so I’m being seen in two weeks instead of waiting the 6 weeks but im driving myself crazy worrying about my baby.  Now that im home we are sleeping better and my fiance is doing everything he possibly can to be helpful. It’s just my own head that I’m struggling with � also, why are night times so hard emotionally/mentally? I don’t mind getting up for my baby but as the sun goes down I get really depressed and anxious and that’s when my heart starts having palpitations. I feel so alone even tho my fiance is helping me in every way he can. I hate feeling like this. I feel so depressed about the future and the past. I just want to feel normal again. ",
"Is it post partum when you literally don’t want to be away from your baby and in the same respect want to be away from the baby for just a little bit but can’t because your baby won’t let anyone else hold him? 

I’m 9 weeks pp right now and trying not to go back to work next week and I just keep feeling like the world is going to end if I have to bring him to daycare. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and hoping she will help me get short term disability extension but in the mean time I’m panicked and feel this overwhelming feeling of dread and anger.

I had my aunts over ( my mom died when I was young I have no other support) to help me with my 3 year old while my husband is working and they even tried to hold him and he wouldn’t let them hold him for more than 5 minutes. I can’t even imagine leaving him at daycare where they have 10+ other kids to take care of while mine is just screaming for me. I can’t even fathom that, I need more time with him, he needs more time with me. 

They (my aunts) just laughed and wrote it off that he just loves me so much. All I wanted to do was cry.  I got so angry that they didn’t try a little harder and I got mad at myself for getting annoyed with my baby. 

The fact that people say that it’s hard and that everyone feels this way, yea I get it a lot of people feel this way but do they really?? How invalidating to tell someone who literally feels like the world will end next week if I have to bring him to daycare.

We can’t afford for me to stay home without getting paid, I can’t put my family in danger like that but at the same time I literally dread the feelings that will inevitably come.

With my daughter we had to bring her to daycare at 6 weeks and I cried and cried for weeks while I worked. I felt so guilty and upset and alone. Now I feel even worse going into it and I can’t even imagine how i will feel away from him.

I’m exhausted, I’m annoyed, I’m scared. I’m angry. Ugh.

"I need some help navigating an issue with my SIL.  I’ve been talking about to my therapist who is a male but it would be nice to have parent and/or women POV
 
Context: 
I have a 20 month old son that was planned with a surprise baby girl coming on the way in 6 weeks. I have fertility issues and she is our little miracle that came unexpectedly. My husband has an intense connection to his family, for most
Of our 5 year marriage someone from his family (mom, nephews, uncle and sister) has lived with us ranging from 3 to 9 month stints and they typically come with some form illness or caretaking that he has to provide. In therapy I’ve recently shared I just don’t want this for myself and I want to enjoy my little family moving forward we need to come to a better agreement. I’m okay with short visits but not having people constantly living with us like a revolving door, especially because he has 7 other siblings that don’t have small kids that can share responsibility. His sister has been living with us since feb 2024 and we aligned she’d the last
One until she can move into her own home hopefully soon. 

Problem
Fast forward to today. My sister in law has been here for 7 months from another country and she just does not wash her hands. She uses hand sanitizer because I strongly push for it all the time but things like when she touches the trash bin outside and comes in or wants to start washing dishes, I’ll ask her and she thinks washing her hands without soap is an ok solution. There is a cultural difference and language barrier but I feel like I’m
Tired of having this convo. My husband is zero help tbh, we had this issue with his mom who was here during my post portum journey last year who has highly unhygienic and it just drove a wedge between us because he felt I was always bringing it up

My sister in law is not like my MIL, she’s highly helpful with our son, and know she’”ll be a help with our daughter comes soon with keeping him busy but her not washing her hands with soap is giving me the worst anxiety ever and I’m Not sure if I should be pushing for her to move out or if I should be handling this another way. Ive already set a boundary that I or my husband would be the only one sterilizing the bottles and pump parts so that’s good. But I had terrible PPA with my mother in law last year staying here and was not feeling safe in my home and while I know it would never be intense like that with my SIL. I’m just getting nervous especially because she cooks a lot and naturally ends up around things 

Would love any advice ",

I have been struggling with my body image since I had my son. I had an emergency c section and it healed well.. very grateful for that but it feels like my fat sits different and looks uneven.

"Hi all, 

I started feeling not myself when my LO was about 5 months (I think, memory is a bit hazy)... 
Took me a month or 2 to look for help. Then another 3 or 4 to get off waiting lists and get help. 
My symptoms got worse as I waited. I didn't think it was PPD as I wasn't sad or experiencing psychosis. 
I was having some out of body experiences, I could sleep 16 hours a day easily and still be tired, incredible brain fog and short term/long term memory issues and a general apathy for all things in relationship, life, my child or even my own parents. 

Started SSRIs, was given a diagnosis and the apathy started to lessen and I had validation and hope which felt great. 
Started feeling a little better... bit by bit... a couple of set backs and my dose increased bit by bit. 

I got pregnant again which I was delighted about. Dose increased again a little while later. Now to 175mg... max dose 200mg. 

My biggest issue now is dissociation. I find it so hard to feel anything. My therapist reckons it's a life long struggle of growing up learning to supress. I want to be excited about my new LO. I want to experience the joy I know I can with my nearly 2 year old. I want to feel fear and love. 

I suppose I'm wondering if anyone else ever went through something similar? Is it the meds? I am making intellectual brakethroughs by the dozen in therapy- linking my fear of loss ans abandonment ans exclusion, a love so great as having a baby my body shut down all emotions so that I couldn't fear losing it if anything happened. 
If my dose lowers will I be able to feel more? Am I stuck like this forever? Did I ever have feelings? 

Thanks for reading this far!!",
It's that simple. I don't know what to do. She sleeps all the time and has been very very mean. She close fist hits me. ,
I have undiagnosed postpartum rage triggered by being overstimulated and by my husband mostly. I feel like I am like one of those expensive firecracker fountains. The trigger lights the wick and every tiny thing creates a domino effect. My toddler has asked me to stop screaming and they told me that I scared them because I scream. I also do not spend as much time with then due to my work schedule. They do not act excited to see me either but they will greet and run up to my husband and other family members with excitement. I understand that I have probably traumatized my child and I just want them to feel safe around me again. How can I rekindle our relationship? I know it isn't too late. ,
"I have been so anxious about this since my baby was born , i had a really bad experience with my in-laws when i was 6 days postpartum and they were rude and didn't respect my boundaries. Now almost 4 months postpartum, my grandma had a stroke (luckily she has her memory and speech but her face is partially paralyzed) she lives in puerto rico , so i would have to travel there, i feel like everyone expects me to be there with my baby with or without my husband, my mother and step-sister were pressuring me about it, ive never travelled on plane by myself or with my LO and definitely not from CO to PR. Im scared that my boundaries will not be respected and i will snap at one of my family members ( an i wouldn't want to), i obviously want to go see my grandma and be there for her in her time of need but theres so many things i would need to consider, like ticket prices is a big one and i would need to get a portable carseat, the fear of my LO getting something like covid or rsv, long layovers and things like that, i talked to my husband and he said i dont owe anything to anyone, that i should do what is best for our baby not for everyone else, has anyone else had these fears? Am i being to overprotective with my baby? ",
"I’m really sorry if this comes off horrible and this is why I’m on a throwaway because I’m just not trying to be judged. I’m just past 3 months pp and I feel like I’m living in a nightmare that just won’t end. 

My son was born by emergency c section which I feel traumatized me a lot, I did very much want him but was not prepared for this at all. I had my older son about 5 years ago and also dealt with PPD/A but I feel like this is so much worse. 

He is inconsolable 90% of the time unless he’s being held and then when you do hold him, you pay for it after because he screams being put down. I don’t want to wear baby-wear because I get overstimulated by having to be “attached” to him and I’ve tried swings/bouncy balls but he solely just wants to be in someone’s fucking arms 24/7 and screams for at least 20-30mins and sometimes hours. 

We’ve brought him to the paediatrician who ruled out gas/formula issues and claims he’s just a “Velcro baby” and I need to just “remain calm”. I also have the issue of family telling me I need to just give in and hold him, which makes my life harder because of the aftermath. Certain family continue to overhold him against my wishes, also making my life miserable after which is extremely frustrating. 

I feel like this stage is hell everyday and is going by so slowly. I want my life back and feel like I’ve been robbed of my own mental peace and most times feel like I don’t like my baby at all. 

I also lost my father about a month ago and can barely mourn in fucking peace because apparently my baby’s having a harder life than I am and needs to cry consistently. 

My partner is extremely helpful but also works so I try not to ask him to leave too often but, he will whenever I ask. My other son is on the ASD spectrum and is not as difficult to deal with but in finding I’m having less patience with him due to dealing with the other child. 

I just really feel as if this baby has ruined my life and I just don’t see a light at the end because this seems to just be his personality and I’m in fear for what’s to come next. Especially with overbearing and spoiling family members that will probably make the situation worse when he’s older. 

I guess I’m looking for some encouragement, it does feel good to vent but I’m just tired of feeling like this everyday because I know it’s not my true self and a lot of the circumstances are not my fault.

"I'm 6months pp. this past weekend I found out the father of my child had another woman in our apartment - again.

I tried to make it work because, who wants a broken home? Anywho, this past weekend I found out that not only was this girl here but he took her out for her birthday instead of getting our daughter like he has been but disguising it as having to work. I found out and raged - bad! I was already a bit off due to my mom diagnoses and just in general if we're being honest. I have our daughter day in and day out. When I'm happy. When I'm sad. When I'm disassociating. ALL THE TIME! Yes, that's part of being a mom but I NEED A BREAK! But I feel bad particularly today because I just want to drop her off to him and let him figure it out because I'm just so broken BUT I also want him nowhere near her. All I can do is cry and I really thought I was out of the extreme PPD but I feel myself slipping back in and I just feel defeated.

"Hi everyone,

Posting this again :) After giving birth, I realized there was a huge gap in pp support for mothers. I went through an unplanned C-section, birth trauma, and postpartum preeclampsia, and I remember searching for a space where I could connect with other moms in real-time, but I often found forums lacking that immediate, comforting connection.

I decided to create a pp community in Discord to help bridge this gap. I am not trying to sound gimmicky. I am determined to create a safe, informative, supportive community, in real-time for pp mothers. For those unfamiliar w/ Discord, it provides real-time connection, organized spaces, and event hosting (which I plan on doing once it grows - think webinars with specialists in all different postpartum fields), among other cool capabilities. I would be honored if you would join!

"I’m at the fucking ledge today…. But I’m talking myself off it because I don’t want to do that to my daughter. She’s almost three years old and with her birthday getting closer, it’s kinda triggering…. I hate that I feel like I don’t want anything to do with her (she wasn’t planned but we planned it anyway because I felt like I had to keep her regardless of my feelings; she was a surprise baby) I hate that I resent her because of all the trauma I went through when I gave birth and when I was abused by my ex spouse who is also a narcissist. It’s like trauma on top of trauma for six years and it fucking hurts. Trauma therapy helps me so much though but it doesn’t help when my family sometimes brings up the fact that I’m stuck with her regardless. Like, I didn’t realize that I actually had a fucking choice when I got pregnant??? No one told me this shit. He forced me to keep my mouth shut when I had CPS involved because of my PPD three days after I gave birth to my daughter. Now that she’s almost three, I’m really trying to bond and really connect with her but it’s so fucking difficult. I feel like I died when I she was born and I hate it. I still feel that way and I fucking hate it. When I was in the psych hospital, I was finally feeling better but when I was back in the abusive environment that I was put out of, it triggered soooo many self harm urges that still exist now. I’m out of there after six, almost seven years of being with my narc, but I’m struggling to even love myself, much less her….. I want to fucking scream. The distance still feels like it’s still there but I’d rather hold onto her when she’s with me and cling to the sacred amount of time that I spend with her than when she’s with my ex….. I hate that when she’s away from me for too long, it’s almost like she doesn’t exist in the first place and I hate it. What the fuck is wrong with me?? Like, I’m finally going through trauma therapy because of all the hell I went through, but I feel like such a shitty Mom for not wanting anything to do with my daughter some nights……",
"I don’t wanna eat much. Even if I do, I can’t eat much but I will force myself to eat it or there will be no breastmilk. I feel like I’m a pumping machine, pumping all the time. Ideally I should pump 8 times everyday but I only do it 4 times at max and I have NO time! I want to breastfeed my son and let him suck and drink it directly so I don’t have to pump it and wash and sanitize the pumps like crazy…. But I don’t know if it is his torticollis problem or my position is not comfortable for him. It seems that he’s not happy to drink it from my breasts. I don’t know what to do…. But I definitely want to breastmilk him to have a close connection with him.",

"I don’t know how to snap out of it. I’ve got all I’ve ever wanted, a wonderful partner, a great 11 yr old step daughter and the sweetest 15month old son yet I’m the most depressed and unhappy I’ve ever been in my entire life. I wake up so grumpy for no reason at all. Every little thing just makes me want to scream or cry. I should be happy. It’s now effecting my relationship with my partner, he says I’m never happy, never smile “do you even want to be a part of this family?” How do get my happiness back? ",
"Sharing for the mama who feels like she is suffocating under her PPD and PPA. 

I took my first Zoloft yesterday. 

It took me 4.5 years to get here. Here as in, a place where I’ve realized I cannot holistically heal myself from my PPD any longer. 

In 2020 (S/O to the Covid mamas…), I welcomed my first child. An answered prayer. The joy of my life. Everything I ever wanted. 

I almost immediately began to spiral into what I now know was PPD and PPA. 
Every symptom you can imagine, I had/have it. Rage towards my husband, inability to make simple decisions, overwhelming anxiety, sleep deprivation, no joy, panic attacks… the whole enchilada. 

I pushed through. Despite it almost crippling my marriage entirely. 

It is by God’s providential grace my marriage is still in tact, as I almost single handily destroyed it from a place of PPD and PPA. 

I was 9 months PP with my first child when I started to take proactive steps to heal. 
Christian counseling.
Prayer. 
Bible studies.
Daily exercise. 
Adequate sleep. 
Letting my husband and parents help me with childcare so I could go out for a solo errand. 
High quality supplementation. 
Whole food diet. 

I slowly started to heal. Time helped, too. 
I healed, but I was never fully back to normal again. I just lessened the load and learned to live with it. PPD and PPA was my new baseline. 

I now have 3 beautiful children and one angel baby (miscarriage). 

4 pregnancies. 4.5 years. 

I never healed. I just carried PPD and PPA with me this entire time. I silently suffered. Although I never felt feelings of rage or disconnect towards my children, my internal dialogue was like a scene from 300 at all times. I lived in fight or flight. I hated my husband and parents for NO reason. I was not rational. 

I was a/am a high functioning depressed, anxious woman. 

Well, this week I decided I didn’t want to live like this anymore. 
“A wise woman builds her home, but a foolish woman tears it down with her own hands.” - yep, that’s me. 

Paul in Romans 7 when he says his heart and mind want to do what’s right but the flesh can’t listen? Yep, me. 

For the sake of my marriage, my household environment, family culture, and my OWN JOY…. I talked to a professional this week. 

And guess what? From carrying this for so long, I’m on the verge of entering major depression. I also have premenstrual dysphoric disorder and probably have had general anxiety disorder my whole life. 

There is no amount of kale I can eat, supplements I can take, weights I can lift, sleep I can sleep, and sunshine I can bask in that will change my messed up serotonin. 

So, yesterday, I took my first Zoloft. This is not my end. This is my beginning. This is not failure. This is actually bravery, admitting I can’t do it alone. It took me almost five years and it almost cost me everything. I’m not less of a Christian or less of a woman because I’m now prescribed an SSRI. 

I can’t heal when I’m trying to survive. I pray Zoloft will help me learn to thrive again so I can work on me more intentionally and in a less frantic way. Zoloft helps my brain so I can help my heart. That’s what I’m hoping. 

SO - if you’re reading this and you’re afraid to be honest with your doctor because you don’t want to be labeled something or you are fighting help… Pray about it. Be strong. Be courageous. And know you don’t have to hold this all together on your own. 

Much love. ❤️

"I have a 16 month old and a 5 week old. I had bad postpartum rage with my oldest which caused major problems in my relationship with their dad. When I finally got over the hill I became pregnant again 5 months pp. I am now falling down a hole again where I can’t stand my partner, I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to pump (exclusively pumping), I don’t want to get out of bed in the mornings, I don’t want to do anything but scream, cry or just disappear. I don’t want to be here ( not in suicidal way) it’s just too much and I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I feel like the only time I’m happy is when I’m playing with my sons. I’m scared that my partner will get fed up and leave because I can’t get him to understand how I feel. How do I get him to understand he’s not doing anything and to stop thinking I’m attacking him all the time when in reality I am doing everything in my power to not go off the deep end? 
Please someone help me ",
"I’m 8 weeks pp and have developed severe ppd/ppa, to the point of not being able to function most days. This is my second baby, I did not experience this with the birth of my first son.  

After the birth of my second son 8 weeks ago, I was fine for 2 weeks, experienced mild anxiety but I loved my baby more than anything.   Then the ppd set in and I want nothing to do with my baby, don’t feel like I love him, annoyed that I have to take care of him (he is very well taken care of I just have no desire to care for him).  

I can’t stop ruminating over the fact I have lost all my love for my kids and joy of life. I don’t feel connected, but I WANT to feel connected SO BAD!  This in turn ramps up my anxiety.   I have to take Ativan most days to get thru the day.  I started zoloft 25mg 4 weeks ago and just upped it to 50mg yesterday with the help of a psychiatrist.  I started therapy but my therapist did not provide me any coping tools.

Is this normal?? What can I do to try to help cope! Any suggestions help!! ",
"This is something that has bugged me for ALONG time and I am wondering if anyone else has these thoughts of if I just have some weird attachment issues. It is causing a lot of my PPD issues because I am blaming the girls for ""ruining my life"".

Backstory: I met my fiancé when I was 26 and he was 27. Before I met him I was in a relationship with a man twice my age, who was very boring so I did not do typical ""20 year old things"". I worked 2 jobs and then sat around the house when I wasn't working. My now husband on the other hand was very adventurous during that time, had/has a huge friend group who was always together, partied, took trips and just had a lot of fun.

I met my husband and finally had SO much fun. I fit right into the friend group and we were always together and having the best times. I was so happy I finally had found my best friend who I loved doing life with. The man of my dreams. Our relationship moved fast and we got engaged 10 months into our relationship and started wedding planning. We were supposed to be married this past June, however we unexpectedly ended up getting pregnant and had to push the wedding back (was due a week after our set date). We ended up going to the courthouse for insurance reasons and got married and just had our twin girls 2 months ago. He is an amazing father and even better husband, all 3 of us girls are truly blessed. It is a love I have never known and feel so lucky to have him.

That being said...even before our girls were born I really struggled with the fact that I wish I had met him sooner. I feel myself almost get angry and resentful that I did not get that pre-kid, teen, 20's time with him. I got a taste of it for 2 years and it was the best 2 years of my life. I know how much fun life could have been during that younger time with him. Him and his friend group talk about all the ""wild"" times they had together and I just wish I could have been there with him. Then we had the girls and it really felt like the nail in the coffin. Like that I am officially ""old and boring"" and even further proves that I will never have that stage of life with him. Which is silly because we still do SO much (we are blessed with a lot of support for our girls from friends and family) and I have the rest of my life with him. Like we just sat at our friends house last night for a bonfire and drinks with the girls with us and had a fun night. I just for some reason cannot shake the anger, sadness and longing for more of those younger years with him. I find myself crying on almost a daily basis  because I just long for something I will never have and don't know how to accept that. It makes me have awful thoughts about my girls, like this is somehow their fault and makes me not want them. Like stuck in the ""what if""...what would life look like if we didn't have them. Would I be happier? I tourture myself with these thoughts. Maybe this is a co-dependency/attachment issue? Has anyone else felt like this?",
"Idk how to write this. I feel so alone right now. I have a 4 y/o and 2 week old. I am struggling to juggle both. I get 6 weeks mat leave but my husband went back to work this week and it kicked my ass. We are still figuring everything out but I feel so detached from him since we’re both so tired. Baby is currently up from 3am-5/6am and then I have to turn around and get my oldest ready for school. I have the baby by myself until around 6pm when my husband gets home and then I spend that time making dinner and getting my oldest ready for bed. Once the baby goes down at 8/9pm, he sleeps until 11/12 and is awake again at 3am. It’s soooo hard and because my husband gets up at 6am for work, he’s virtually no help over night (which I don’t except from him). I’m overwhelmed and fatigued and I feel so guilty like I’m neglecting my oldest because he’s not the only child anymore. When does this go away? What was your experience? I need support/advice right now",
"I have a friend that I really care about with severe PPD who is su!c!dal with a 1-year-old, and her husband left her this past week ""to work on himself"" and so she's with her parents. She works 2 virtual jobs and lives in a country that has no mental health care or health benefits. Her parents are supportive and doing the best that they can, but have no PPD experience or know-how.   What resources have you found online that I could potentially send to her to try to help her, e.g. helpful books or videos or resources to contact. She is not a US citizen or resident and most of the resources I find online are -1800 numbers or chats limited to the USA.  Any advice?",
I was prescribed it and just any side effects I should be aware of did it work. I also drink sometimes 200mg of caffeine is that gonna effect the meds or cause side effects. ,
Is this a good place to seek help for potential in person options. I don't know where to look for resourses . ,
I have been struggling horribly with PPD and PPA since y second week of giving birth. I have had 2 therapy sessions and they basically tried to downplay my feelings. I told my on and he said he can’t extend my SDI that my psychiatrist has to do it.I tried getting help from my regular primary care and she said to make an apt with psychiatrist. problem is I’m supposed to go to work next week and I don’t think I can’t do it mentally and physically. My apt with psychiatrist is not until after my start date. Do you have any recommendations on what to do in my case. I’m seeking therapy and they will start meds but I do not feel stable enough to go back to work yet.,
"Today was my first actual session with my therapist, and it was so validating. Talking about the lack of support (or also the misguided support) and not feeling like I’m crazy was wonderful. And so eye opening. Saying it out loud did a lot for me too. But the validation �� I absolutely love my therapist. She gave me homework to talk to my husband about the division of labor when it comes to baby, and feeling (and being treated like!) the default parent. While I’m not looking forward to having that talk, it’s beyond necessary. I’ve spent 6 weeks feeling like I was just thrown to the wolves and left to figure it out on my own. It’s also frustrating that things are starting to settle down, baby is getting into a routine, we have breastfeeding down, and I wait until now to finally get the support I not only need but deserve. The newborn trenches are over and I hate that my memory of it is so dark and vulnerable. But hopefully hubs and I can talk and I can feel more like a human being and less like just a cow that’ll get butchered once it can no longer produce milk. You feel me?",
"I (32f), started feeling ppd when baby was 7months old, think it's way easier to stick a postpartum depression diagnostic on exhausted mothers rather than face the real problem : lack of support. As woman, we are expected to mold to our environment much more than men. If we have a hard time fitting into said environment, fault is easily placed on our shoulders and we need to go to therapy, take pills, spend hundreds on self help books to try and find what we can do better. I don't know about y'all but I've been doing all those things all my life plus being clear about what I need from my environment yet it's not enough. I became a mother - I mean, if that's not a good enough reason to expect just a bit more while I adjust, I don't know what is. 

Can I just be like, exhausted of trying to be better, do better and  ask less when my environment washes their hands of wrong doing since a mental health diagnosis was plastered on? 

I don't think postpartum depression as we know it is doing us any favors. I think we are just very tired, feel unsupported and feel alone. For me, ppd right now feels invalidating to my feelings and my exhaustion and a way to make me expect less. 

I think if you start feeling ppd at 7months like I do, maybe you're not the problem. 

Let's take our pills ladies and carry on. ",
"I am 12 months postpartum now and still struggling with PPD symptoms which started 2.5 weeks after I delivered. This has been the worst and darkest year of my life. I don’t wish PPD on anyone! 

I’ve tried therapy and Zoloft which slightly improved my symptoms but never truly healed or cured it or made it better. Got off the Zoloft about two months ago and have since been feeling really bad again. 

How do I get my doctor to prescribe zurzuvae? I brought it up once but they dismissed it saying it was very costly and unless I was willing to pay out of pocket, it would be hard to get. I have great insurance though and would like to try. 

Also, would they prescribe it even though I’m 12 months postpartum? Are my symptoms now considered just depression? 

Feeling so hopeless and low. I’ve been having bad thoughts. I don’t want to try Zoloft bc I don’t think it will help me. I’m so desperate. 

Please, I need help. ",

"My son is 4 months old. He started smiling some time ago and ever since there's one thing that bothers me. He smiles more at other people. Some days it looks like he does not smile at me at all. I spend most of the day and night with him as I am a shm. Everytime someone new enters the room (his father, grandma, aunt or even strangers in stores) his little face brightens with most precious smile. But it takes great effort to make him smile at me. I'm trying to not think about it too much and I'm trying to convince myself it's because he smiles at ""new things"". But there are days (like today) when I can't help but think that he does not really like me and I suck at being a mother. 

Did anyone notice similar thing? Or am I overthinking this?",
"To preface, I never intended to be a parent, I have struggled with mental health my entire life constantly in flight or flight. My husband and I have grown apart in vast measures that I didn't even realize until my one year postpartum mark. I do love my daughter deeply, I believe I can be there for her in ways I didn't know I was capable of because of my love for her. And I surprise myself daily with how well I do and how well she's growing. 

However, I'm struggling immensely with my mental health and the state of my marriage is obviously not helping at all. I feel like I'm pulling the weight of everything and my husband constantly forgets how fragile I am with my mental health. I won't go in to detail but I am constantly advocating for myself and the space for my feelings, I am always making the sacrifices and putting literally everyones well being before my own and always getting the shit end of the stick in every conversation I initiate to find solutions. It honestly feels like my husband is offended and resentful to me that I am not in love with motherhood and not making sacrifices with a big smile on my face (even though I told him before we got married I didn't want to be a parent- our pregnancy was not planned). I desperately wish for the day I can wake up and feel happiness and peace and feel rested enough without riddling myself with guilt to enjoy my daughter. 

I know I am in a bad spiral, I know that this is a rut, but I don't know how to keep myself in a neutral headspace to prevent these horrific spirals where I feel so utterly numb I don't have the energy to feel hopeful. I feel like I'm running frantically, only to be stuck in the same place. I want to enjoy life, I want to rediscover myself, fall in love with this new identity of mine and happily be present watching my daughter grow. But I am pulling and giving from an empty cup, I literally don't remember the last time I felt any sort of relief. I feel like something is wrong with me because I still feel this way despite being one year postpartum. 

My husband and I agreed to have our daughter start daycare so that we could have more time to work on our relationship and ourselves individually to be at a healthy place with ourselves and in turn be better to each other and our family. But I feel immensely guilty about it, it feels like I am placing her care with other people so that I can have some alone time.... I feel like she'll hate me if I don't spend every second with her and I already feel like a failure of a mother because I am not enjoying motherhood as society perpetuates I should be at this point. 

This is the most honest I have been in a long time. Please leave any suggestions or comments that it does get better (or worse) from your experience and anything that I should try to implement to make my life feel less like I am auto piloting everything. Also, I apologize if this didn't make sense, I am all over the place with how overwhelmed I am feeling. ",
"That is it, that is the post. I am 10 weeks postpartum with my twin girls and I just do not want to be a mom. I think about all the things motherhood is going to contain and I feel myself start to panic. Potty train, entertain toddlers, never sleep in again, miss my husband. I never wanted kids, I have never liked kids or had the desire to have one. Things happen, I felt like I would regret an abortion more, but now, all I can think about is how I regret this more. This is such a hopeless daunting feeling because this is THE REST OF MY LIFE. I feel like dying is the only way to escape these feelings. Why why why did I have to do this. I want the old me back. ",
"I don’t have any help and it’s starting to weigh on me. My baby is 2 months old. My MIL is always doing something else and I basically have to make an appointment for her to do anything helpful. My husband can’t watch the baby for 30 minutes without freaking out and needing me to take him, and I have no one on my side. I only get away from my baby and can breathe for maybe an hour every couple weeks. I feel like I’m losing myself in motherhood. My husband acts like he does a lot for the baby but he might change two diapers when he gets home. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a SAHM so I knew I’d be doing most of the childcare but he was supposed to help when he got home. Instead he’ll clean the house. I want to clean the house. I don’t want to be strapped to a baby all day and all night. I love my baby but I’m losing patience and it’s not fair to him. I’ve asked for help in so many different ways even just telling my husband “can you take him so I can nap” “how long” “maybe an hour” “too long”…. And he still wants me to feel like having sex at the end of the day. We had a big talk about how being rejected hurts him and that sex is important in a relationship. I agree that it is but so is mutual respect and sharing the mental load of things. 

He handles the mental load of moving money to each account and going to work. I have the mental load of managing a budget, taking care of a child, trying to clean the house, dealing with his mother who refuses to honor boundaries unless given to her in a very specific way or just not at all (which he “hates to ask me to put up with but that’s just how she is”). 

I do the shopping so I have to load my baby up and take him with me cause she’s never around to help. I’m the one who has to find time to do the laundry, the dishes, the counters, the floors, the bathroom, eat, take care of the baby, make bread, get groceries, bathe the child, and that’s just before he gets home. Once he’s home he wants 20 minutes to “decompress” then all he sees is what didn’t get done. 

He won’t always outright say “what did you do today” or “how did you not get anything done”. Sometimes it’ll just a a sigh or a disappointed look at the sink or couch. Like I’m doing my best! Please just say something good.

He’ll do some cleaning and get pretty much everything that I need to do done in like 3 hours (minus shopping and childcare) and then ask why it’s so hard for me to do things like…YOU DIDNT HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY WHILE DOING THAT. 

Not to mention that my baby is a Velcro baby. He HAS to have a contact nap throughout the day or he won’t sleep at night (don’t comment on that. We will have different opinions and quite frankly idc what anyone has to say about it. I’ve tried to fix that but it doesn’t work). 

Yes as of late he’s been sleeping through the night but I don’t. I get horrible nightmares now. Ever since he started only waking up once a night I’ll get nightmares or night terrors whatever you want to call them. 

We’ve had talks about all of this but the night terrors and it doesn’t change. He still feels like he does more just because sometimes he comes home and swaps laundry or washes a load of dishes. But I’m exhausted, covered in spit up, probably have shit on my hands, and haven’t eaten yet. I know I went on a rant and I’m sorry. ",
"I miss my relationship. I miss myself. It feels like everything was thrown away the moment he was born. I’ll never be happy again. My husband’s will never be in love with me again. 

I don’t get basic human rights. I’m like a slave to this little person. I love my baby but I can’t help but wish sometimes that he wasn’t here.",
"Hey all, I’m a new dad to a beautiful baby girl who I am over the moon for. She is my world and I love her dearly. Unfortunately, my wife has been struggling hard with postpartum depression and it is really bad. All through her pregnancy she was excited to be a mother especially to a baby girl. The week we brought our daughter home she flipped. She told me she didn’t want to do this anymore and that she didn’t want her. We both knew it was PPD so we spoke to her doctor and she is now on anti depressants. 

Since being on her antidepressants, nothing has changed. She has verbally stated she wanted to un-alive herself which ended up getting her placed in a medical facility for 7 days. She was released and it didn’t help. 

 Overall, my daughter is 6 weeks old and I have been fighting to be the supportive husband that my wife and daughter both need. We have been leaning on family for support and due to how bad my wife has it we are moving to be closer to family so they can help her while I can go back to work and make money. 

This is already a long post so I did not go in to detail regarding all of my wife’s actions while dealing with her PPD. My question is, are there any fathers who went through this? How long will it last? Are we making the right decision to move closer to family? What can I do to help my wife? (I already take care of our daughter almost entirely alone. Some days my wife is feeling okay and helps but those days don’t last long). 

Also, my wife wants time away from the baby. She believes that will help her get through this. She said she wants a month away without taking care of her. I almost feel she needs that but is it smart to do? It won’t be easy on me and I’ll be leaning on family if that happened but I’m running out of options. I don’t know how to help my wife meet her needs while also making sure I can make money AND care for our daughter. What can I do?",
"I feel so bad. She has colic and was having a tough time and I just set her down and sobbed. I couldn’t do it anymore. She stopped crying while I was crying and I know she likely felt so neglected. I haven’t been sleeping because my anxiety has been so intense. She’s a great sleeper although not at the same times everyday but when she’s asleep I can’t sleep. I just worry and worry. I feel like I have to get chores around the house done and then the day rolls around and I can’t be there for her because I haven’t slept at all. My anxiety is just so bad right now. I’m on medication and I’m going to therapy. It’s just not helping. I can’t eat or sleep. I have no appetite. I could go all day without eating and not notice. My husband luckily took her before I had been crying for too long. But he got mad at me and kept saying “she’s just a baby” and “you’re not enough”. I handle all of the night feedings and diaper changes because I feel like he won’t wake up. And when I try to sleep, he bothers me almost constantly. I know he’s not trying to be unhelpful, but I am so sleep deprived. I only get maybe three hours a day. That sleep is over multiple sessions. I don’t ever get uninterrupted sleep for more than an hour. I must mention that my anxiety is super high because I have PTSD from childhood abuse. I’m terrified of not hearing her when she cries and neglecting her. I don’t ever want to subject her to what I was subjected to. I feel like me sleeping consistently will subject her to potential neglect. I just can’t take care of myself for fear of not being there for her. I’m positively exhausted. 

I know that this is quite disorganized and may not make sense. Apologies. ",
"I hit 7 months postpartum tomorrow, and I think it’s been hitting me more because now everyone is annoying me. I’m getting frustrated with my baby. And I’m having thoughts of wanting to pinch her when she’s gets very fussy. I know that’s not okay whatsoever. I have not done it nor will I. I’m just having thoughts that’s it. When does it get better ",
"PPD sucks. I’m overwhelmed by everything. Even on meds. I feel like my house is disgusting. I’m so embarrassed by it. It makes me hate being home. Everything keeps piling up. The laundry, the dishes, the baby clothes, the toys, the mess. I can’t seem to keep up with it. 

 Im alone. I stay home M-f. Work the the weekends. I’m an exclusive pumper. So I pump every 2 hours around the clock, and I make just enough to feed my daughter. She’s 6m so starting to need to be entertained and it’s getting hard to pump when I’m solo at home. I feel like I can’t get anything done. And my house disgust me. I hate everything. It makes me SO angry that the constant mess doesn’t bother my husband. I can’t even tell you the last time I’ve been able to clean our bathroom. I have no help. The clutter and grossness to me increases by day. I want to mop, I want to open my curtains to let the light in. I want my house to smell like fresh laundry. But in reality I have 4 baskets of clean clothes that need to be folded. 
Dishes that smell on my counter, dirty clothes on my kitchen table. And I’m overwhelmed.
Where is the village that’s supposed to help?
I feel so alone. I feel like I have no one to help me. If I’m not pumping I’m trying to clean, if I have time to. My daughter wants constant attention, and only naps for 45min-hour non contact. I hate that our gross house doesn’t bother my husband. Why he can’t see a mess and just want to clean it. Instead he wants a list of where to start and what to clean.

"Hello! I’m a first time c section mom who’s 7 weeks PP. I’ve been dealing with weird lightheadedness that the doctors chalked down to postpartum hormones. My BP is always around 100/80.

I was put off of anti depressants after that.

Are there any anti depressants that worked for people without making them fat and without causing insomnia?

I also suffer from body dysmorphia so the weight gain is a bad side effect for me.  ",
"hi everyone, I was just wondering if anyone had any experiences/ coping mechanisms with depersonalisation/derealisation after giving birth? I’m now almost 6 months postpartum and I’m so tired of feeling this way, it doesn’t come in episodes it’s just constant and I even have this same mentality in my dreams so I never get a break from it :( I just feel so disconnected from everyone and everything and I feel like I’m constantly confused and I keep questioning everything like why we are here and what is life ect ect, it’s like I can’t get a grip on reality and I feel so so disconnected from the person I used to be. I don’t know how it’s possible but it feels like I’m not even here right now, even though I know I am. I’m still able to function and take care of my daughter but I’m so worried about my mental state and feel like I’m actually losing my mind �I’ve been worried for months that this was postpartum psychosis but I’ve seen a perinatal team and they have reassured me that’s anxiety/ obsessional thoughts ( I’ve been diagnosed with this for a few years now even before I got pregnant but it was well under control) but this just feels so much more than that :( it’s a feeling I’ve never experienced before. I’ve been discharged from the perinatal team which I guess is a good sign and I’m still seeing the community mental health team and have just recently started seeing a psychologist to work on these. But I’m just so sick of feeling like this and I feel like I’ll never feel normal again :( ",
