7,199,So I’m currently 7 months pp and I feel so alone in this new parenting journey. My husband doesn’t help me with the baby. I have to constantly ask him “can you change his diapers” or “can you watch him so I can shower or eat”. We’ve already had a conversation about this. Hes told me that he feels like he doesn’t help me as much as he should. I basically told him that he needs to see what works best for him but he can’t find it if he doesn’t take that first step. Sad to say he still hasn’t changed. Another thing is that my baby is now a Velcro baby. He always wants to be with me so I can’t really have any alone time to myself or I have to eat fast or shower fast. Since I’m a SAHM I’m just at home all day. The longest I stayed in the house was for 6 consecutive days and I only went out to grocery store to buy vegetables for my baby’s purées. I barely talk to my friends or see them since we live an hour away from them now. As well as my family. So I had considered my husband as my only friend that I can talk to at the moment. When he comes home from work I sometimes try to do something to bring entertainment to my life or just spend quality time with him. I asked him if I can show him a movie I really enjoyed cause I want to be able to talk to someone about it. He wasn’t too thrilled but finally agreed after I begged him. Only for him to fall asleep in the first 10 min. I just told him “it’s fine we can watch it another time…you can take your nap you’re tired” and he keeps telling me that he’ll watch it but I said it’s no use if he’s just gonna fall asleep. So he proceeds to do so. He napped for about and hour and a half…and I tended to the baby. Don’t know when he’ll actually watch cause he’s always tired. Another thing I tried to talk to him about was about the drake and Kendrick beef. I finally looked into it and I wanted to show my husband and yes it’s not important but it’s just entertainment. I wanted someone to talk about it with. He wasn’t interested. I got mad telling him I always listen to his story’s even though it’s about the most pathetic thing but I listen and I engage and I ask questions because I want to talk to my husband but he wouldn’t do the same for me. After a while he said sorry…but that’s it…I didn’t say anything. I put the baby to sleep and he gets on his PC to play. I can’t sleep at this point cause I’m so upset and I just give him one worded answers when he goes to sleep. Now I’m here crying at 2am while he and my baby are sound asleep. And once again I’m alone. Tbh the reason I wanted to post this isn’t to get advice. I just needed to rant and someone to read and listen.,,currently month pp feel alone new parenting journey husband not help baby constantly ask change diaper watch shower eat already conversation tell feel like not help much basically tell need see work well can not find not take first step sad say still not change another thing baby velcro baby always want can not really alone time eat fast shower fast since sahm home day long stay house consecutive day go grocery store buy vegetable babys purées barely talk friend see since live hour away well family consider husband friend talk moment come home work sometimes try something bring entertainment life spend quality time ask show movie really enjoy cause want able talk someone not thrilled finally agree beg fall asleep first min tell fine watch another timeyou take nap tired keep tell hell watch say use go to fall asleep proceed nap hour halfand tend baby not know hell actually watch cause always tired another thing try talk drake kendrick beef finally look want show husband yes important entertainment want someone talk not interested get mad tell always listen story even though pathetic thing listen engage ask question want talk husband would not say sorrybut iti not say anything put baby sleep get pc play can not sleep point cause upset give one word answer go sleep cry baby sound asleep alone tbh reason want post not get advice need rant someone read listen,2,0.46823317,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,210,"So i need to get these thoughts off my chest. My baby is now 7 months and I feel I'm slowly coming out of the fog... but looking back i can't help but come to terms with how irresponsible I was while pregnant i flat out sabotaged my career/reputation/ finances last year...

Im self employed, and have always taken pride in my clients care... but while pregnant I did a few major things wrong... the biggest one i never told my clients I was pregnant, for fear of losing business... but in the end I did lose. I messed up on many significant details during transactions that cost my clients money and time. I 100% hate myself for this. 

The other is due to delivering such poor care, i had a BAD year financially like bringing in less than $5000 bad... thank goodness for my husband having a good stable job but this put our family in a HUGE bind because right before I found out I was pregnant I made a pretty large purchase from a person/ company that I had great dealings with before and he trusted me in good faith, I had intentions of it being covered and paid for within a month of receiving.... well a week after that is when I got the news (very unexpected) and shit hit the fan... making it impossible to cover and pay for...i ultimately kind of forgot about it until this past January when a sheriff showed up with judgment papers �� naming myself AND husband...he had zero part in what i did and his job is at risk now that he's roped into this...i again hate myself for all this turmoil and loss of trust from my husband as well as the company i always used and supported... but in my nature to do ANY of the above i don't want to blame the pregnancy but it sure feels like it had a major effect on my overall thinking and performance. 

There's nothing I can do about this besides learn from my mistakes and ask for forgiveness, it's in process of being paid off. I'm not sure what I'm looking for besides getting thoughts out in the open",,"need get thought chest baby month feel slowly come fog look back can not help come term irresponsible pregnant flat sabotage careerreputation finance last year

13,258,"I 24F and my boyfriend’s 25M relationship has been really honestly struggling ever since I found out I was pregnant. Some context: we were only together for a year, living together for 5 months before getting pregnant, it was obviously not planned (but we did nothing to prevent it). When we found out thats where everything started to crumble, he wanted me to have an abortion- I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself and I have the financial means on my own to care for a baby on my own. It took weeks, I even had an appointment set up at planned parenthood to appease him, finally I stood up for myself and told him I am doing this with or without him and completely understand if he wanted to leave, I gave him multiple outs. 

He decided to stay and “learn to accept the baby” but not help with anything, so I spent my entire pregnancy going to appointments alone, planning the nursery, learning everything you need to know to be a parent, etc. Also, while still cooking every day, our home became a mess because I couldn’t keep up with the cleaning. He would also purposely do things to stress me out, he doesn’t like my dog so he’d purposely antagonize him to make him growl/bark/yelp just to get a reaction out of him. I’d scream and yell and tell him he’s stressing me out so bad and I need him to stop, leave the dog alone and he wouldn’t.

Fast forward to now, our son is here and 5 months old and he is the absolute love of our life’s. He is a great dad on paper, he loves our son unconditionally and would do anything for him, but he needs instructions for everything. I work from home so I am home with the baby all day, while working. He comes home at around 6:30ish every day and will greet and hold the baby but won’t do anything else unless I explicitly ask. I cook dinner for us most nights (on the nights I don’t I pick and pay for the takeout) Ex: I have to ask him hey can you change the baby so I can finish making YOUR dinner, can you give him this bottle so I can take a shower, can you put him down for the night, Its exhausting. I feel like I am both a housewife and a project manager assigning tasks for him to do. 

The issues with the dog is still there, he just will not leave the dog alone, he goes out of his way to antagonize him tells me “I can’t wait for him to die” “I hope he chokes and dies” “I hate him”, then when I get angry he tells me that I am being dramatic, it was a joke and that I’m a terrible dog mom and he isn’t trained. 

I’ve told him so many different times, I don’t feel loved by you, I need more etc. He gets angry and will give me the silent treatment every time I voice my issues. It’s gotten to the point I’ve just began keeping it to myself because nothing changes anyways. I feel like I am constantly just victimizing myself, I can’t even see his side to things anymore. 

I don’t know what to do, I love him, I want to be together and for it to be genuine, I cannot stay with him just because of our baby. I’m sick of feeling this way.

TLDR: Since my pregnancy, I’ve felt unsupported. My boyfriend loves our son but only helps when asked, dismisses my feelings, and antagonizes my dog. I feel exhausted, unloved, and unsure how to move forward, even though I want our relationship to work, I’m afraid its too far gone",,"f boyfriend relationship really honestly struggle ever since find pregnant context together year live together month get pregnant obviously plan nothing prevent find everything start crumble want abortion know would not able live financial mean care baby take week even appointment set plan parenthood appease finally stand tell without completely understand want leave give multiple out

18,285,"So, I found out that I had post partum depression/ rage after my mom had a serious conversation with me about it when my son was about 4 months old. Well I talked to my doctor and got on the medication. And I was in it for a while and then I ran out and wasn’t able to get more of the medication but I didn’t think I needed it bc I was feeling fine all of the bad thoughts and everything were gone, and then about 2-3 weeks later it came back and it was worse. So I figured out a way to get a refill of my medicine and it helped for a little bit and then I ran out again. And this happened about two more times, I’d run out and wouldn’t be able to get more and it’d come back worse a couple weeks later. Well this time I haven’t been on the medicine for about 5 months. And I’m still struggling but it’s been enough that I can manage it by myself without medication. But here the last week or two my son (16months) has been teething and he’s been an absolute menace he’s constantly getting into everything, he doesn’t want me to pick him up or touch him but he also doesn’t want me to put him down so it’s nom stop screaming and fighting. And not to mention he’s been constantly hitting and kicking and head butting me. And I try to do the whole “gentle hand s” and rub my face with hus hand but that doesn’t work it pisses him off more, I tried popping him when he hits me and that makes it worse, I’ve tried ignoring it and that does absolutely nothing. Im a single mother, hus dad says he wants to be in his life but puts in no effort to see him or help with him. I am out if a job right now, and even if I wanted to go back to work there’s no one who can watch my son while im at work, and no one who can bring me to work unless I work nights, but if u work nights I won’t be able to sleep at all, my son has a total of maybe one to three hours in naps a day, and I can’t survive off 1-3 hours of sleep a day.

21,301,"7 months postpartum and I think I have PPD, called my doctor so I'll be seeing them next week but I never realized how alone I felt until now.

I've tried to go back to something of my ""normal self"" and I think I'm finally realizing I'm not going to be able to go back to being her.. I love being a mom and I love my baby so much. I just can't believe I have to let go of who I used to be.

Before I found out I was pregnant, my life was going pretty well. I had accomplished quite a lot for my career, and it started taking off. Then I found out I was pregnant. Just when I thought I figured everything out, I found out I gotta take care of someone else. I didn't have an easy pregnancy, with a lot of health complications. Then my birth was traumatic and now I'm left with a husk of my former self.

I'm scared that I'll never find myself again. That I'll just be a mom. My husband doesn't seem to understand that, when I tell him I ""have nothing"". I really mean it. If someone were to ask me what I liked doing, I don't think I could really answer that. 

I'm just wondering when will this feeling go away? Will I ever find myself again? I feel like I don't even have time to think because my baby constantly cries if I don't feed him or I don't put him to bed. My husband tries but he'll cry his head off until I pick him up. I have to constantly pump milk and wake up in the middle of the night to do too. 

The only time I get to go out is groceries or just errands. I never get to have fun. 

It just seems like I'm not allowed to be me anymore...

I don’t want to be around a bunch of happy people. I don’t want to be around my sisters in law. I know they say relationships are supposed to help you with depression, but I don’t feel like we were really close to begin with. So not going to a wedding wouldn’t be a big deal. The wedding’s not about me anyways so I doubt it would that big of a fuss. 
I’m looking at pricing cosmetic dental work for veneers for maybe sometime this summer. I mentioned it to my husband and he said sure, let me know how much and we’ll save some money and get it done. Part of me just wants to tell him don’t bother because I won’t be here. I can’t think about the future in weeks or months and years totally freaks me out. My chest gets tight and I feel like my heart is racing if anyone talks about the future. 
I was with a group of friends and they all were talking about their travels and how they all went to this one spa and how nice it was. But not me. I’m a SAHM and probably will never go because it’s so expensive and it’s a three hour drive. My husband talks about travel and further plans but I know that won’t happen because we have a one year old. We have other kids too, but I will be tied down for an additional 18 years with her. I’m 45. 
I just hate where I am right now and there’s nothing I can do to change it. I saw an ad on a facebook group for a wfh job. I sent an email, did some texts, and an interview. It was all a scam. I opened a bank account with our bank and because of the fraudulent checks I tried to deposit they put my husband’s deposit on hold. So we can’t even use our checking account this week. All because I tried to get a job. I can’t even do that right. And my resumé was pathetic. 

And why should I be asking my husband for cosmetic things when I don’t work and I can’t even survive on my own. I wouldn’t know how to lease a car, make a resume, or apply for an apartment. I have no money of my own and no skills other than taking care of kids. 

I’m only writing this here because I don’t want to tell my husband. He’s heard it all before and I know he is tired of hearing me complain about my life.

23,306,"I have a 10 day old with my husband. I have 3 other children. He adores them. However, our marriage hasn’t always been good, honest, or even full of love. It’s been rough, and a challenge. 

He has a dog who stays in the crate in the garage of our home (renting) 24/7.. minus when the dog goes to its section of the backyard. The dog howls and barks CONSTANTLY. We have gotten 2 complaints, and the HOA is fining us for the next complaint, and will require the dog be removed after. 

I don’t like the dog. I wish he didn’t have the dog. But he won’t get rid of it. I do not deal with the dog because the dog has attacked my other children, and is very aggressive. That’s why it’s no longer inside the home. He will yell at her constantly to shut up, and when he’s not home, all she does is bark and howl. 

I feel alone because he has only ever changed one diaper, and sleeps through our son’s cries. I had a traumatic c-section. One where I severely hemorrhaged for 2 days following and required multiple transfusions. I have been at home by myself all day taking care of the baby, doing laundry, cleaning, taking care of other children. When he gets home from work, I clean up after him, and am up all night with the baby. I haven’t slept more than 2 hours a night since our son has been born. Husband sleeps right through his cries and is not much help at all. 

I just went almost 3 days without eating, and don’t have much money left in my savings. I went to order food so I can eat, and he told me to get him something. Surely I didn’t have to, but I did. Well, half way through me trying to eat, the baby woke up and needed my milk. So, here I am at the table, juggling a BF baby, a toddler stealing my food, and a husband who is now more worried about the dog. 

I ate half my meal. Then I tried putting toddler to sleep while double-checking chores are done. 

He went to bed. I’m at the point where I think I want to leave. I feel alone. I feel so much hate for how my body looks right now. (I was in great shape prior to this pregnancy.) I have no support- no family, no friends. No me time. I hate my husband now, I’m repulsed by him.

25,311,"Hey all. 

I kind of just need to vent a little if that's okay. A lot of people in our life have never really been apart of PPD and this is my first time, but, all that's being said to my wife is 'it's okay' or 'it will get better'. Now, I'm definitely apart of this group, but, hearing my wife cry dozen+ times a day about not being a good mom, or no bond with the baby, or she made a mistake is taking a toll. 

My wife and I struggled so hard to get here. Couldn't conceive naturally and went through IUI and then IVF. One egg and one sperm ended up working and creating our little miracle - Nemo, as we called them through pregnancy. We didn't want to know gender until delivery and when he was born, my wife went through almost 29 hours of labor and needed a C-section because his heartrate was dipping (found out the umbilical cord was around his body like a sash). 

She developed her PPD in hospital, roughly 2 days after my son's birth. It's been about 2 weeks since, and, everyday is the same. I feel awful for my wife because she is so loving and caring and has the ability to be a great mom. But, her PPD is blinding her to this reality. 

And it's hard hearing my wife like this especially when our baby is healthy. We do have a big support system that's helping us through this, but, it's still a lot. We have talked to her OB and they changed her meds and talked about trying to get her on Zurzuvae. She's talked to a therapist and will talk to them more over the coming weeks. 

I'm not sure if I am looking for advice or anything, but, venting is good. 

Thank you for reading if you have",,"hey

26,313,"It’s been a year now and I’m still struggling with depression. I feel like my life isn’t my own anymore and I’m just a slave to my family. I have to do all the things to keep the house running. I still haven’t figured out what will make me happy and just about every day I think about death. I’ve been dreading these days since the fall. So much has happened. I survived Thanksgiving and my husband says cheerfully, “see, we did thanksgiving so you’ll make it through Christmas.” I interpret that as see, everything is fine and you’re worrying about nothing. 
In the beginning of December my 13 yo daughter was admitted to the ER for self harm. She then went to a mental health hospital for about 3 weeks. She came home the first week of January. It was scary and sad and we had family counseling sessions with her therapist. I felt like I could have been in my daughter’s place. They were talking to her about anxiety and what she needs to do to overcome it. What are the steps? What is your plan, etc. Take self care days, journal your feelings… I told my husband I felt like such a hypocrite being there. How am I supposed to help her when I can’t help myself? 
My husband and I have had a few arguments. I don’t do things for him that show him love. He likes to see me naked and physical affection is his way of being loved. We haven’t had sex for over a year now. It was partly do to the last weeks of my pregnancy, post partum, and then my fear of getting pregnant. I had a hysterectomy in the middle of December so no sex from that. I’m uneasy about having sex with him again. It’s a lot of things that go into that. 
I feel like Christmas for me and the kids didn’t go so well. I told him I wasn’t doing Christmas but I still bought candy, stocking stuffers, and a few gifts for the kids. I did the bare minimum and he dropped the ball on stocking stuffers for me, one of the kids, and a few gifts for some of the kids. 
Then my birthday came up and he planned a dinner for me at a restaurant and invited two couples we know from church. One couple I like, the other I didn’t. The husband of the second couple is one of his good friends that recently got married for the third time. He is a nice man and his wife is nice enough, but I didn’t want them at my birthday dinner. I barely know her and have only spoken to her maybe three times. 
And then… everyone at the table had degrees, jobs, travel adventures and I don’t have a degree, a job, or have traveled the world let alone gone to the spa that is an hour outside of town. Everyone had been to that spa but me. My husband tried to gift me a spa gift certificate there but in a really lame way. He said, “I’d like to get you a spa gift certificate for “that place” but I don’t know what you want to do there.” 
He knows I would have to get child care bc I don’t know when he would be working (he’s an airline pilot.) He’s done several things like that- suggested a gift that he wants to get me that needs to be scheduled but then doesn’t do it. 
So my birthday came, and then he went hunting for 5 days with our older sons and a bunch of other guys. He sent pictures of what they were doing and it seemed like a nice mini vacation for him. Meanwhile I am at home with the teen girls, the 10 yo, and the five little people. We were fine and nothing major happened but it wasn’t the greatest. He says he wants to take me to the hunting place during the summer. I’m not counting on it. 
I have since stopped going to my regular therapist bc I don’t feel like I was making much progress. He validated my feelings but really didn’t give me any insights or tools to get better. I’ve been finding things online from instagram and pinterest. My husband arranged for us to talk to our pastor and that was a disaster. He was asking about my family of origin and then asked “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” 
I can’t even see myself in one month! I wish I was dead by then or had a cancer diagnosis. But no, I’ll probably still be a SAHM with a 5 yr old and 10 yr old twins, and a teen. 
Still the mom, still the cook cleaner, and driver and everything else my husband wants me to be so he can go and do his thing of having a career and meeting people. I keep telling him that he needs to find a better wife. One who is smarter, prettier, happier and that wants to be there with him and all these kids. One who is intellectual and wants to play his card games
I know I’m not happy and I know I am depressed and I don’t want to be here. I’m not who he needs. 
We have a wedding to attend in February and I really don’t want to go. But he says I have to go. I don’t want to go bc I don’t want to see his family. And I don’t want to have to plan everyone’s suitcase and such. We have to travel 5 hours away for it and I just don’t want to go. 
This is just a rant. I don’t think anyone can help me. I don’t want any advice bc I’ve heard it all before. I just had to get my feelings out from this weekend.",,"year still struggle depression feel like life not anymore slave family thing keep house run still not figure make happy every day think death dread day since fall much happen survive thanksgiving husband say cheerfully see thanksgive make christmas interpret see everything fine worry nothing

27,317,"I'm extremely fortunate that I have a job that offers multiple shift patterns. Every year you have to apply to the top 3 patterns you want and you aren't guaranteed to get it, but it's still so nice to have the option.

When I returned from maternity leave in October of 2023, I went straight onto a Monday to Friday pattern. I applied to keep the pattern for 2024 and got it. It was nice because you get holidays and weekends off. I never had to worry about missing family events or my older kid's dance competitions.

But as the year went on, I deteriorated. Wake up, drive the kids to daycare, go to work, pick the kids up, dinner, bath, bed. Every day I got MAX 2 hours to myself. Which wasn't even really to myself because then my husband wanted attention and would get annoyed if I just wanted to scroll on my phone and veg out. I had literally zero waking moments 100% to myself to do what I wanted to do. I would get so fucking angry when people at work were like ""happy Friday!"" because I knew that my weekend was just going to be non stop chores and taking care of kids and continuing to get zero time to myself.

I had non stop fantasies about killing myself. I was barely eating or sleeping anymore. By the end of the year, I lost about 20-30lbs and had to tighten my belt to the smallest it could go. I would scare myself driving to and from work because I felt like I was physically holding myself back from crashing my car. 

After battling back and forth with myself, I decided to go back on shift work. I applied for a 4 on, 5 off position. That means two 12 hour days, two 12 hour nights, and then I get 5 days off. It was a hard decision to make because it meant working weekends and holidays and my husband would have to pick up a lot of the slack and I just felt selfish. But we're just under a month into the year, and I already feel like a weight has been lifted.

On my days off, I have enough time to get the chores done without kids hanging off of me and still plenty of time to just relax and do my own thing. Today, I was playing with my two year old and I was actually smiling and having fun. Maybe this sounds awful, but it's like working 4 days where I either don't see them at all or barely see them, makes me actually miss them and want to spend time with them. I don't feel burnt out. I don't feel like I want to kill myself. I actually feel happy.",,"extremely fortunate job offer multiple shift pattern every year apply top pattern want not guarantee get still nice option

28,321,"PPD hit me like a train at around 5 months and got worse and worse until I literally feel each day that I’m hanging by a thread. That thread is my son who needs me more than anyone else does and I have to stay here for him, even though I picked out exactly how and where I would die. I can’t give up. It’s been so hard to keep myself together and it’s everything I can do to keep going to work every day and doing the things that I need to do. 

I feel like I’m failing at work and I’m failing at home and at my relationships with everyone including my partner. I feel like my son deserves much better than me but for him I try the hardest. At work I have told my boss how overwhelmed I feel. I lead a team of 14 people and that is an intense amount of direct reports, 3 of which need constant support as they are new in their positions. Yesterday I sent an email to my boss detailing that I need help managing my workload and developing better skills so that I can be better on top of things, I confided in her that I was being treated for PPD. She didn’t respond to my email. 

My bosses, bosses, boss, the leader of the facility that I work in came into my office and sat down and probably gave me most healing and understanding talk that I’d ever had. I don’t really know him, though we’ve worked around each other and I’ve worked indirectly for him for many years. He sat and he told me all about how much his partner struggled post partum, how she had PPD and PPR and how they didn’t take it seriously at first. He told me that everyone around me understands the massive change my body went through and no one thinks that I’m a failure for struggling. He said work should shape around my life and the most important thing was to care for myself. He said he couldn’t tell me how to get through the next 6 months, but that I was doing the right things by seeking treatment. It all meant a lot to me. I was apprehensive about reaching out to my boss because she’s always warned about being careful about optics. Reputation, how you look and how your leaders see you, all that is vitally important in the corporate setting. 

Not sure where I am going with this. Just sharing somewhere because I have so few people I can share with. This thing is so isolating, I feel paralyzed to reach out to anyone. It makes you believe that no one cares and everyone is frustrated when you aren’t yourself and maybe can’t do as much for them. But I think more people care than I know and they’d want to help if I just had the courage to reach out.

29,332,"Last week was one of the worst mental health weeks I’ve had in a long time. I have a 4mo baby and a 5yo, just started working from home, and my baby is going through a sleep regression which I know it making everything worse. I told my husband on Tuesday of last week that it was a rough mental health day and he asked if there was anything he could do. I never know how to answer that when people ask lol. It’s like, no, but yes but I’m not sure what or how? Well anyway, he decided last week he was going to start working out after work and by the time he’s done, it’s dinner time and then bedtime for the girls. So it’s just me handling everything for the kids. I brought it up by the end of the week and he said “I didn’t realize it was that bad. You just handle it really well” and kind of dismissed it. I broke down because what choice do I have?? I told him I’m suffering mentally and life was a lot earlier in the week. I know he’s going through a lot right now with deaths in his family, other family issues, and work, so I didn’t push it any further. 

On top of that, I tried telling my uncle that I’m close with that I wasn’t doing well mentally. His response- “you’d never be able to tell. You’re always so on top of everything”. When I saw my friends last week they asked how me and the girls are. I told them the girls are great but things are a lot right now and I’m kind of going through it. They said “you’re a super mom. I don’t know how you do it every day.” I just want to yell IM NOT AND I CANT THATS WHAT IM TELLING YOU. I feel so dismissed. I’m trying to tell people who care about me that I’m struggling, but I feel like nobody listens unless I will straight up say I’m super depressed and anxious and have really bad thoughts. 

I am seeing a therapist and she was a huge support last week, but it’s not the same. I’m also on medication for PPD and PPA. It just seems like I’ve hit a bump in the road. But when I’m looking for support from the people who seem to care about it, there is no support. It’s not helpful to hear “super mom” and “you handle everything so well” because I’m literally not handling it well!!!! There’s no village anymore. There’s nobody who actually helps when I ask for help and I’m over it.",,"last week one bad mental health week long time mo baby yo start work home baby go sleep regression know make everything bad tell husband tuesday last week rough mental health day ask anything could never know answer people ask lol like yes sure well anyway decide last week go start work work time do dinner time bedtime girl handle everything kid bring end week say not realize bad handle really well kind dismiss break choice tell suffer mentally life lot early week know go lot right death family family issue work not push

My uncle yelled at me and I started crying and he started yelling at me for crying (he has his own mental issues, but regardless I think I'm done spending time with him for a bit) and I just went and hid so I could cry some more. It feels like I'm always a snide remark or sideways look away from crying or losing my marbles at somebody. None of the meds my doctor has had me try have worked. Including the one that was supposed to work really well for me according to the genetic testing they did. The only exceptions are kids. Kids are easy. Especially my own.

31,340,"I had my first baby September 29th 2024. The delivery was an induction and everything went well with the labor. At my 6 week appointment in November I broke down to my OB that I was feeling disconnected from the baby, crying at everything, not looking forward to anything, would find myself anxious and not laughing at anything my husband said or just jokes in general. Once I was in a weird mood it was so hard to get out of. She had recommended I try counseling, go on an SSRI like Lexapro, or try Zurzuvae. She explained to me that it is a fairly new drug. You only take it for 2 weeks ,and that it does make you drowsy. I opted to try the Zurzuvae. You have to take the medication with fat so I would take it at night with ice cream. My husband did those night shifts with the baby. The first few nights I felt really drowsy and dizzy. By the time I woke up I felt okay to care for the baby but definitely still tired. Eventually it wore off towards the end of taking the meds. I do feel like around the 3rd day of taking it I felt in a much better mood and then from there I have felt better mentally. I started to laugh again. I felt so much more connected to the baby. I would honestly recommend taking this medication to any woman who is struggling with postpartum depression. It really helped me and I liked the fact that you only had to take it for 2 weeks instead of being on it more long term. 

I am off the medication for 2 months now and I still feel pretty good mentally. I guess the only thing I noticed was that I have a lot of rage and anger that I didn’t have before pre pregnancy. It’s more near my period so I’m sure it’s just my hormones still being all over the place or just life circumstances right now. This doesn’t change my opinion on taking the medication because I would totally still recommend it. However, it makes me wonder if my anger is due to the medication being worn off or my hormones not being back to normal yet. I have started therapy and I also think that is helping as well with me learning how to cope with my anger. 

I am posting this to share my experience with this medication.

32,346,"Background: I’m 8 months postpartum and still breastfeeding. I’ve slowly dropped all night feedings and just dropped down to 4 feedings during the day time. I got my period back around 4.5 months postpartum and my last period sort of never stopped. I’ve been spotting on and off for 3 weeks now. It’s not heavy but it’s touch and go and pretty much every other day light bleeding. My mental health has slowly gotten worse. 

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and I am diagnosed ADHD with OCD tendencies and behaviors like skin picking. The past month I’ve been experiencing mood swings that change within a 10-20 minute span of time or even shorter. It’s like one minute I’m so excited and happy about life and can’t wait to do the next thing on my list of to dos, and within ten minutes I’m enraged by the smallest little thing and feel so angry and hopeless. It’s like im sitting outside of my body watching myself behave like a child because of the most ridiculous little things and I can’t stop myself? I’m not sleeping well at all either. My LO sleeps through the night so i have no reason not to be getting good sleep but it’s like I wake up exhausted as if I’ve been working out all night. I’m a little bit paranoid and really anxious and I feel myself getting angry all the time and then it switches to joy and happiness so fast. It’s pretty scary. 

I have a psych appointment scheduled in a couple of weeks to discuss medication and I’m getting a Pap smear Tuesday to make sure everything’s okay there. I’ve been in therapy for years but had to stop in November to afford childcare.

My husband is overly obsessed with his extended family in my opinion. My SIL comes from a mother country, despite having two kids and working my husband takes her to school every night at 7 and picks her up at 9 every night despite the fact that we live in a city where trains and buses are everywhere. 

She’s home all day during my maternity leave but cooks in the kitchen all day. I don’t know what for. Maybe boredom! I do not eat those foods but my kitchen is ALWAYS occupied. Sometimes my baby only sleeps 30 minutes, with eduaobkwt pumping I need ro wash the bottles or pump and get things in the kitchen but she is always there!!!!! Crowding my space

Me and my husband barely have any time together due to him working and the kids. When we do have a few minutes together she never excuses herself to give us one time to eat in the kitchen or just to chat. In fact on a daily basis she tells my husbands stories of what happened with my toddler before I her a chance and then overallks and interiors our conversations regularly where I can’t get a word in. 
She stays in the kitchen with my husband while he cooks and I’m there too pumping and doesn’t remove herself, just talks to him in their language I can’t understand because she doesn’t speak English.

it ends up explosive and I have to walk on egg shell with feedback on his family. We have been to therapy many times about other family members in the past that he had livinf with us:
He wants her to come to church with us and be 100% integrated in our lives: there is no plan for her to move out because he is trying to find her a job but she has no skills and can’t speak English. sometimes I feel like a third wheel I hate it here.

35,364,"I feel bad even writing this out into the void. 

I feel like I do have postpartum depression. I really really thought I wasn't. I was excited to be on leave with the LO and bond all throughout pregnancy. 

Now that I am about 6 weeks in I feel as if I destroyed my life and my partners. I miss the life before with my man and my cats. It was quiet and peaceful. 

Now my days are spent dealing with my baby who just screams and cries and refuses to settle. (Just got over a 3 hour session. We both cried and I excused myself to scream into a pillow). I've tried swings, bouncers, baby wearing, headphones, I went through the check list on a loop hungry, diaper, burp, check clothes, check temp. It all just eventually ends in him falling asleep from crying or screaming so much I guess

Doctors assume he's colic and will grow out of it. I am pumping since he couldn't latch due to my nipples being a little bumpy due to having neurofibromatosis. I feel sometimes it's my fault he's colicky because of my milk, but doctors say he doesn't have CMPA and don't recommend me changing my diet since he's gaining weight and is over all healthy. 

I want to run away. I don't want this right now. I'm so tired and touched out. I hate being alone with the baby for 10 hours a day while my partner works. 
He does everything in his power when home to help, but at that time I'm at the breaking point and I feel so bad for being short with him. 

I just don't know what to do. I have my 6 week postpartum check up tomorrow and I'm scared if I'm honest on how I feel they will take my baby away, or commit me, or judge me. I just feel bad for being depressed because I allowed this pregnancy so essentially this depression and anger is my fault in my head.

41,395,"Hi my fellow moms. I’m a first time mom (30 years old F) with a previous history of anxiety and panic disorder. I’ve always wanted a family, and a baby and suffered a miscarriage last year around October which broke me. Me and my husband tried again and a few months later in Feb I found out I was pregnant again. I was so excited and surprised at the time since I had no pregnancy symptoms compared to my first. Fast forward a few months in the pregnancy, I remember taking a shower and feeling panic over the thought of being pregnant and having such a huge responsibility of caring for someone and being a mom. I had a panic attack but my husband held me and reassured me it’s ok to feel this way and that I’d be a great mom. Long story short the pregnancy was not easy. I had horrible pelvic girdle pain and back pain, had to leave my job which left us a financial strain, and unaware to me has elevated my anxiety to a whole other level. 

Now 6 weeks postpartum out of nowhere I started experiencing very dark intrusive thoughts of harm OCD and compulsion and urges. Things that just don’t make sense to me considering I wanted a baby and everyone who knows me has always said I’d be an amazing mom. I would look at my son and visualize him not there or harming myself (which I would never do) and then my anxiety kicks in and I would feel a loss of control and even more panic attacks. I feel depressed, anxious all the time, I don’t eat, I’m scared to be around my child at times, as if I’m a liability or a danger and I can’t seem to understand why this is happening to me. A few weeks ago I was happy, never occurred to me having these intrusive thoughts, happy to have a family and already talking about more kids with my husband and now I feel lost. I spoke to my husband about all this, and went to see my Ob and was prescribed Zoloft. I’m not a medication type of person, never been on any meds always just dealt with my anxiety disorder and was wondering if anyone else experienced this and if the medication helped? Asking for some reassuring words on here from other moms who may have been in similar situations or having a hard time adjusting or experiencing harm ocd and how it was managed and that everything will be ok.

43,404,"I had my son (my fourth child) last June, and was diagnosed with “major depressive disorder” in August. They put me on Zoloft and it ended up making my life a living nightmare. After nine days of trying to “push through”, I got off of it and decided I would just try to fix myself without medication. 

Over the next several weeks I ended up spiraling deeper into the depression and anxiety. Fast forward to October and my OBGYN diagnosed me with PPD/PPA that was on the severe end of the spectrum. 

She put me on Lexapro and it started to make life easier. It also calmed down the panic attacks and helped bring my appetite back (I’d been losing weight very rapidly). 

I’m now 7 months PP and still struggling. I’ve been on the Lexapro for three solid months. And while it has helped improve my quality of life, I feel like my mind is still very unwell.
Every day I’m battling suicidal thoughts and obsessive thoughts about losing the people I love (my husband, my children, and my mom).

My thoughts are very dark. And I feel very fragile…as if one painful event would be my undoing. It’s been a tough two years. My husband is battling cancer, my baby was born with a heart defect, and I found out I was in the precancerous stages of cervical cancer when I was 6 weeks PP.

But nothing has compared to this pain.
I feel broken and scared that things aren’t going to get better. 

With all that being said, my doctor mentioned that if the Lexapro didn’t help me, we could add in an antipsychotic medication on top of the antidepressant.

I’m so scared. I was already very hesitant to get on the antidepressant (several of my family members have a history of alcohol/medication abuse and I’ve always tried to avoid medicine). 
I don’t want to get on a second medication but I don’t know what else to do.

I was meeting with two counselors (at different times) but I’ve had to switch twice for various reasons. I’m currently waiting to meet with a new counselor on Friday.

Has anyone had to take an antipsychotic on top of the antidepressant? I would love to hear your stories.

I just needed a place to vent. I feel horrible, and it feels like my mental health and overall outlook is getting worse. I had my first baby in November. She’s absolutely beautiful and literally the easiest baby ever. I had a smooth pregnancy, but a terrible birth. Since then my symptoms are:
-Feeling like a failure as a wife and mother
-Doubting my abilities/fitness to be a mom which causes an immense amount of shame and fear
-Hopelessness/doom/feeling like I made a mistake 
-worried about my mental state, as living this way is not sustainable and it feels like a nightmare 
-intrusive thoughts that bother the crap out of me.
-frustrated that no matter how happy I want to feel, my brain will not let me

46,415,"Update: 

Please read anything here if it adds to your data in search for Zurzuvae info. But my case was complicated by a quick benzo taper (8 days taper after 1 year treatment on them), and I couldn't figure out if I was headed for the mental hospital due to withdrawal from benzodiazapines on top of untreated severe panic disorder, or the Zurzuvae, or both. 
As of yesterday, day 6, I did not take the Zurzuvae night dose and don't plan to anymore. My panic attacks on day 5 were Soo severe I was going to be landing in an ER. I decided to go to a slower benzo taper and see where I'm at after that (which will take a lot of time.)

Good luck to all struggling with PPD. I wish I could've given a full picture that wasn't too complex. But my case was too wacky to get a clear look at whether Zurzuvae was beneficial or harmful or what. 


Original post:
Hi! I used to ravenously look around Reddit for experiences with Zurzuvae and came across a few posts that spelled out their experience. I thought I would contribute. I started Zurzuvae yesterday.

I can put real updates as each day goes along. The first thing I noticed is that both myself and my breastfed baby slept extremely deeply last night. 

I also noticed that, despite feeling tired from it, I have this pretty defined boost in mood and a sense of ability to just do things rather than get really dramatic about how hard they are how bad at them I am lol.

That could be a placebo effect, I just don’t know yet.

As soon as my baby woke up, she said a few words in order and this is the first time she’s spoken that way: she’s eight months old. She said very distinctly hello mom, and when I took her in to see her dad, she also said hi dad. kind of freaky! I need to note something controversial here. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder which I started being treated with benzodiazapines in my pregnancy about exactly a year ago. I just did a benzodiazepine taper this past week. This means that my baby's receptors are also going through a withdrawal of some kind just like mine are. The thing about Zurzuvae is that what it does is: it enhances the GABA effect in the brain in and on the same GABA receptors both extracellular and intracellular as benzodiazepines. But it up-regulates these receptors rather than down -regulates them. Part of why I decided to taper off of that class of medication for anxiety is because it had down- regulated my receptors so much that I had to keep increasing the dose of medication in order to control my anxiety levels, and it just felt like there was no end in sight to these increases. I wanted out. So that taper ended two days ago and I was feeling it. It did not feel good. But after taking Zurzuvae, the withdrawal feelings lightened considerably. For the first time in a year, I didn’t wake up with heart, palpitations, and anxiety. We’ll see where this goes! I know that a lot of people had ups and downs with this medicine. They would have really good days and then they’d have a really bad day. So, I am trying to remain neutral and not hope for too much.


Update edit: 3.5 days in
Below you will see a rant on how I was going to stop this medication due to feeling it triggered an outbreak of herpes simplex one. I spoke at great length with my Doctor Who spent actually quite a bit of time looking up the validity of whether or not this medication could’ve triggered such an outbreak. There’s actually a study done that this type of pregnelonone can be more anti viral with this virus if it’s resistant to typical anti virals. She convinced me to keep going but to take high dose Valtrex to get the infection under control. I’m here to say it seems to be working!! I asked my pharmacy to refill the valtrex generic I was taking with a different generic company and that seems to have done the trick. The generic I was on is notorious for being ineffectual so I switched and the medication worked to put my cold sore outbreak into remission.

I’ll continue to provide updates.
Notably, my baby has a cold and is 8.5 months old. This is the first time she’s ever gotten sick. I leave it to the unwritten history of the present and future to come to the conclusion whether scientifically her immune system is negatively impacted by the Zurzuvae in my milk.



2.5 days into treatment:
I am going to discontinue this medication. The reason for this is not because of how it makes me “feel” psychologically. I think it was actually helping me a lot in that way, doing a lot for me in terms of helping the glutamate in my brain and Helping me feel even -tempered. The reason I’m stopping is because apparently since it’s a steroid, it has caused an enormous outbreak of herpes (oral )on my mouth, which no amount of antiviral is stopping. Since a child, even one pill of valacyclovir has caused a cold sore to start to recede. I have taken four doses of this treatment and The cold sores are only spread spreading faster and more painfully. This hasn’t happened to me since I was eight years old and I didn’t have any type of treatment to stop the outbreak. Having this is extremely dangerous for my eight month old baby. And she’s getting this Neurosteroid through my milk as well as being exposed to the herpes virus. I’ve had two outbreak since she was born and was able to stop the attack within hours by taking my prescribed antiviral pill. This is now 2 days Without improvement. The cold sore on my lip appeared within five hours of taking my first dose of Zurzuvae.",,"update

48,424,"My little lady recently turned 4 months old. She’s perfect. In every way. It’s hard for me to say anything beyond that about her. 
I’ve become quite jealous of the amount of sleep she gets. If only I could sleep for that long, uninterrupted. 
I had a pretty rough pregnancy, being put under short term disability for the last few months of pregnancy as my job is quite active and difficult as a large pregnant woman. I was induced at 39w2d and was then forced to have a C-section the next day due to infection. I was in and out of the hospital for the following month due to infections and incompetencies in the hospital I gave birth in. Luckily, my husband was there to help me (for the most part). 
The following month, right before my 8 week leave was up, my husband had a major back surgery, which brought his father to stay with us for his 6 week healing process. Little needs to be said, other than at that point, I had to not only care for my baby, I also had to care for my husband and his father. While working 12 hour shifts, 4 days a week. 
I’d wake up at 430am, feed the baby, clean the house, prepare dinner for that night, and make sure that everything was in perfect order so that I wouldn’t have to do a lot when I got home. But yet, somehow, even though I had made sure that the house was clean, I’d come back to the same mess as before. (And continue that on rotation for 6 full weeks). 
Finally, after my husband had started to feel better, I could see that he was actively trying to make it easier for me. Unfortunately, his father didn’t feel the same way. I’d come home after my 12, and he’d want a congratulatory cookie as ‘he put the spoon in the dishwasher’. I dealt with it. 
As thanksgiving rolled around, he was still at the house. We went to my brother in laws. With my husband still healing, it’s hard for him to transverse stairs- especially with large dogs attempting to also go up and down the stairs. We agreed to go on the condition the dogs aren’t going to be in the way to trip over. We felt we weren’t listened to, as dinner was held in the basement, with the 8 dogs that were at the house. 
We brought the baby and my father in law had asked to have a picture of his grandchildren. In the beginning, I had told him no. I don’t want the boys (7yr & 5yr) to be holding my (at the time) 2 month old. She is small, fragile and can easily be hurt or sick. 
This was brought up again right around Christmas. I caught a slight attitude because he calls my daughter (whom has a beautiful name and lots of nicknames that could be made from it) he calls her TINK. I told him to use her name. A version of her name. There’s plenty. I am now (according to my FIL) somehow the worst person in the world because I wouldn’t allow my daughter to be called something so offensive to people. But no, it’s “a term of endearment” for him. No, it’s offensive and rude that you can’t respect my daughter’s name enough to even call her by it. He also told me that I needed to respect him more as my FIL. I bit my tongue, as I’ve cut off my parents due to the same lack of respect for me as a human adult, an individual.- and he brought up how “they never do anything for me like HIS family does”. I’ve accepted that my parents aren’t in my life, they are toxic people. At the same rate, I’m not the person that is telling my husband to cut off his family. I DONT want him to lose his family in the same way I’ve lost mine. 
I’ve done everything in my power to be the best wife and mother I know how to be. But yet, somehow, I feel as if I’m not doing enough. 
Does this feeling ever truly end?
Does it always feel as if at a drop of a dime, I could just cry for hours and hours and hours on end?

I have a history of clots in my pregnancies due to a clotting factor FVL. I’ve had DVT and pulmonary embolisms in both my prior pregnancies. I’ve had the same high risk OB throughout all my pregnancies. My last pregnancy (he’s 9 months old now) was absolutely traumatic. I followed the same OB. She knows my history and even specializes in clotting factors in pregnancy. I had very painful contractions that would show up on the monitor throughout my entire pregnancy. My OB blew me off and even sent me to a social worker because of how often I’d call to get checked out because of my contractions and severe back pain. The point of the social worker was to put together a “trauma plan” because of being gaslit in the past during pregnancy (they missed the dvt and PE in my prior pregnancies) so I had a lot of PTSD… I ended up hemorrhaging in the middle of the night and was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital that was not affiliated by the OB I was following. It was very scary but thankfully me and baby were safe as I delivered 4 weeks early. they suspected an abruption the entire time but confirmed during a pathology exam of the placenta after delivery including a clot in the placenta….

55,463,"Context: My husband has always been so obsessed with me. Always very patient, kind, soft, loving, and such a good provider. 

After having my baby (8 months ago) I was going through a lot. Trying to balance a marriage while also trying to be a mother while also trying to take care of myself. I was also very particular about how things were done with my son and I probably didn’t come off very nice to my husband (who is a very hands on father btw) I wasn’t very nice to him, never name calling or yelling just talking down to him. I never realized how much I did it until I realized he was unhappy and told me how I made him feel. I have been making a conscious effort everyday to be better, but also really struggling with my own internal battles at the same time. 
He says everything I do just seems fake. He is so cold towards me and tells me he doesn’t know if he can look past the way I made him feel in those few months. I was battling so much and truly at my lowest. I completely lost myself in motherhood. I am not the wife I once was but I am really fighting to work through that. 
Our relationship/marriage has always been so easy.. we’ve never had to try or put in effort because it’s always been so natural to us but with a baby it’s a whole different story. He thinks it’s been long enough since we’ve had a baby and we should basically be getting back in our groove by now but I think otherwise. I think it takes more time than just 8 months to try and figure out how to manage a baby and a marriage at the same time. 
I feel really sad that he tells me he sees me differently after seeing me at my lowest postpartum but I know he is going through things too. He is actually debating on divorcing me over it. I guess I never realized how much I hurt him during those months but I wish he would be more understanding of what I was going through or of what I am still going through. I do all the night wakes because he works so I can stay home so I haven’t gotten solid sleep for 8 months..

I recently just got released from a behavioral center because I was having thoughts about harming my baby. I went to the ER immediately and my daughter is with trusted family. Id been taking Zoloft since August and I saw no improvement whatsoever. It actually made things so much worse. Today wasn’t any better and we’re getting ready to have dinner and celebrate Christmas Eve. I feel like I should be happy like everyone else but I just feel sick. I can’t even look at another baby without thinking about how other parents can look at their baby and smile. I know that sounds horrible but I’m not sure what to feel anymore. They put me on more meds and maybe my body just isn’t used to it yet. But I’m tired of taking so many meds and I feel empty. I’m not allowed to be with my baby alone anymore as requested by her pediatrician. I’ve never harmed her physically but at the same time, I kinda get it. 

I went to the ward willingly because I know what I’m feeling isn’t normal. I cried every time I told the doctor why I was there. I love her but I’m just not happy like I used to be when I was pregnant. I feel like I sound harsh because it’s not my baby’s fault. It never was.

57,475,"My husband and I have been really struggling after having our son. (8 months ago) 
For context, my husband has always loved me so so much and I’ve never questioned that. He has always taken such good care of me especially early postpartum. We have always had such a strong bond, always laughing together, and always flirting. We were so solid. 

But Suddenly there’s been a shift, he acts like he fucking hates me. He hates the sound of my voice, my face, everything. Of course he has never said it but I can just tell he does by the way he looks at me. When I talk, he is uninterested. When I dress up and look hot, he is uninterested. He tells me he doesn’t know why he can’t be happy in the marriage anymore. I am trying everything I can while at the same time trying to find myself again after having a baby. We are not doing well financially either, my baby weight will not fall off, and I am just feeling like I am at the lowest point I’ve ever been at. I have nothing going for me either, no education above a HS diploma and no job. I feel absolutely worthless. I feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

58,479,"Hi everyone! I’m a 25M husband to my beautiful 24F wife, started dating when we were 19 and got married 2 years ago. A little backstory before I get into it. About a year into our relationship we both started talking about kids in the future and she expressed she had a fear of going through postpartum mainly because Bipolar depression runs heavily in her family, she’s been in therapy since she was 14 for her anxiety and said her therapist told her she hasn’t shown any signs of BPD so when we found out she was pregnant both of us kind of went in with high hopes and positive thoughts, thinking everything would be fine. 

The pregnancy went smoothly, some mood swings here and there but nothing too rocky. And then 9 months later she’s just popped out our little girl and as soon as we got home from the hospital it was like an instant shift in her energy. She’s naturally a calm and laid back person, but this time I could just tell the difference between them. Our conversations were short, she responded with one worded answers or shook her head yes and no when I asked questions. She just went completely blank all around. It was like talking to a wall.

One night I sat her down and tried to talk to her and she just broke down, and sobbed, screaming crying for hours. It was so heartbreaking that I started to cry as well, she’s never cried in front of me like that before. She had cried herself to sleep and the next morning I didn’t want to rush her or make her uncomfortable by asking what happened last night so we never ended up talking about it

Fast forward to last week and she’s doing her usual one month check in “she’s had to switch from weekly to once a month since the baby”. The room she does her sessions in is right next to the laundry room and I was in there grabbing clothes and I overhear her crying. Obviously as a worried husband I stop to listen and I hear these words “I feel so guilty being here. I don’t know why god gave me a child, I feel like I’m not deserving of motherhood, I just can’t be here anymore. I’m so tired” and more suicidal thoughts that she’s had.

I need my wife, my daughter needs her. But god would I do anything to take away her pain and carry that suffering for her. I just want to see her smile and laugh again, I want her to feel beautiful, and loved because she deserves the world. My heart just breaks for her, and as a husband I feel like I should automatically know what to do. But I don’t. I’m so stuck.

So for any mothers out there that have dealt with something similar what can I do to support her? No wrong answers",,"hi everyone husband beautiful f wife start date get marry year ago little backstory get year relationship start talk kid future express fear go postpartum mainly bipolar depression run heavily family therapy since anxiety say therapist tell not show sign bpd find pregnant we kind go high hope positive thought think everything would fine

I love him and he's an excellent dad to all our kids. I'm just currently in the weeds with the baby which I expected.
What I didn't expect was how much she doesn't like me. When she sees her Dad she sobs to be held by him, she only ever reaches for me for boobs. She always has the biggest smiles for him and when I try and babywear to take her out or do chores she is miserable unless she's feeding/asleep.
I make sure when I'm hanging out with her that I'm focussing on the baby, the tv will be off and I'll play with her or read to her or just generally work hard to keep her engaged but all he has to do is hold her and she's overjoyed. I cry about it every single day.

64,498,"Hi guys,

I'm a first time mama and by the title you should know that I have no one to talk which is why I've resorted to reddit. I'm 10 months postpartum with my beautiful baby boy and I couldn't be happier to have him choose me as his mama. The way he smiles at me just instantly clears my head of any of the thoughts I'm having. He's a cute little velcro baby who literally can't stand to be held by anyone but me and his dad on occasions. That being said, I'm burnt tf out and extremely lonely. I moved from NYC to a whole other country across the world to be with my family to support me through this new stage in my life. The same way they supported my brother with his first born. That being said, things are not going as expected. The village I thought I had is pretty much non existent and it hurts. I witnessed my mother be a grandmother to her first grandkid and was so excited to bring my own life into this world to see how she would treat him, but he isn't getting half as much attention as my niece and my mom uses the excuse that he's a ""mammas boy"" and that she's getting ""too old"". I've also been seriously hurt by my sister in law who is a manipulative snake. She gave birth to her second baby around the same time as me giving birth to my first and completely ripped the moment away from me. Didn't let me have a welcome party for my son because she wanted to have a welcome party for her son around the same time. She also complained to my brother that my mom wasn't helping her when my mom explicitly told her that she would help her once she made me food. My mom had offered to make me food because i was sleepless with a colic baby and also had stitches down there so could barely move which made it hard for me to get food for myself. My brother comes up to me after his wife complains to him and starts yelling at me asking me why I couldn't wait to eat because his wife needed help and no one was helping her. I immediately lashed out and started crying hysterically while I was breastfeeding my baby. At the time, we were all staying at my mothers but once that fight happened, I packed my bags and left. So ever since then I pretty much haven't been getting the support I needed from my family. My husband has been helping as much as he can but even he's burnt out. We haven't had sex in almost two years and I physically cannot have sex because the nurse at the time of my delivery over stitched me so I need to go back to the hospital and get a reconstructive surgery so till then we haven't been intimate with each other and that's also causing some trouble between us. We've tried to go on dates before and left the baby with my mom but she called us and told us that she couldn't do it and that he was crying hysterically because he only wants to be with me so since then we haven't had time alone. I just feel like everything is falling apart and I'm swimming back up for air at this point...",,"hi guy

65,510,"So I’m an 18 year old mummy to my beautiful almost 6 month old twins. I’ve been struggling silently for a long time and recently decided to tell my health visitor as it’s become a lot worse lately. 

I have a really bad fear of being sick which is why I’m always so scared to start new medication. I was prescribed this a few weeks ago and decided that I want to wait to start it after Christmas. 

If this medication caused you dizziness or caused you to pass out. Please DO NOT TELL ME!!! It is my worst fear to be dizzy and pass out. 

How was your experience with this medication? How long did it take until you started feeling happier ? Did it help with anxiety as well as depression ? Did it make you throw up? What side effects did you have and how long did they last ? Is there anything I can do to make it easier for my self ? 

My main question is will I ever feel normal again ? My anxiety started when I was 14 years old. It came on so suddenly out of no where. It was Halloween night 2021 and my ex boyfriend got extremely paralytic drunk. He was throwing up blood and I thought he was going to die. It traumatised me. Since that night I started having panic attacks daily and stopped going to school. I developed severe emetophobia ( fear of being sick ). Things have never been the same since. It always gets better in the summer. I am able to leave my house a little more often than in winter and feel less shitty generally. I dropped out of school and never went back. So I missed the last two years of high school which is a real shame because I was so smart and had really good grades. I’d always dreamt of being a neonatal nurse. I could leave my house by my self without giving it a second thought. I could go into town with my friends and do whatever I want with no worries at all. I have tried counselling in the past and i hated it. It didn’t do anything for my anxiety or depression. My mum also paid a lot of money for me to have private hypnotherapy. And again that was a big waste of money and didn’t help me at all. Will I ever be able to do that again ? Or will there always be some of that anxiety in the back of my mind. ?",,"year old mummy beautiful almost month old twin struggle silently long time recently decide tell health visitor become lot bad lately

She is usually a fun loving person but nowadays even though I’m still able to make her laugh, I feel there is a constant sadness deep within her. I know breastfeeding has been hard on her because that is something she said explicitly. Her mood is especially bad in the morning, at times she cries just after waking up. I’ve tried to open her up and tell me the issue but she does not say anything. I’m 100% sure that something is wrong but I don’t what it is exactly or how to help her. I can take her to the doctor but without her willing to go I don’t know how to do that. 

One more thing that I’ve noticed but I maybe wrong as this is my observation is I feel a lack of bond with the baby. She gets irritated that the baby has to feed this much. This is first baby for both of us so I can’t really tell as an observer what is normal. But I definitely don’t see any joy in her while she is breastfeeding.

Another thing that she has mentioned is that I leave her alone. We have a lot of help at home so the workload is definitely not something that would bother her but me going to office or golf, could it be something that might bother her emotionally?

I know I’ve not given enough information but this is all I’ve. What should I do?

Edit: thanks for all your recommendations and support. I’ve tried to get actively get more involved and just be there for her and things are significantly getting better. You all gave me some perspective which I didn’t have earlier.

69,529,"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling a lot lately and wondering if what I’m experiencing might be postpartum depression. 

I have two young children—a 6-week-old newborn and a 1-year-old. Most days, I feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and filled with moments of uncontrollable anger, often directed at my husband. 

My relationship with my husband has been strained since my pregnancies and during this postpartum period. He does help, but his efforts often create more work for me. For example, if he feeds the baby, he might lose the bottle lid, leaving me to search for it later when washing bottles. He doesn’t take initiative and rarely does things without me asking, which really irritates me. 

Stressful moments are the worst. If the baby has a blowout, I’m left frantically cleaning her up and looking for clothes while she’s crying, and he just sits there—either ignoring me or watching. The crying overwhelms me to the point where I start shouting, and his response is to go silent, which triggers me even more. We’ve talked about his inaction in these situations, but it feels like we’re going in circles. 

He recently told me he tries to leave the room or spend time alone because my shouting makes him feel triggered. This, however, only makes me feel more abandoned. I desperately want us to spend time together—not just for me, but for our kids. 

Arguments follow a predictable cycle. I say horrible things out of frustration, and he goes quiet. After a few hours or the next day, he starts acting like nothing happened, which makes me feel dismissed. It’s as though my feelings don’t matter. I feel invisible, as though my emotions and efforts don’t matter, and I’m constantly battling loneliness and frustration

I love my kids deeply, but I feel so disconnected from myself. All I seem to do every day is shout at my husband, say hurtful things, and cry afterward out of guilt and loneliness. 

Another thing I've noticed is that sometimes when my toddler won't stop crying I get sudden burst of anger and I shout 'stop crying' and I feel insanely overwhelmed.
Then I feel guilty and sad for shouting because he's just a baby, I feel like a terrible mother.

I’ve thought about reaching out to a GP or health visitor, but I’m terrified they’ll judge me as a mother or, worse, think I’m unfit and take my children away. As I'm writing this right now I'm sitting here crying because I feel like I'm failing as a mother and my children deserve better.

Could this be postpartum depression? Is postpartum rage part of it? If anyone has experienced this, I’d be so grateful for your insights or advice.

I have a health visitor visiting today so I'm wondering should I say anything? If so, what? I don't want her to think I'm an unfit mother and take my children away (that's my biggest fear) but I also want to know if this is normal and if there's help I can get. Btw I'm from the UK.

71,533,"Hey, my wife and I just had our second baby. We have three kids (I have one from a previous marriage.) One moment we’re happy and she’s fine and the next moment she’s pissed at me. She tells me I’m a good dad and I help with the kids, then the next moment she says I’m a child and I’m selfish and hard to deal with. We have ZERO romantic relationship. I try to make an effort but she doesn’t care at all. Today I was late picking up one of the kids from my parents, I was gone 1 hour. It takes 20 minutes to get there and back. I talked to my mom for 20 minutes. She freaks out, turns it into a huge argument. I mainly watch the older two while she watches the baby. I feed and change the baby, but it’s hard for me to help at night cause she’s breastfeeding. I feel super under appreciated, I cook almost every meal, I clean, I watch the kids, I take the oldest to school, I work nightshift. I make an active effort to consider her and get her things. One minute she loves me and the next moment she hates me. Tonight she said she wants to “give up.” I told her she needs to go to the doctor and get put on medication/therapy. It’s ruining our marriage. It’s like if one thing doesn’t go as planned in her head she goes off. I do have my faults, I can’t be 100% all of the time, there are times where I’m exhausted too.

Our second child is a hard child, he’s into everything, constantly throwing tantrums ( 1.5 yo M). It’s almost impossible to be around her, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, I just wait for her to explode. She blames me for everything. I don’t feel like she loves me at all, she says we don’t have a relationship. I can tell she is disgusted by me, she hardly ever touches me. I do whatever she wants, scratch her head or back, get her whatever she ask. I feel like I just serve her and the kids. I don’t feel loved at all by her.

73,541,"I’m 5 weeks pp today and I had my baby at 33 weeks and 3 days due to sudden severe preeclampsia and preterm labor. I ended up having a C-section. My boyfriend of 2 years has suddenly decided he is not sure if he wants to be with me anymore now. His reason is because I haven’t been cleaning and apparently I have never cleaned enough. Back story is, he moved in in April when I found out I was pregnant because he was going to be on house arrest due to a DUI and I became a SAHM in August when I quit my job to help take care of him after a motorcycle accident ( he is all healed now). I feel very blindsided by this but the PPD is kinda helping with the numbness I guess so I’m just like slowly processing it and I’m not overly upset. He has an alcohol problem that is suddenly becoming a problem again and I made him aware of the a couple days ago which obviously upset him and he denied it being an issue. He never offered to help me clean the house and I ended up asking my mother to come help me by sitting with my other kids and the baby so that I could clean because he left to go stay with his dad tonight and tomorrow I guess. 

I spent almost 3 weeks everyday at the NICU breastfeeding my son I was there from 7am-7pm every day. Ultimately the only reason he got to come home was because I stayed at the NICU for 48 hours straight breastfeeding because he didn’t do well with a bottle at all and the feeding was the only thing that determined how long he stayed. He’s only been home for 2 weeks now and I haven’t slept much so I sleep in fairly late after I take my other kids to school and try to make it a point to get up and clean something every day when I do get up. He’s had multiple days off work due to cold weather and spends his time drinking in the garage. Never offers to help and frankly I don’t want him to hold my newborn while he’s drunk anyways. He held him the other day for an hour (when he was sober) while I did some dishes and stuff and then mentioned his arm hurting and he can’t just sit in one position for that long. So I didn’t get much done. I’m just like confused how suddenly he doesn’t want to be with me because of a mess, but doesn’t want to help and was just saying how lucky he was to have me just a couple weeks ago. When I mentioned him helping he said “I didn’t make the mess and I pay the bills you don’t”. I didn’t realize I guess when I took on the roll of a SAHM I was going to be doing it completely by myself with no help at all. I also didn’t realize that months later he would decide to leave me where I have no job and 2 kids and a baby to be responsible for. I just don’t even know what to say or how to even feel.

74,549,"Need to vent but also need advice. 

I’m sorry but life was so great before getting unexpectedly pregnant. I thought it was what I wanted, but the poor decisions I made while being pregnant and post partum have ruined everything. 

I got pregnant, then spontaneously bought a house 9 months pregnant. I then had the baby. I then worked through my maternity leave from home because I was too concerned about losing money, it’s just not fair to have to go without pay for three months after suffering through the trauma of having a child. 

Then, my husband and I freaked out about the mortgage payment, so we stupidly listened to our shitty realtor and moved out of our BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION BEAUTIFUL HOME to move back in (in a way shittier climate mind you- I used to live in Vegas) back to my mothers hoarder house in NY because we also missed family and I can’t handle the baby. 

NOW, my house isn’t selling, I am wasting $3k a month on a mortgage. I left the best and easiest six figure position I had back in Vegas which I now can’t get back. The closest offer I can get is a massive paycut to where I’ll be eating into my savings each month to get by. 

I’m now stuck and probably going to have to take a loss just to get out from under the house. I’m now stuck on the east coast in this miserable shit hole in miserable weather. I could go back to Vegas but for a fucking price as I’m going to be working harder than ever for less money, lonely (I do love my family and the company) and on my own taking care of this baby while my husband will probably go work another shit job on an opposite schedule because it’s that or spend a fucking fortune on child care. 

I’m miserable in NY, I was miserable in Vegas but realized the west coast and weather there was so much nicer- but also can’t stand the loneliness. And now the fact that I will be busting ass to barely make it by. Or, stay in NY like a fucking loser living with my mother with the three of us cramped in a tiny bedroom. I can either quit my job once the house sells and rot away doing nothing because there is nothing to do in NY in this shit weather/nothing to do period honestly, I’m a nature lover and there’s none of that living right outside NYC. Or, I can stay at my job that I took coming here where I make money but deal with a dangerous and lengthy commute every fucking day (I’m talking 3-4 hours of travel every day) and the best part? When I get there there is nowhere to park. 

I have the option to either take the low offer, get my house and the beautiful west coast, but be miserable in the low offer job and struggling financially, struggling with loneliness and raising a kid by myself, or, sell the house likely at a loss (not willing to rent as that is also going to be a loss that I’m perpetually stuck with), and live in my moms shitty house in shitty weather in the shitty state of NY, but at least there’s some family around to keep company. 

What do I do now? I ruined my life. I feel like I am never going to be happy again. I enjoy nothing. My life is such a mess now (I can’t even unpack my things because of how cluttered the house is) we don’t even do milestone pictures (I can’t find anything), I don’t even remember to take them. He doesn’t have the space to play like he did at our other house but has family in his life now. But he screams because all he wants to do is explore and I have t gotten the chance to clean the mess and child proof the house.

77,569,"She’s not technically mine. I came into her life when she was a toddler just three years ago. Her mom isn’t in the picture, really. I took on the maternal role by choice. Everything was fine until my third trimester. She started becoming difficult in her behavior and the way she’d speak to me and that’s when DH started expecting more out of me, except I was exhausted from all the swelling I had and being physically uncomfortable all the time.

I’m 9 weeks pp and I’m having the hardest time getting her ready for school without her screaming at me while I tend to a hungry, screaming baby. And then picking her up from school is a struggle because it’s when baby needs his nap but he gets so overtired and cries and screams in the pick up lane and all I can do is cry with him. There have been many times where after I pick her up I have to pull into the parking lot to tend to my baby for about 30 minutes. I tried talking to DH about having her ride the bus in the afternoon as it would help me tremendously. He said no. 

Also the only other way I’m able to keep her from fighting with me is to let her watch tv or play her game. But when I tell her it’s time to stop, the screaming starts back up. But when I talk to DH about it he says I need to spend more time with her and that I’m giving her too much freedom. But all I want to do is nap after looking over a colicky baby.

On weekends when he has to work a lot, I pack up to go stay at my parents. I take the baby with me, but I can’t even leave until she gets out of school and I have to take her with me. I wouldn’t mind doing so, but she is always so disrespectful and rude to my family and when I scold her, all she does is scream so that she doesn’t have to hear me. I always end up feeling bad for staying with my family because of this. I cry all time.

Even now as I type this, she keeps knocking on my locked bedroom door. I just needed a moment to cry in peace while I put baby for his nap. But she keeps knocking on the door, which wakes up the baby, and I have to put him to sleep *again*. I just can’t stop crying and there are so many times where I want to just miss a pickup and go stay at my parents house for a few days with my baby *but I can’t*. 

I never expected to feel this way, but I also didn’t expect postpartum to hit me like this. Nothing I do is working with her. I’ve tried backing off and letting her do her own thing to keep the peace, but my husband gets upset with me for letting her watch TV all day.
Nothing is good enough. I can’t be the parent he wants me to be. But I can’t tell him that. I can’t tell him I want to die and that the only thing keeping me alive right now is our baby. I can’t tell him I don’t trust him alone with our baby and daughter because he hands the baby to her to hold while she’s standing up. She’s six year old and too young to hold a newborn if she isn’t sitting on the couch. I’ve had to take the baby back every time because I’m so afraid she’ll drop him. He’s even tried to make her hold the baby when she’s in a bad mood a few times and I’ve had to step in and say I’ll take the baby because I feel like she’ll drop him or throw him out of anger.

Everything seemed to be going great for the first few months, I got decent sleep when my husband or other family would take the baby, I was able to take care of myself and my kiddo, I ate properly for the most part (which is a huge deal for me because I've always struggled to eat enough). But over the last month or so, everything just feels like it's fallen apart and I don't know what to do. 

I didn't realize what it was at first. I would just get really angry out of nowhere and have to leave my lo in his crib for a few moments so I could step out of the room to calm down. My husband and I have spent a lot of time arguing over pointless things that have nothing to do with anything. My best friend and I (who happens to be our roommate in whose house we live) have had several arguments over stupid shit. 

And then all of a sudden about a week ago it hit me like a freight train. I kinda just sat on my bed, a little dazed at the realization of why I've been so upset. I thought about all the things that might have led up to that moment and realized how blind I'd been to my own emotions...

I've always struggled to keep my space clean but then I'd realized just how dirty my house is. I've never been consistent with scheduling but I realized how late I stay in ben now, and how it feels impossible to get up to do anything. A few weeks ago, I'd been physically ill and kept blaming my lack of motivation on recovery but I don't think that's the case anymore.

And my baby spends significantly more time crying now than he has in the past thanks to sleep regression and what I think might be the onset of teething, maybe? 

And then to top it all off, I tried to get help today and it sorta just ended in failure. I'd seen decent reviews on BetterHelp but it wasn't until after I'd payed the $50+ for the week that I'd found out how they don't hold up to their own standards so I canceled it without even thinking about it and now I feel guilty for spending the money to begin with.

Anyways, I guess I just needed to get this out there just in case my mental state decides to completely crash and burn...

Does anyone else feel this way this long after having a baby? I thought postpartum depression was an immediate thing? Everyone has always told me that if you don't get depressed right after birth then you won't experience postpartum depression...

80,595,"I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1b75ack/my_experience_with_zurzuvae/) so helpful when I was deciding whether or not to take medication for my postpartum depression, I wanted to add my own experience so other folks looking for help have more information.

TL;DR this medication saved me. I feel like myself again, and the side effects were tolerable. I will shout its praise from the rooftops

**Background**

I gave birth in September. FTM, mid 30s, I had an easy pregnancy. I've had several bouts of depression over the course of my life and struggle greatly with anxiety. I have always been resistant to taking SSRIs due to a bad experience with Zoloft years ago and being impatient with how long they take to work if you respond badly to one.

I had a rough birth and the first few weeks of postpartum were mostly survival mode, but I started feeling the old ugly feelings of depression getting stronger and stronger around week 4. Absolute feelings of failure, crying a lot, just unable to feel any joy. Feeling way too overwhelmed, weeping when I would look at my beautiful daughter because I felt like I was failing her. Failing at everything . Along with strong feelings of self harm which really scared me because I've never had that before. I got flagged by the depression screen at my 6 week appointment and my doctor suggested Zurzuvae. I was intrigued by the short dosage timeframe (you only have to take it for 14 days) and went and did all my internet research on it. I decided to try to get it.

My insuranced needed a prior authorization, but the process all happened behind the scenes. My regular pharmacy couldn't fill the order so they sent it to a specialty pharmacy. The sticker cost was $16k!!! My copay would have been $60, but the pharmacy was able to apply a manufacturer coupon and it cost me $0.

**Administration and side effects**

You have to take it at night (my doctor said it was fine to take with dinner like 6-7pm but be prepared to zonk out after, more on that later) and with a lot of fat in a 400+ calorie meal so it absorbs properly. I found this easy to do! I would rotate through some mixture of the following if my dinner wasn't fatty enough: avocado toast, a couple hard boiled eggs and strips of bacon, or a couple spoons of peanut butter and a slice of cheese, a serving of cashews... ""girl dinner"". I usually took it around 8pm.

It made me SUPER drowsy the first few nights. Like I would fall asleep on the couch within 30-1hr of taking it. For the rest of the course of medication I found I could take it a little earlier in the evening and it didn't affect my sleep at all. It made me sleep SUPER deeply regardless. My husband does overnight baby duty and good thing - I literally would barely wake up to the baby. (I do think if she cried loud enough I would have but it was crazy how hard it was to rouse me). I am lucky to have an incredible partner who was able to support me and allow me to get deep sleep every night so I could focus on healing my mind.

The morning grogginess was a whole other level. It was beyond grogginess. I was very wobbly and felt drunk most mornings - especially if my sleep was disrupted. If you've ever taken a Benadryl and stayed up afterwards, it felt like that. They are serious about not driving within 12 hours of taking it and I would wholeheartedly echo that recommendation, your reaction time is very off. I also had a weird side effect where my grip felt really weak in the mornings? Like it was hard to grasp things and I was kinda trembly. That went away after an hour or so every morning, and has not persisted since I stopped the medication. I was able to care normally for the baby during the day.

**Did it actually work?**

YES!!!! By day 2 I already felt it working. I literally felt my spirits lifting day by day. I stopped weeping. I started smiling. By day 4-5 that hateful voice in my head was already silenced, I started speaking to myself with more compassion and feeling like things were funny again. It felt like I was emerging from a deep, black pit and could see the sunlight again. By day 10 I remember distinctly thinking ""Wow, I feel so HAPPY"" and realizing I hadn't felt that in weeks. The best way to describe it ultimately is I FELT LIKE MYSELF AGAIN. It felt like it was a different person talking to me in the mirror every day while I was in the grips of postpartum depression and now I feel completely back to myself.

**Breast milk**

I was pumping at the time and ultimately decided to continue feeding my baby milk (we supplement 50/50 with formula). The studies on how much pass into breastmilk and what the effects may be are limited, but my pediatrician said she was comfortable with it and I trust her opinion. No effects noticed on baby, she is happy as can be and eating and sleeping well. I personally believed the benefits of continuing to give her breastmilk outweighed the unknown risks, and I was reassured by my pediatrician's response. I saw no effect on my milk supply negative or positive, but I was able to relax more and stop stressing / spiraling about pumping so much (iykyk).

**Other thoughts**

Other than the morning grogs, I had no other side effects and the benefits were immense. I will say it hasn't helped much with the anxiety side of things, I am still working through that. My doc warned it might not, so I was not surprised. I am doing talk therapy and starting on Buspar. But I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling with depression, I could not believe how well it worked and I am so thankful my doc recommended it.

I am curious to see how long the effects last (It's only been a few days since I stopped taking it). I can do an update post in a couple weeks if anybody is interested. Let me know if you have any questions, happy to share more.",,"find posthttpswwwredditcomrpostpartumdepressioncommentsbackmyexperiencewithzurzuvae helpful decide whether take medication postpartum depression want add experience folk look help information

I raged and I was so angry because he left me without a vehicle to move around in. I told him that if he left, he would be coming back to an empty house. I felt this rage and anger overpower me, it’s something I have never felt before. So I accidentally threw a candle that broke the stove glass out of anger because he would just say he was coming home and never got home. So I packed a suitcase and walked to the nearest hotel with my baby. Then I caught a ride to my parent’s house, which is an hour away from where I was at. He didn’t believe that I would leave and now he just told me he was done with me and that I was low class and that he was so disappointed.

It’s hard for me to accept that I’m the problem but he makes it seem like I am so crazy and angry all the time.

84,608,"I gave birth 3 years ago. During my third trimester my personality started changing. I stopped taking care of myself, eating, making doctor's appointments etc. My husband was obviously really concerned that I was dropping my responsibility of taking care of myself and my unborn child and he tried to take on the these I was leaving behind. Immediately after birth, I suffered from a severe spinal headache and what I now know to be postpartum depression. I don't remember much, but my husband has told me that he had to make me breast feed my daughter even though that was my plan and desire and it was terrifying for him because our daughter would not take a bottle. He felt helpless. At the time I was constantly feeling unsupported by him even though he was doing 90% of the work with our newborn and waiting on me while I recovered from my headache. After the headache subsided, the depression remained and when he tried to talk to me about it or have me seek help, I denied everything and blamed him for what I was going through. I finally started seeing a therapist and taking meds about 6 months after my daughter was born but I still persisted in trying to place blame on him whenever I was acting or treating him poorly. This caused him severe emotional trauma and I am only beginning to understand and take accountability for the things that I did and said after birth. We still have horrible relationship issues mostly stemming from my not listening to him in the beginning stages of our ordeal and not taking any accountability for my actions until very recently. I wanted to hear the opinions and experiences of others who went through postpartum and how it affected both sides of the relationship. Were you able to heal?

87,624,"This is probably not appropriate but I just need to get it out of my chest. I’m 7 weeks postpartum and my libido has increased significantly. Last week, in bed I tried to touch him and he took my hand away saying it’s okay that I’m tired from minding our baby, I said I’m not tired. Then he says because our 6 weeks old son was in the same room with us. I said ok, but I lowkey still felt embarrassed and unwanted. Few days later I was changing the rubbish bag in the bathroom and notice used tissues smell exactly like semen, the smell was strong, I didn’t have to bring it close to my nose . I felt betrayed, he’d rather masturbate then let me do it for him. I gained a lot of weight during the pregnancy, that plus i oversaw him and female coworker reacting each other’s message with heart made me evern more insecure, and that he’s probably not attracted to me anymore. 

We ended up leaving our baby with my mum and met up for dinner to talk about this. He said he’s still attracted to me but want to take it slow when it comes to us being intimate. And that he only heart reacted his colleague’ s message because she was talking about our baby, he offered to show me the whole conversation. But I refused.

A few night later, we were cuddling, and this time our baby stayed in my mum’s room. Still nothing happened. I tried to touch him but he pushed my hand away saying he’s tired and then just cuddled me. I feel like I have no dignity left at this point and feel disgusted of myself.

The next day I messaged and asked him what did he mean when he said he wanted to take it slow, I asked how long, he said a week ( a few has almost gone past). I don’t understand, he used to have high libido and was the one who initiated it most of the time and now he just keeps rejecting me. Same thing happened tonight, we cuddled a bit, he stroked my legs but then just stopped and went to be. I’m very sexually frustrated and I’m starting to feel like this will never happen. Should I tell him that I’m sexually frustrated ?

88,627,"I am a terrible mother and need to confess to the internet. I yelled at a stranger in front of my 11-week-old I mean, really lost my marbles, screaming at the top of my lungs, I almost punched her. Why isn't important, nothing should cause that. I did it in front of my partner and he says I violated a huge boundary. He hates public scenes and is embarrassed by me. I embarrassed myself. 

Then I tried to take a bath today during her nap and didn't hear my baby wake up and cry. My husband had to take her while he was on a work call. I then realized I forgot to change her. She had two blow outs back to back this morning (which I changed and cleaned her) and then she sat in the same diaper for 7 1/2 hours. She was leaking pee and I thought we had to size up diapers until my husband went to log the heavy pee diaper and realized my neglect. 

I feel so awful. I've been battling daydreams of suicide since the screaming incident but know that isn't an option now that I have my daughter. While I do think she would be better off without me, it would be too much for my husband to handle. And I think about my own mom and how much it would hurt her. So I have to stay alive, knowing I'm a worthless, terrible mother. Maybe it's a fit punishment for me?

She's a happy baby in spite of me, I don't deserve her. I just wish I could be happy for her because that's what she deserves. 

Living inside my mind is torture. I have a therapist but she cares more about the baby than me. I have a history of treatment-resistant depression and faulty serotonin receptors so SSRIs don't work. I've done ketamine therapy successfully pre baby but it didn't seem to work postpartum. I finally started zuzurvae but had to pump and dump for two weeks (tomorrow is the last day) and LO was vomiting the formula. I felt so horrible and guilty about causing my baby to be sick but my husband convinced me that it was important to try and improve my mental health. When I was talking to my therapist about it she recommended I stop the zurzuvae (at the time of the session I thought it was helping) when I texted her to ask for an additional session (we were every other week) after the screaming incident she asked about if the baby was keeping down formula and not about how I was doing. Then she canceled the extra session (reasonably) because she's sick. (There's a part of me that thinks she's avoiding me because she thinks I'm a bad mom too and doesn't know how to support me). So long and short to say, I'm trying therapy but it's making me feel more guilty and selfish, and I don't think the meds are working either. 

I'm so miserable and I know I'm making my husbands life awful by being like this. He's dealing with his own mental health issues and taking on way more than most fathers because I'm such a failure. 

To top it off I've developed urge urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence. I can't trust my own body and feel like I can't leave the house. I tried talking to my mom about it and she just said ""oh dear"" and changed the subject. She sent us some soup on Grubhub, she's a good mom just not good at the emotional support. (I'm in pelvic floor therapy, I started at 20 weeks pregnant because of a predisposition to these issues and it still happened) 

Who do I think I am bringing a child into this world? I'm not equipped for this, she's going to have an absent, depressed mother her whole life and I've ruined another soul. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this even. Maybe a catharsis? A confirmation that I'm awful. I can't stop replaying all the horrible things I've done.

I would never actually hurt her but I hate that the thought even crosses my mind. during the day I become irritated so quickly because she's such an active baby and literally will not stop touching/climbing me or biting me, pulling my hair, pinching me, etc. I feel that if I had more help, I would be a better mom.

90,642,"I just have to get this out here because I don't think people really know or can understand what I went through. 

I gave birth in 2020 and experienced a good 3 months with my baby. I had crying spells due to a broken family. My mom died suddenly in a car crash in 2018 and I guess my family just couldn't love me the same.

I was basically alone with a newborn, which was fine until it wasn't.

I stopped breastfeeding at about month 5, cold turkey. I did not wean my baby off like I should have. I didn't have any experience and I didn't have the support around me to help me to understand what and how I should have done things.

At about month 6, I started to feel completely disconnected to my baby. I didn't know what was happening. I eventually tried reaching out to my aunt for help, but she wasn't talking to me. I kept to a routine where I fed him and bathed him. But I didn't really interact with him, which was different from the months I had breastfed him. I felt like we were two peas in a pod then all of the sudden I couldn't hold him without feeling tired, and I didn't want to be tired.

I kept him in one of those baby gardens, like a giant pack and play, with all of his toys cause I was deathly afraid that he would severely hurt himself.

I had known about ppd, but I thought that it was like general depression and I had been depressed before but this was completely different. I was hallucinating, at one point my baby started to talk to me, my 5 month old baby answered questions with a yes and a no. I thought he was possessed.

Don't get me wrong I was scared at first. I went to the kitchen, placed him in his bouncers and just started sobbing, wailing, praying for God to give me back my baby. My baby looked at me with pity at one point in the night.

Eventually, this passed and he returned to what I think was his normal. But every so often he would look at me with this smug smile, like he was better than me.

I figured I was just going crazy on top of not being able to be the mother I wanted to be with him. But I still loved him with all of my heart regardless of what he looked like to me.

Fast forward to almost his 2nd birthday, I was being evicted from our house. I had made plans to go to a university 1.5 hours away and was looking for housing in that town. I couldn't hold a job because I couldn't stop crying while I was working. I constantly thought that I had somehow killed my baby, that either his death or my death was coming. 

I heard voices in my head that sounded like my family. I didnt want to hear from the family that shunned me, I thought they were all mad at me and was constantly confused and scared when I would hear them.

I visited family and told them that I was getting evicted but all I got was, you can't live with us. My estranged dad's wife asked me, while we were driving back from shopping, to their house, with her teenage daughter in the car ""Why don't you come to college in the town we live in?"" But since they didn't ask me to live with them, I didn't know that she was asking me to live with them. I said ""No"" as I had already registered to go to a college. Later, I found out this was supposed to be a formal offer to live with them...

So, I went back to the house I was getting evicted from and looked for housing in the college town. I thought I had found a good prospect and had borrowed $2500 from my grandma for the down payment and first months rent. It turned out to be a scam. So, I went to the college town with my child and thought I could book a hotel and look for housing around there. I ended up not being able to find housing, so I thought I could stay at an extended stay hotel. 

When I went to the extended stay hotel to confirm our room for the month, a cop car pulled up and brought someone from the hotel down in cuffs, so I canceled my reservation and started looking elsewhere. 

I ended up booking an Airbnb for a week, which took $1200 out of the money I had for housing.

While staying at the Airbnb, my neighbor told me that the owner of the house I was being evicted from started taking all of my stuff out of the house. 

I was super overwhelmed, so I stayed in the college town while all of my memories, clothes, and furniture got stolen or taken to the dump. My neighbor said that they had put a tarp on my stuff, but I didn't have the means or the mindset to move all of my stuff and take it to storage by myself. I didn't even reach out for help then as I had asked for it multiple times and had been denied. 

At this point, I had lost everything and barely had a penny to my name. I called my best friend's mom who had helped us move in to our house. I asked for money, but I didn't tell her what was going on. I could barely think straight. She said she would think about it. I called my best friend in a panic, it was a couple nights before her wedding and she told me her mom said no.

I stayed in the Airbnb until the last day. The cleaning lady came and I had it in my mind that they wouldn't throw out a single mother who had lost everything, really I was thinking that the house I was staying in was owned by my best friend's mom, who owns property over 600 miles away...

The cleaning lady came and I wouldn't let her in, stating ""I'll clean the house ""

Eventually the cops came and kicked us out. I didn't want to get arrested so I grabbed my baby and started walking down the street in our pajamas. 

When the cops left I went back, as my car was in the driveway of the Airbnb.

I got in the car and started driving, not knowing what I was going to do.

I called my grandma trying to get help, but she didn't answer. 

Eventually I came to the towns airport. My ex was an airplane mechanic who lived 600 miles away. I thought he was going to randomly show up at this airport that we had stopped at.

I took my baby to the bathroom to change his diaper. When I realized he didn't have diapers in his diaper bag, I broke. No one was at this part of the the airport, it was like for private customers, the only person there was a janitor.

Me and the janitor locked eyes, then I left to go to the car without my baby. I left him with the janitor.

I drove back to the Airbnb and called the cops, saying ""I lost my baby at the airport."" 

The cops came to the Airbnb and arrested me. 

My baby was taken into DCS custody and I was taken to jail.

I feel like I’m definitely dealing with postpartum rage and PPD. My husband is mad at me for having our son but he was the one who knocked me up with both of the kids. He has a “high libido” and always wants it every day. I’m exhausted from taking care of the kids all day. I can’t do it every day. 

He gets so frustrated at me and said that all I’m good for is having babies and being angry all of the time. But he has major anger issues. And believes that a small apology will make me move on. He says that I hold on to things but he holds on to things as well. He just believes he is oh so different from I am. 

Today is our anniversary and I was supposed to be making a cake and surprising him with it. But why should I when I’m good for nothing but breeding in his eyes?

My mother passed away. My ILs suck. My father was always away working during my formative years and my older sister even told us that he didn’t even want me and my little brother. Just her and my older brother. And now I feel like I married a guy who is just like my dad. And that feeling SUCKS.

98,667,"Today is so incredibly hard. I woke up this morning feeling so anxious before I even got out of bed. I needed to go to the grocery store this morning and also find some time to get in some work for my job. Now that I’ve had this realization that this life isn’t all what I want, my soul aches more than ever to be free.

I have dreams of leaving everything behind and getting on the next plane to a tropical paradise. I would have my daughter with me, and we would arrive and find a nice little outdoor restaurant to get some food. We would meet some of the local people and ask for their recommendations on nice places to sleep that night, and we would figure out the rest from there. No more bills, no more job, no more appointments or grocery shopping, no more chores. No more people to answer to or responsibilities of taking care of a house, possessions, and relationships that I don’t even want and don’t even serve me. Just nothing but freedom to go anywhere I wanted, do anything I wanted, and show my daughter the world.

In his book “Instructions for a New Life,” Markus Rothkranz talks about how all of this is possible. The only issue is that it’s much easier when you don’t have a child and have to get consent from another parent to take the child with you. I mourn that I didn’t have this realization when I was still single and completely unencumbered - if I could go back, I would give away all of my possessions and be on the next plane. I know I will figure it out and I will be free, but I now hate and resent having to wait. 

I had originally planned to make my move after the holidays, but I’m not so sure now. If the rest of my days are anything like today, I don’t think my mental health can take it, which is my top priority for not only myself, but my daughter’s sake. She needs me to be at my best for her, and I’m so committed now than ever to make that happen for her.

So we’ll see if I’m able to wait another six whole weeks or not. I feel a strong surging in my spirit that something may have to happen before then, and maybe it will be the crazy leap of faith that I’m needing to finally catapult my life in the direction it was meant to go.",,"today incredibly hard wake morning feel anxious even get bed need go grocery store morning also find time get work job realization life not want soul ache ever free

100,676,"I have a history of depression since high school and anxiety since I was a kid. I've also been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. I've worked with therapists and med management and was doing ok before I got pregnant. I had a miserable pregnancy, so honestly after like the first week post C-section I felt pretty amazing. Yeah, newborns are hard but compared to how depressed and sick I was during pregnancy I was honestly on a good high. Then my anxiety has been gradually worsening over the last 6 weeks and I reached out to get back on some medication which was helping a bit. 

However, 2 weeks ago we had to put my soul dog down. He was a black lab, my first dog, first ""baby"" and my husband and I adopted him together 11 years ago when we had been dating a couple years. I can't even put into words how much he meant to me and how devastated I still am losing him.

Basically since then I've been struggling so much with increased anxiety and low lows. Even starting to get suicidal ideations which I have struggled with in the past but not in years. Don't worry, no plans on acting on anything - I care about my baby too much and am also aware of the fact this is a mental health issue I need to get treated. I've been drinking too much too which then gives me crippling ""hangxiety"" the next day and messes with the little sleep I am getting. I am well aware I am going down a slippery path. I know I need to start doing things to improve my mental health and life choices. I'm overwhelmed though and struggling getting in to see a therapist after needing to switch from my last one who wasn't great with anything around having a child.

102,691,"Hi all, wasn’t exactly sure where to post this so hopefully this is the best place to reach anyone else out there who has experienced this. I’m 4.5 months postpartum and overall doing better but definitely still dealing with my majorly traumatic birth. I have been dealing with terrible PPD/PPA and finally started Lexapro which has been a game changer. Super long post warning-thank you to anyone who actually makes it through the whole thing! 

Got induced at 38 weeks due to my history of high BP and worry of pre-eclampsia and baby measuring large. Started with miso, things actually started moving quite quickly and had a foley bulb placed about 10ish hours later (HORRIBLE pain inserting and the contractions after…OUCH). It also worked, out in 3 hours and 3cm dilated. Started me on pitocin nice and slow. Finally, started working. I guess I should also say that I have a history of cervical cancer and have been through the wringer with OB stuff and majorly trusted my OB and really wanted her to be the one to deliver my daughter. She actually picked up a shift just so she could be there. So…she gets on shift at 7pm. Comes and checks me, 5cm dilated and baby was only at a -2 station but she broke my water anyway. I had mild polyhydraminos (extra amniotic fluid) so it was like a geyser. My contractions were IMMEDIATELY horrible. I then asked for the epidural. Got up and went to the bathroom and while in there heard the anesthesiologist come in so I came back out and my doctor was already back in and said she wanted to check baby. Ended up telling me I’m getting a VERY emergency c-section and ended up calling a code blue in the hospital bc baby’s cord had come out with all my fluid. I got put on my hands and knees with a nurse’s hand up me holding baby’s head off of the cord. I’m pretty sure every nurse in that hospital was in there and they raced me to the OR. On my way getting rushed down the hall, someone asked the nurse for a pulse check and she said she didn’t have a pulse, it scared the living shit out of me but apparently she just meant she wasn’t checking the cord for one since she was holding baby’s head. Better communication would have been nice. Since I didn’t have an epidural yet, they had to put me under general anesthesia so I missed everything � my parents and my in-laws got to meet my daughter before me. I don’t even remember meeting her because apparently they gave me a medication to hopefully help me forget some of the trauma but I remember every single second and only don’t remember waking up and meeting my daughter. From the time the prolapse was discovered to the time she was out was 9 minutes. It was insane and the most traumatic thing I’ve truly ever been through. I am SO grateful and thankful and all the things that my sweet girl is here and healthy with no lasting effects and that I made it through ok as well. But man, if I’m not still struggling to work through that and the loss of those firsts that I will never, ever get since she is our only baby. I still cry myself to sleep sometimes replaying it all. I just wish we would have talked and gotten me the epidural before breaking my water. Or just kept waiting to see how my body continued to react to the pitocin. I think the hardest thing for me is I went in with basically NO agenda/plan except for some hopes of delayed cord clamping, no wiping off of the vernix, immediate skin to skin, that kind of thing (which I got none of, of course �). I legit told my doctor the week before when discussing options that my ONLY fear was an induction that ended in emergency c-section under general anesthesia. She told me “that only happens every 2-3 years and is super unlikely”. I was ok with a vaginal birth, c-section, medication, whatever. Just NOT general anesthesia because I knew what that would mean. My heart is just totally broken over it all.

I aspire to open PP care centers as a non-profit community service. I am hoping you can take some time to answer some questions that I need answered to complete a school assignment this week ""Defining the customer profile"". This will help me complete the assignment obviously, but it will also help me refine what I want my non-profit u/postchoicefoundation to offer.I know I'm a doula, I promise I'm not going to pitch services to you.

1 What do you see? What does it look like?

2. Who surrounds you, who are your friends (single, no kids, fellow mamas? what kind of influence or affect do they have on you, and your PP issues?

3. What problems do you encounter, and what offers or influencers are you exposed to solve this problem, or make the problem worse?

5. What do you \_really\_ think and feel? What is the most important thing to you that you maybe don't say to your family & friends?

6. What are your emotions, what moves you, what motivates you? What keeps you up at night?

7. What do you actually say and do? What are you telling others? What do you say vs. what do you do and what do you think?

8. What do you really need? what are your biggest frustrations? what prevents you from seeking help, or achieving your goals? what fears are present when thinking about the risks associated with achieving these goals and getting what you really need or want?

9. What do you stand to gain by jumping over the risks & fears? How would you measure success? Do you have a strategy that you use to achieve your goals? what is it? What do you truly want or need to overcome PPMD, navigate newborn life, etc.?

110,717,"I’m 4 months pp. ever since I’ve had my baby I’ve been feeling very neglected and alone. My partner is mostly working and doesn’t have a lot of time to spend on taking care of the baby or me. I’m with the lo all day tending to her needs and trying to maintain a sort of a routine especially with sleep and stuff. I deal with her all day and at night when she wakes. I’m exhausted and burnt out with no time to take a break, exercise or just take care of myself. My husband is not very proactive and encouraging. I always need to ask him to help. When he does have time between work he sits on his phone instead of helping me out or spending time with me. Finally when he’s done at night he just lies on the couch waiting for me to get done with our baby’s night routine. If she starts crying in her sleep while we’re awake and getting stuff done, I always try to get her back to sleep which takes some patience and time. My husband can’t put in the time and just picks her up and brings her out into the living room which completely wakes her up. Then I have to deal with her at night and put her to sleep while he goes off to sleep. When I finally told him to stop, he now waits for me to go and deal with her while he scrolls or he’ll go in the room and scroll while mindlessly rocking her crib and she’ll be crying in it. Finally it becomes 12am by the time I put her to bed again. I pump during this time while we watch a show or something. But now he’s just started going to sleep (apparently he’s tired after all the work) and he asked me why I need to pump while he’s awake. I should apparently be choosing the show/ movie to watch instead. I’m so frustrated.

112,737,"Hey, so I've experienced this multiple times before I had a baby, but I think postpartum is triggering this to happen again. I have moments where real people don't 'feel real' to me anymore, typically people who have hurt me. I'm starting to feel like that with my baby daddy. I was thinking of him not too long ago, and suddenly every memory I have of him feels more like a dream. Like it never actually happened. I can barely remember what he looks like in person. I can't remember any other sense, like touch, smell, etc (I used to be able to). I'm not quite sure how to explain it further than that.

I have experienced this with small things here and there, too. Like I'll text someone, then forget I did, then think about it later in the day except I'm not sure if I actually texted them or if I dreamt that I did. I'd say about half the time it was a dream, half the time reality.

At first I wasn't too worried, because I just figured it was a side effect and the immense stress I'm in and sleep deprivation. But feeling like my baby daddy is not real is putting me through even more stress. I'm not sure if this would be considered derealization, or something else. So if this sounds familiar to you, please let me know!

114,753,"My Dad recently made a ""joke"" that has been hurting me ever since. 

For context, I'm 19 and I had moved out at 18 with my boyfriend at the time (now ex). We both had stable incomes. After I got pregnant, I lost my job and a couple months later he lost his. After we found out I was pregnant, the relationship got very toxic. I don't want to go too into detail, because it's not relevant to what my dad said, but to put it simply, we lost our apartment and broke up and now I live with my parents again. My baby is currently 4 months, and my ex doesn't do really anything at all to help provide. My brother helped me out a lot with watching my baby for the first couple of months, especially since I had a csection. I appreciate all the help, but one thing I struggle with is feeling disconnected from my baby and not feeling like a mother. I was insecure about my ability to parent and thought that my baby didn't recognize me and would think that my mom is his. My brother would also make jokes whenever my baby would cry whenever I'd hold him and say that my son didn't like me.

My Dad told me a couple weeks ago that my brother spends so much time with him that my son thinks he's his mommy. Then he made a joke that my son is secretly calling him mommy behind my back. Idk if this sounds like not a big deal, but that hurt me a lot, especially with everything I was already thinking about myself. It still hurts me now and makes it hard for me to ask for help even though I know I need it. I feel ashamed for the situation I'm in and feel like a terrible mother.

Sometimes I regret having a baby. And it hurts so much to write out because I'm holding my baby right now. I love him so much, I really do. But I'm tired of everything I'm going through and people making me feel worse for it. I hate that my ex can live freely and I can't. I feel like I'm a horrible mom and my baby deserves more. I'm tired of crying in front of my baby but having to smile through it bc I don't want him to see how sad I really am. My best friend made a joke too and asked me, ""What kind of impression are you giving your baby by couch surfing between your parent's houses?""

117,773,"Hi all,
I have a 6 weeks old baby.
For the first 5 weeks I was so happy and so attached to my baby, I was so proud of myself of how well I was doing it. Since the last few days, I’ve been feeling very anxious and the intrusive thoughts have come back again. I am constantly having the intrusive thoughts of harming my baby, doubting myself if I really love him, etc and it is torturing me, even to a point that I even feel dizzy of the high level of anxiety I am feeling.
I’ve been suffering from anxiety and pure OCD from the past and I go to therapy , but since I had the baby I was feeling much better. It was like everything was gone. I feel like all the strategies that my therapist have told me I can’t even put them in place anymore. I feel so overwhelmed.
I went to the doctor yesterday and he upped my dose of antidepressants so hopefully that helps because I feel so lost. 
I am hating the feeling of detachment I’m having towards him since the last few days. I am not sure if it is due the lack of sleep and the chronic fatigue as he is not sleeping much. 
I really would like to hear other stories to see if I am not alone in this position and gets better. 
I feel numbed, tired, sad, super anxious… I was always so caring and loveable person and I don’t understand what is happening to me. My baby is much wanted and he is all we were dreaming about.

122,790,"This is a situation that I’ve been having a hard time trying to figure out how to approach and deal with.. My husband hasn’t been helping with the baby as much as I thought he would. It’s been 7 weeks so far and I feel like he still hasn’t gotten a grasp of taking care of the baby or even really helping me with him. He seems to just do his own thing and he does tell me “if you need anything, let me know”, but I find myself not even bothering most of the time because I feel like I end up having to step in anyway. I have talked to him about it before and mentioned to him how I’m having a hard time, my postpartum depression has been effecting me a lot, and how I need him to help out more rather than just do his own thing at first. Prior to this, he did mention to me he had some depression which worried me. He does become rather avoidant of some responsibilities when he gets depressed. Which I’m not saying as an excuse, because I clearly am depressed too and have been having to deal with the majority of the baby care. He started to put in some effort, but I feel like he went back to not helping as much again. 
We do live with my parents for now because it’s easier for us financially and my husband is deploying overseas in January. Although I do highly appreciate the help from my parents, I feel like they have been helping more with the baby than my own husband and I can feel my dad’s judgement from across the room every single day about my husband’s lack of effort. It honestly stresses me out a lot. 
I’ve had two incidents recently that are starting to get me to my breaking point.. Yesterday I made a comment about going back to work possibly soon and he seemed upset about it. His paternity leave is much longer than my maternity leave (and even paid) so he essentially said he doesn’t want to take care of the baby alone which is why he doesn’t want me to go back to work yet. I found this extremely frustrating because I myself take care of the baby alone all the time. Not to mention I was only going back maybe 1-2 shifts a week for 4 hours (it’s a part time job) to ease into it. I also really love my job for once and have been missing it. It’s one thing I’ve been missing about myself prior to having a baby since I feel like I’ve been losing so much about me. 
Then today my baby has been extra fussy and a little harder to sooth him. When my baby is with my husband, he can’t seem to soothe him at all and my baby even seems to get louder. My dad tells me “you know why he does that with him? It’s cause he isn’t used to him” before he went to bed… 
Now I’m here stuck wondering what to do. I know my husband doesn’t mean to be like this. I know it’s not malicious or anything like that “you’re the wife/mom so it’s your job”. I really feel like he gets very overwhelmed trying to take care of the baby and doesn’t know how to go about it even when I’ve tried to help. I don’t want to nag him or get on him like he’s a child, but I also don’t want him just getting away with all of this. He’s leaving to go overseas soon and I really don’t want him missing out on the first few months of our son’s life because he’s not even going to be able to see him again til he turns 1.

124,800,"I'm dealing with postpartum depression and anxiety and although we had our baby 8 months ago, it's still very intense. I'm in therapy, medicated, but as you all know, that only goes so far and doesn't always ""cure"" some of these hormonal fluctuations.

We've had sex only 3 times since our baby was born. And actually, in nearly a year, because we didn't have sex for a few months leading up to the birth. I was unable to orgasm any of those times because he finished before I could and then I just felt gross so I got cleaned up and dressed. It makes me feel fat, ugly and hideous when I can't finish.

Sex is huge for me. I need that connection, that intimacy. I used to be in the adult entertainment industry, my husband knows this, he knows that I feel so uncomfortable with my body postpartum because of the changes. However, that doesn't mean I'm not sexual with him. I try to initiate a lot, I try to compliment him a lot, but he's always ""too stressed"" which is fine, I get it. He got a new position at work earlier this year and it's been incredibly stressful. Stress can make it difficult for him to perform. Because of this new job, he's missed a lot of our baby's first year, I've been alone with her and our other kid a lot.

I happened to be on his tablet to show him something. When I opened his browser, I opened a new tab and saw that he'd recently been viewing a lot of porn. It really upset me. I know he's allowed to watch that, he can do whatever he wants. But ffs, I'm here, begging to be fucked, and he's off watching porn instead of coming to me? I don't care if he uses it to get going, as long as it finishes with me. He knows, with my history in the adult entertainment field, I get very uncomfortable with porn because it's one of those ""what I was"" and ""what I am now"" things.

So now I feel like I'm unreasonably upset about this. Because I know he has needs but so do I. And I feel like he was ignoring my needs and wants and went straight to porn vs asking me to suck him off or whatever. It sounds so silly, because of all people, everyone says I should be fine with it. That I could watch porn too. Yes, I could, but there's nothing out there I enjoy - I really find my husband to be the epitome of sexual attractiveness and he's not out there filming porn. 

I'm so mad and upset with him. And because of my PPD/a, my thoughts run wild and they run to ""divorce him, you're not worthy of him"" and I hate that. He knows I'm struggling and that my brain is going to these places. That I feel horrible, ugly.

130,826,"Trying to keep it brief; apologies if this doesn't make sense I'm really in a dark place.

I had a severe bout of depression start last week. I've never experienced anything like this before in my life. Psychiatrist thinks it was triggered by a perfect storm of sleep deprivation, weaning off night time breastfeeds and underlying trauma/undiagnosed ADHD/ASD. 

I've been bed bound up until yesterday. I was nearly sectioned because I couldn't think past not wanting to be alive anymore. I've had intensive home treatment with daily visits from psychiatrist and psych nurse. I've started multiple meds. The psychiatrist basically gave my partner an ultimatum: ""keep her here under your supervision or she will have to be admitted to the hospital"". It's a lot for him; he's suddenly found himself having to run the house and care for our 3.5yo and 11mo. Work have given him paid leave. We don't want me to go into hospital. We're in the UK and past the threshold for the local MBU because my baby turns 1 in 2 weeks time. The idea of a general psych ward fills me with dread and I don't see myself getting better there

Anyway, since I've been able to get out of bed my partner keeps taking out his frustrations on me. He wanted to have a shower and said ""you need to watch the kids so I can wash"". I had literally just woken up after minimal sleep and they were both upset (a huge trugger for me right now). They'd not had breakfast, got dressed or had their teeth brushed. They were both sat in front of the TV having not had a proper breakfast just eating dry cereal from a bowl. I instantly went into a meltdown; crying and panicking to the point I nearly left the house then remembered the police would be called if I did. His response was ""what do you want me to do I need to wash?!"". I tried to explain I am just overwhelmed and he said ""how do you think I feel?!"". It's clear he's not coping and as much as I'd like to be able to snap out of this I just can't. 

He also keeps asking me questions like ""what meals shall I plan this week?"", ""can you call the bank to approve this that or the other"", ""what gift shall I take to the birthday party she is going to tomorrow"", ""what are our plans for next weekend now that you're not well"". My head is literally fried, everything he asks I start to panic and get overwhelmed because I can sense the underlying frustration in his tone.

The chaos around me of the children and the mess in the house is adding to my guilt. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm a failure as a mother and partner. They need me so much and I just can't do what I normally do right now. How can I help him understand I'm not just being lazy? This is SO unlike me and I just don't know how to communicate what I'm going through.

He's not a bad man he is struggling. We're on our knees as a family.

He’s 11 months and has been waking up like CRAZY for the past month, and it usually takes me and my husband 2 hours to put him back to sleep. Nothing we do works. It’s so fucking frustrating. 
I’m writing this after having a major rage episode with him, after 2 hours of trying to put him to bed. I screamed so much at him, said some pretty hurtful and heavy stuff, and just threw him in the crib, like I couldn’t care less.. 
I’m treating ppd for a couple of months now, and it’s been great with the medication, but as soon as he has these long night wakes I lose my shit. 
I know I’m going to feel waaaay worse tomorrow, and I’ll just cry my eyes out for doing that to him. He’s probably gonna hate me or be afraid of me.

Note: I’m reading all the comments and I’m so thankful for this community ❤️ thank you all for understanding my situation and my feelings. I’ll try to answer every comment, but I just wanted to say a couple more things:
- Me and my husband are pretty much alone, our families live in another country.. So it gets pretty hard sometimes :(
- I love the idea of cosleeping, but whenever I try my baby just gets really agitated, and he keeps looking for me on the bed (even though I’m literally right there next to him, holding his hand). I cannot tell you guys how many times he slapped me, pulled my hair, head-bumped me, and so on.. So honestly and sadly I do think he’s going to sleep better in the crib. 
- I’m treating PPD with medication but I also have ADHD, which I also take medication for.. So for me it gets really hard to control my emotions when I get overwhelmed and overstimulated. I know it’s not an excuse, it’s more about context.
- We are currently trying the “divide and conquer” approach: if baby wakes up until 3am, my husband goes, and after that it’s me.. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it just makes us more tired. But we’ll figure it out!
- the main thing is that if it comes to a point where I’m feeling the rage and frustration coming, I’ll definitely put him in the crib and walk away. I still feel like shit for what I did and said to him that day, and it’s pretty hard to forgive myself.",,"feel like absolute bad mother world not patience leave baby night

133,847,"I had my c-section a week ago, and my relationship with my husband is now stained. Maybe it’s the postpartum depression, or maybe it’s something else. It all started one day after the c-section, I was still stuck on the hospital bed and my mother in law came visit. She was holding my baby, and he started crying so my mother took him from her so I could breastfeed him. Her face dropped and my husband told me to tell my mother to let his mother mind the baby as she would only be in the country for 3 weeks. I appreciate her flying all the way here, and wanting to help and all but I just prefer my mum’s help. I was falling asleep then I overheard my husband talking to his mother saying my mom had been a great help and all but she should leave and stuff, to add to that my husband had been frosty to my dad as well, so I broke down and told my mum about that. My mum cried but she tried to calm me down as well, then left to let my mother in law mind the baby. The second day after the surgery, I broke down again because I don’t like how she treats the baby like he’s hers. She didn’t mention to him about me, she didn’t hand him back to me so I could feed him when he started crying, instead she offered him a bottle without letting me try to breastfeed him first, and also she has a cold and runny nose but not bother to wear a mask (my baby and I eventually caught it from her). I broke down and told my husband I wanted to hold my baby, he told his mom not to take it personally and that I wanted to hold my baby as I haven’t gotten to much. His mum left the room and for once there were just the baby, my husband and I in the room. After a while my husband went to check on his mum and he found her crying in the hallway. So I felt like she tried to make it about herself once again. She did that on our honeymoon as well. She decided to complain about me to my husband, saying she couldn’t get to know me, how we didn’t have deep enough conversations while I thought we were fine. After that I felt more self-conscious around her, I felt like I have to ask questions for the sake of asking questions otherwise she would go and tell my husband. I don’t hate her or anything, but we weren’t close to begin with so I just feel awkward and tense whenever she’s around, and she was around every afternoon during our hospital stay up until the last day when I had enough and just walked out of the hospital room. She then got upset and my husband blamed me saying I was being rude and so on. And he went back home with his mum that night. I just felt like he always put his mum first, even before checking into the hospital, he kept asking me whether he has to sleep at the hospital with me, he said he worried how his mum was going to get food and stuff as she was/is staying in our house (i already taught her how to use food ordering app). The next day my husband came back to the hospital just before we checked out, we had a talk and I told him how I felt around his mum. He said I was being a nightmare and I should grow up. We got back home and his mum decided to check herself into a hotel, and my husband said it’s because of me. I decided it would be better for me to go to my hometown for a while as I felt depressed, sleep deprived and I just need my mum’s help. I told him that and we had another talk, and this time it really changed the way I feel towards him. I told him I can’t do this alone, and that I need my support system. He said I’m incapable and that he’s disappointed in me. He said now that the baby’s here, I have to clean the house, mind the baby, cook him food and so on. His voice was cold when he said that, like he’s a different person. I asked him how does he expect me to do everything when my stitches weren’t even fully heal and that I’m sleep deprived, he said he doesn’t care and it’s my job, which I know it’s my job and I have no problem doing that, but hearing that from his mouth really took me by surprise. I said I felt like he has changed and he said he had put up with my mood swings for 9 months during the pregnancy, and now he expected me to stop having mood swings and step up. He said him being nice to me got him nothing, and that I was being ungrateful to him by not cooking food the last while, which I wasn’t aware of as whenever I asked him what he wanted for food, he always said it’s okay and that he wanted me to relax instead of cooking. And he complained that I changed a lot since I got pregnant, how I didn’t go to social events with him anymore, in my defence, I gained a lot of weight and didn’t want to be seen, he understood back then and said it’s okay but now he claimed it’s an issue. It’s been a few days now since we had that talk, he eventually agreed to let me go to my hometown with my mum next week and he’s been trying to act as caring as before as both our moms are still here in the house with us, but I can’t get over what he said. Also I feel like his feeling for me is different now. Like he only asked about our baby, how’s the baby, and nothing about me. He used to kiss me goodbye before work everyday and now there’s nothing. I feel like I’m just a baby sitter in my own house. Not the postpartum experience I thought we would have. I’m afraid this is the end of us.

They’ll be here until December (the tickets are already booked), but honestly, I don’t know how I’m going to survive until then.

I just had my first baby, and instead of feeling supported and loved, I feel like I’m drowning in judgment and negativity, especially from my mom. During pregnancy, she constantly accused me of betraying my family and being selfish, all because I wasn’t bending over backward for people who never even cared about me. She doesn’t like my husband—she never has. Where we’re from, love marriages are still frowned upon, and because my husband isn’t some rich, fair-skinned guy, she can’t stand him. It’s like no matter how good he is to me, she can’t see past her outdated ideals.

She stressed me out so much during pregnancy, and I feel like it’s happening all over again now that I’m postpartum. It’s like she can’t stand to see my husband helping me. She makes these snide comments and gets angry when he’s by my side, even though he’s just trying to take care of me and the baby. My sibling, who’s been staying with us and paying rent, isn’t much better. They don’t like my husband either. It’s this constant tension in the house, and they’re always upset when my husband’s parents want to check in on us or see their grandchild. It’s their first grandchild, and they just want to be involved, but every time they call, my mom and sibling give me this disapproving look.

The worst part was during delivery. It was so rough—at one point, the doctors were trying to save me and the baby, and my husband was scared. He needed support, so he called his family to keep them updated, which is completely understandable. But as soon as I was moved to my room, my mom found a way to make it about her. She told me she didn’t like how my in-laws were being “updated” about the situation. I mean, I had just given birth—my life and my baby’s life had been at risk, and all she could think about was how she didn’t like that my husband called his parents? I was too exhausted to fight with her, but it hurt.

It’s the same story every day. My in-laws call to check on me and the baby because they care, and every time, my mom gets upset. She even told me once that she feels like they’re “keeping an eye on her,” like this is some sort of power play. I’ve tried telling her over and over that no one is watching her, no one cares what she’s doing—they just want to see their grandchild! But she keeps making me feel like I’m in the middle of some tug-of-war, and it’s exhausting.

To make things worse, after we came home from the hospital, my husband started sleeping in the same room as me to help with the baby at night. We were both so tired, emotionally and physically drained from everything. But my mom came in and told us she didn’t like it. She said we shouldn’t act like a couple anymore, that our life has changed, and we’re supposed to be different now. I just couldn’t believe it—after everything we’d been through, she still finds ways to criticize us.

I’m so overwhelmed. I know I can’t ask them to leave because their tickets are booked for another two months, but I don’t know how I’m going to survive this. Every day feels like I’m being judged for trying to live my life, for loving my husband, for just trying to recover from everything. I can’t even enjoy being a mom because all of this is weighing me down so much. I don’t know what to do anymore—I just feel so alone in this.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to comment and support. I appreciate it more than you know. Right now, I just need to feel like someone understands what I’m going through.",,"hello angel earth

139,876,"Several months ago, I shared a lengthy post detailing my family's struggles with my wife's severe post-partum depression. In the time since, things have around the home only continued to deteriorate. After months of advocacy, I finally managed to get her to agree to attend weekly couples' counseling sessions with me. In between our second and third sessions, she hit me with the, ""I love you, but I’m not sure I still feel like I’m *in* love with you,"" and has since told me she doesn't feel like our marriage is worth saving.

She says things that are utterly detached from reality, things that baffle me in ways that are difficult to describe. She says she feels like she's left to do ""everything"" for our children on her own, but we've paid for full-time childcare (in addition to the support I provide) this whole time. She told our therapist I'm ""never there,"" but I work from home and rarely leave the house. She says she feels like she's ""on her own"" around the house, but I'm the one who does all the cooking, all the grocery shopping, most of the dishes, and most of the laundry. We probably split baths and diaper changes and the like for our kids 50/50. I also handle literally *every* administrative task for our household. When I try to remind her of these facts, she gets agitated and confrontational. I'm a doting and attentive father, and I regularly argue with her to get her *permission* to take them places with me. She's also spent significant time away (1-2 weeks at a time) from the family on multiple occasions. I have never done this.

She threatened to leave me when our first child was younger as well. I came home one day to a detailed custody plan and separation agreement just sitting on the table. So, in that sense, I've seen this before. On the other hand, though, there's something different about the exchange this time around. There's a finality that emanates throughout her words when she says it this time around, and I feel like I'm less effective at breaking through the fog the second time around. Likewise, when I try to stress to her that what she's saying isn't reflective of the lives we lead, it does not go over well at all, to say the very least.

Compounding matters, she's gone through a series of different therapists in recent months. Each one has offered a different diagnosis and, consequently, recommended a different medication. I'm sure these changes aren't helping. Moreover, whenever I express any interest in fostering her mental health, she responds with bitterness and scorn.

In truth, if it weren't for my children (3 1/2 and 1 1/2), I'd have left her a long time ago. I do my best to intervene when she's unfairly cross or contemptuous towards them, but it's clearly an unsustainable goal -- both because it weighs heavily on my own heart and because I can't always be around. 

In the past, she has punched me and shaken our older child in frustration. Each occurred only once, but I imagine that, if the shoe were on the other foot, once would be enough. When she shook our child, I was able to step in almost immediately to put a stop to it. I know that such actions are indefensible -- PPD or no. If we separate, though, it will be an incredibly high bar to reach for me as a father to be awarded full custody of our kids, and I fear what could happen on those occasions when I'm not literally in the next room.

I have never felt more hopeless or helpless. I cry almost daily. I'm cognizant of the example we're setting for our children when it comes to how one should speak to people they love, and I fear the dysfunction that pervades our daily lives has impacted their development. Our older child is still not fully potty trained at 3 1/2, and our younger child still does not walk at 17 months.

I'm worn down. I'm not firing on all cylinders after spending years on end in full-on crisis mode. Leaving my wife would be the best thing for me as an individual, there's no question. But I genuinely fear what would/could happen to my children if I did. For that reason, pursuing divorce at this point strikes me as selfish and would make me a bad father. Still, my children deserve better than what they're getting/seeing/living on a daily basis, just as I deserve a partner capable of love and compassion and affection.

I don't know if I'm requesting advice or commiseration or reassurance from this group. Maybe I'm just hoping to unburden myself.

Well I’ve been struggling with ppd/ppa & other struggles but I never thought it would be this hard I’ve always had anxiety & depression as an adolescent but it was different then my symptoms now. For a minute I was so proud I made it to 4 months of postpartum without signs of ppa/ppd. Soon afterwards I had my first intrusive thought & it was distressing truly & from there I spiraled into a million different scenarios that cause me panic. I have processed most by doing CBT & I know they will never happen. I still can’t seem to get passed the guilt & my mind tries to villainize everything I do even towards my family members & my morals. I believe it’s my brains way of trying to tear me down trying to have me feel like a piece of crap.

I have the baby by myself until around 6pm when my husband gets home and then I spend that time making dinner and getting my oldest ready for bed. Once the baby goes down at 8/9pm, he sleeps until 11/12 and is awake again at 3am.

151,941,I have been struggling horribly with PPD and PPA since y second week of giving birth. I have had 2 therapy sessions and they basically tried to downplay my feelings. I told my on and he said he can’t extend my SDI that my psychiatrist has to do it.I tried getting help from my regular primary care and she said to make an apt with psychiatrist. problem is I’m supposed to go to work next week and I don’t think I can’t do it mentally and physically. My apt with psychiatrist is not until after my start date. Do you have any recommendations on what to do in my case. I’m seeking therapy and they will start meds but I do not feel stable enough to go back to work yet.,,struggle horribly ppd ppa since second week give birth therapy session basically try downplay feeling tell say can not extend sdi psychiatrist iti try get help regular primary care say make apt psychiatrist problem suppose go work next week not think can not mentally physically apt psychiatrist start date recommendation case seek therapy start med feel stable enough go back work yet,2,0.46469963,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
152,950,"Hey all, I’m a new dad to a beautiful baby girl who I am over the moon for. She is my world and I love her dearly. Unfortunately, my wife has been struggling hard with postpartum depression and it is really bad. All through her pregnancy she was excited to be a mother especially to a baby girl. The week we brought our daughter home she flipped. She told me she didn’t want to do this anymore and that she didn’t want her. We both knew it was PPD so we spoke to her doctor and she is now on anti depressants. 

Since being on her antidepressants, nothing has changed. She has verbally stated she wanted to un-alive herself which ended up getting her placed in a medical facility for 7 days. She was released and it didn’t help. 

Overall, my daughter is 6 weeks old and I have been fighting to be the supportive husband that my wife and daughter both need. We have been leaning on family for support and due to how bad my wife has it we are moving to be closer to family so they can help her while I can go back to work and make money. 

This is already a long post so I did not go in to detail regarding all of my wife’s actions while dealing with her PPD. My question is, are there any fathers who went through this? How long will it last? Are we making the right decision to move closer to family? What can I do to help my wife? (I already take care of our daughter almost entirely alone. Some days my wife is feeling okay and helps but those days don’t last long). 

Also, my wife wants time away from the baby. She believes that will help her get through this. She said she wants a month away without taking care of her. I almost feel she needs that but is it smart to do? It won’t be easy on me and I’ll be leaning on family if that happened but I’m running out of options. I don’t know how to help my wife meet her needs while also making sure I can make money AND care for our daughter. What can I do?",,"hey new dad beautiful baby girl moon world love dearly unfortunately wife struggle hard postpartum depression really bad pregnancy excited mother especially baby girl week bring daughter home flip tell not want anymore not want know ppd speak doctor anti depressant

153,953,"PPD sucks. I’m overwhelmed by everything. Even on meds. I feel like my house is disgusting. I’m so embarrassed by it. It makes me hate being home. Everything keeps piling up. The laundry, the dishes, the baby clothes, the toys, the mess. I can’t seem to keep up with it. 

Im alone. I stay home M-f. Work the the weekends. I’m an exclusive pumper. So I pump every 2 hours around the clock, and I make just enough to feed my daughter. She’s 6m so starting to need to be entertained and it’s getting hard to pump when I’m solo at home. I feel like I can’t get anything done. And my house disgust me. I hate everything. It makes me SO angry that the constant mess doesn’t bother my husband. I can’t even tell you the last time I’ve been able to clean our bathroom. I have no help. The clutter and grossness to me increases by day. I want to mop, I want to open my curtains to let the light in. I want my house to smell like fresh laundry. But in reality I have 4 baskets of clean clothes that need to be folded. 
Dishes that smell on my counter, dirty clothes on my kitchen table. And I’m overwhelmed.
Where is the village that’s supposed to help?
I feel so alone. I feel like I have no one to help me. If I’m not pumping I’m trying to clean, if I have time to. My daughter wants constant attention, and only naps for 45min-hour non contact. I hate that our gross house doesn’t bother my husband. Why he can’t see a mess and just want to clean it. Instead he wants a list of where to start and what to clean.
I’m drowning.",,"ppd suck overwhelmed everything even med feel like house disgusting embarrassed make hate home everything keep pile laundry dish baby clothe toy mess can not seem keep
