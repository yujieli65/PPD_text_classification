171,"I've been really struggling this first week and I feel like I just need someone to tell me it gets better and I won't feel broken forever...

For context, I'm 31 and this is my first baby. I've wanted to be a mom my whole life and was so, so excited while I was pregnant. Then I had our sweet girl 5 weeks early and she spent a whole month in the NICU. I thought that was going to be the hardest part, leaving our girl with strangers everyday but now that she's home it's been SO SO hard.

Since I'm off work and my husband isn't I thought I could do the nights mostly on my own and I was managing even though she was waking up every 90 mins for food and I have to pump because she won't breastfeed.
But now we're a week in and she has a stomach bug AND thrush in her mouth. She's waking up like every hour and sometimes she won't sleep unless you're holding her so my husband and I are taking 3 hours shifts so we both get some sleep (and he's taking a few hours off each day so he can catch up on sleep before work).

I love my girl more than anything but taking care of her 24/7 makes me feel like less than a person and more of a milking cow. And I don't want my husband to resent me, I don't think he does or will it's just one of those PPD thoughts - even though we agreed on one child early on in our relationship I know he didn't really want kids. What if he ends up hating me because of this? Because of all the extra work for ""no reward"" for him. I at least have moments of love and joy with her but I'm not sure he does.

Thank you for reading, it's a lot and I'm just at a loss on where to go from here and what to do. I feel like I'm failing my daughter, my husband, and myself and that's the hardest part. I also have a great support system around me that I lean on but no one's really struggled like this (that I know of) and Im just looking for a little reassurance that it does get better. That one day I'll feel like a person again, I'll get to sleep more than 30 minutes at a time, that my husband and I can be a couple again, and that I won't wish anyone else could just take my girl off my hands until it's not so dang hard...",,"really struggle first week feel like need someone tell get well will not feel broken forever

I created a Discord community for moms in all stages of the postpartum journey—whether you’re 6 weeks in or 6 years—and I’d love for you to join us.

This isn’t just another group; it’s a safe space where we can talk about the hard stuff: mental health, the postpartum experience, and the realities that don’t make it into the parenting books. It’s a place to vent, seek advice, join weekly/monthly mental health activities, and find genuine support from people who get it.

Postpartum mental health is often overlooked, and too many of us suffer in silence. Let’s change that. Together, we can create a village that uplifts and supports each other.

*""Under good conditions, the (premenstrual) luteal phase of the monthly cycle resembles pregnancy, as a period of progesterone dominance, in which the abundance of progesterone causes cells to decrease their estrogen content. The luteal phase is actually the first stage of pregnancy,*

*The sudden decrease of progesterone production before menstruation is similar to decrease of hormone production just before childbirth. The same conditions that produce the premenstrual syndrome, if they aren't corrected by the placenta's massive production of progesterone, will produce preeclampsia, toxemia of pregnancy, eclampsia, and postpartum depression. They are also related to the problems that become so common at menopause.*  
*Whenever the production of progesterone falls, tissues are susceptible to estrogen. There are several common causes of a progesterone deficiency. Deficiencies of thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol are often responsible for a progesterone deficiency. Inadequate light exposure can cause it. Excess polyunsaturated fats, interfering with gonads and thyroid, can cause it. And excess serotonin can cause it""* [https://wiki.chadnet.org/files/postpartum-prementstrual-and-seasonal-seotonin-soaks.pdf](https://wiki.chadnet.org/files/postpartum-prementstrual-and-seasonal-seotonin-soaks.pdf)

I hope it’s okay to share this here—I’m a third-year film production university student currently producing my graduate short film, *Matrescence*. The film tells the story of a new mother struggling with postnatal depression, and our goal is to raise awareness and help break the silence and stigma around this incredibly important issue.

We’ve spent a lot of time researching and consulting to ensure we tell this story authentically and with care. Our team feels so strongly about shedding light on this subject, especially as it’s something that many mothers experience but often feel unable to talk about.

We’re currently crowdfunding to help make the film a reality, and if anyone is interested, you can read more about our project [here](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/matrescence). Even if donating isn’t something you’re able to do, sharing the campaign or offering feedback would mean the world to us.

I posted here about 2 months ago, I was not doing well at all and since then I've been trying to get better, got on meds, went to the hospital for a week, was put on sick leave (I'm still not back a 100%) and well it got a bit better until it didn't..

I was the sole provider of the household but my husband got a job offer a few days ago, the problem with it is that it's shift work.. meaning I will be by myself to take care of our daughter most of the time now. I cannot sleep when I'm taking care of her. Like right now she's asleep next to me but I didn't sleep a wink. I don't know how I'm supposed to be taking care of her by myself (and go to work myself)... The thing is my husband struggled really hard to find this job so it's not like I can tell him to refuse it because it's also very hard for me to be the sole provider so there's no good compromise.

So now, I just don't know how I'm supposed to survive, I feel like it doesn't get better and I have no choice but to put my feelings aside and take care of everything. And I can't. I'm so freaking tired of it all, I feel like I can't breathe.. I realise that I'm kinda preparing to die, like I'm soaking it in when I'm holding my daughter or when she wraps her little fingers around mine, I've been telling her I'm sorry, I've been researching how I could proceed etc. I talked about it with my husband, I told him that I wanted to die and I think he doesn't know what to do but I don't either.

I don't really know what I'm expecting out of this post, I guess I just want to feel like someone understands what I'm going through ",,"tw suicide

504,"Hi all, new to this sub and new to parenting. FTM 28. 

I dont know if I have pp rage, depression, or anxiety or a fun combo of all three but I feel like I’m drowning. I do have a history of mental illness, mainly depression and anxiety led by my bipolar disorder but I haven’t felt like this in years. I would also like to preface, I love my husband he is a good man. So if you feel the need just keep it to constructive criticism. 

I’m struggling really hard with being a mom, I love my daughter ( a month today!) I never even thought I could get pregnant, but I am exhausted, touched out and at my wits end. When she’s not using me for a pacifier, she’s eating, then sleeps for a short period before waking up absolutely pissed about any number of things. Hungry, gassy, just wants to be held, a dirty diaper (which she’s even more pissed to be changed, don’t really get that but okay). she is a fairly good baby, I definitely wouldn’t classify her as colicky, she just is a well a newborn baby. But I also can’t get anything done, right now in the main caregiver as I’m EBF and my husband works full time as we discussed me taking a full 3 month maternity leave. It’s also RSV season so I’m isolated at home, I’m sick of looking at the same 8 walls (bedroom and living room) everyday. My poor animals are getting neglected as by the time that they actually want attention I’m so sleep deprived or touched out that I just want them away from me. I feel horrible because they just look at me like I broke their hearts. I’ve been having issues with my supply, it was my fault I wasn’t being consistent because I was desperately sleep deprived and my bipolar is really bad idk I don’t get sleep, so I’ve become angry and defensive over that. I literally cried over spilled breast milk last night because it was the last 3 oz in the fridge and I was just done being touched for a little bit but then had to feed her anyways because I spilled it. I’ve been having severe upper back pain that’s ruining this stage for me. I don’t wanna hold my daughter because it makes the pain 10x worse. So instead of enjoying my newborn snuggles I can’t wait to get her off me. Which in turn makes me feel so guilty, because I haven’t enjoyed any of it. I didn’t enjoy pregnancy because I was sick or in miserable pain the entire time and now I’m not able to find the joy in being a mom. Don’t get me wrong I have my moments where she’s off me and calm and I’m so overloaded with joy I just cry because I love her so much and I’m so happy, but the times I’m not make me feel so bad. 

My husband helps when he can, he’s totally down to go to work sleep deprived so he can stay up and settle the baby, or feed her if I have milk pumped. Anything with the baby he’s all in for, but he’s stopped caring to take care of me. I know I’m a big girl and I can care for myself, but I’m so busy caring for another human I don’t think about me other than survival. Eat, drink water, pp care, sleep. Sometimes I’m not even eating because I can’t get to the kitchen to make myself something because I have a baby attached to my chest or who refuses to be put down and all the food we have has to be cooked in some form. If I want something from him I have to ask. Which I guess is fine? He will do anything I ask with out hesitation, but sometimes I just don’t want to expend the mental effort to ask him to do things. I just want him to see the need and fulfill it. We’ve got boxes and trash piled by our front door because he won’t walk it to the dumpster, dishes that need to be done, a dishwasher that desperately needs a clean because it smells like death??? I’d like him to get up and want to make me breakfast because I’ve explained 65 times that I need it (this was an issue over pregnancy as well and he wouldn’t make me something till I was physically ill every morning). I want him to want to sweep, mop, and vacuum the floors, pick up after himself to not add to the mess, ask about me and how I’m feeling, offer to rub my back before I complain or am in tears, just simple things. I don’t want to have to ask for every little thing. He knows this as we’ve discussed it, and I feel bad for putting so much on him, but I just need him to take care of things so I can focus on the baby and myself. It’s just me and him. My mother lives 2-3 hours away and we are for the most part estranged, and my mil while only 40 minutes away is sometimes overbearing, sweet as can be and her and my FIL  have done so much to help, I just don’t want to sit with them while they coo over the baby. I feel so horrible that I’ve become this mean rage filled person in my relationship, but I don’t feel good. I’m tired of being asked stupid obvious questions by my husband who’s just unobservant, I’m tired of asking for every little thing, I’m tired of being tired, I’m tired of being home 24/7, I’m tired of the acne, feeling ugly and being frustrated by my husband loving on me and trying to make me feel attractive by making out with me, because it just reminds me that I have maybe another month of recovery before I can do anything sexual with him. I don’t want to tell him he can’t do things he enjoys to unwind from work or be his own person, but I feel totally alone and I want him to want to not do anything else. He’s a gaming YouTuber so he often plays games or is recording or editing a video if he has any true free time. 

I feel guilty that I have a mental health disorder that requires sleep for me to be able to manage it well and I can’t sleep because I have to take care of her. I feel guilty that I’m not enjoying this as much as I should, that I haven’t enjoyed ANY part of my pregnancy or postpartum at all. I feel guilty that I don’t enjoy breastfeeding. I feel guilty and like a failure I tapped out during labor. I feel like a failure and guilty because her rooms not even done. I cry at some point in the night every night and sob because I feel so bad about so many things. I just feel horrible and now I’m pissed off all the time too. 

Sorry this was so long I just needed to rant maybe to people who would understand. Because no one in my life I can talk to would get this. Any advice? Anyone in solidarity? Or have i completely gone insane and I’m just a bad mom and wife? Help. ",,"hi new sub new parenting ftm

A bit of background, I was constantly stressed during my postpartum on whether I was being a good mother and wanted to follow wake windows. This caused me super depressed and stressed all the time. Now I am better. 

Well now, My friend, FTM, she is expecting and is currently at around 8 months. So I told my friend that it is not all fun and exciting because I always had the feeling that I would have prepared myself if someone has said this to me. But her response hurt me a lot. 

She said her close friend did not have the depression and managed it well and depends on people. She says it really is how well you could have managed it. She also said to stop bringing negativity to her and she will ask if she needs counselling. I was hurt when I tried to make her ready for what’s coming and all I got in return is that I did not manage it well. 

Now, I feel I am overreacting and constantly asking myself whether I was showing my weak self towards my baby. I am questioning myself “Did I not manage it well? Am I doing something wrong in telling people the actual reality?” I think this lingering feeling will never go away now. 

Edit: Reading all your comments has been incredibly reassuring. It reminds me that I’m not alone in this postpartum journey, and it’s comforting to know that the challenges I’m facing are shared by others. It makes me happy to realize that I’ve been doing my best, and there’s nothing I could have done differently to change the situation. 

I also realize now that I shouldn’t have initiated the conversation with my friend until she was ready to approach me herself. I didn’t consider how overwhelming or scary it might have been for her from her perspective. Thank you for helping me see things more clearly.",,"

This question is mainly for the moms. Does anyone else feel uneasy at the idea of your children being left alone with male relatives. For whatever reason I don't feel comfortable with my son being left with alone with any of his 4 grandfather's. I'm constantly watching their every move. FYI I don't have a history of childhood trauma. I do however have postpartum anxiety/depression.

On January 22 2024 I was 7 months pregnant, I had hyperemesis gravidarum and was struggling to work, constantly nauseous and throwing up 6 times a day. I could barely eat, and missed a lot of work hurting me financially. My baby stopped moving while I was at work. He was stillborn at my job 2 days later on 1/24/24. I was completely broken as a person after my son died. A part of me died in the delivery room with him that day. I was horrified and traumatized. My pregnancy had been healthy outside of the hyperemesis and baby had checked out totally fine on ultrasound and tests. I got pregnant again very quickly, about 6 weeks after my son was stillborn. This pregnancy I had hypermesis again. It was even worse. I was throwing up 20 times a day. I ended up on a continuous medication pump as well as IV fluids. I had to take unpaid medical leave from work. Thank god I had short time disability, it only pays at 60%. Once again I suffered financially. This time I was out of work for almost my entire pregnancy. I tried to go back to work at 25 weeks but was violently ill at work. Constantly in the bathroom throwing up and throwing up in patient rooms. My anxiety during this pregnancy was horrendous. I worried constantly that this baby would die too. I was so sick and depressed and isolated. All I could do was lay in bed, throw up and cry. My dogs took care of me while my partner worked overtime trying to help us financially. I lost my health insurance. We struggled to put food on the table. My baby was born early at 36 weeks last week. She is beautiful and perfect and alive and I’m so relieved. The hyperemesis went away as soon as she was born, I was so relieved. I got discharged from the hospital. First day was happy and joyful. The next morning my car was repossessed. The financial  struggles continue, I have no money. My savings are long gone. The depression hit along with the hormone drop. On day 3 I had nightmares so horrible. I dreamed about my son being born dead over and over. I dreamed my daughter was born dead too. I woke up screaming and crying. I’m still too afraid to sleep. I feel so overwhelmed and depressed. I have been thinking about suicide constantly. I did this while I was sick too. It’s just this constant thought, what a relief from all the financial hardship it would be. I feel so guilty for thinking this way. I should be grateful my rainbow baby is here safely, but I just feel so depressed and sad. I feel so crazy and anxious inside. I just want to feel like myself again. i need support. Please tell me everything will be ok. Please tell me I will survive this too.

She lied about the cheating when he asked so they went to marriage counseling….and she lied about the cheating in marriage counseling. She finally confessed to the cheating on their fifth year wedding anniversary and blamed it on postpartum depression. He went into a dark place during this time, stated that the cheating broke something inside of him and that he was embarrassed to be cheated on.

871,"I had a VERY traumatic pregnancy and urgent csection. Long story short, I was pregnant with mono-mono twins. One had a lethal brain condition and their cords were entangled the entire pregnancy. 

Our one baby girl passed away at 28 weeks therefore I had to have an urgent c-section. Our surviving twin  spent 102 days in 3 different hospital, 2 NICUs and 1 rehab.

I suffered with anxiety my whole life but when our one passed away, I was completely broken. (I forever will be) When our baby came home. I whole different type of depression hit. I thought ALL day of not wanting to be on this planet. I felt like everyone would be better off if I was not here. I would spend my days looking up postpartum depression stories and I came across one story of a woman who did not survive PPD. At that very moment, I felt like that was going to be my end. 

The next day, I called my husband and told him I needed to go to the hospital NOW. He came home and my mom took me to the hospital. Thankfully, although I had an awful ER experience, I had a wonderful stay. I was put on a medication better suited for me. I also stopped pumping. Let me tell you, sleep deprivation and not eating and having a baby with medical needs was terrifying.

After a 7 day stay, I went home. I was scared to be out of the hospital but I joined an IOP program and spent 11 hrs a week doing intensive therapy. I did this from April till July while working full time at home and taking care of our baby. Over time, I started feeling better. Its been almost 10 months and I feel like a new person. I enjoy going out, I even try to go out as much as possible. I enjoy seeing our baby look at the world. I enjoy the world. If you are in the thick of it, know that I was as well. I did not think I would survive. Here I am...surviving and loving life. Everyday is NOT perfect. I still have anxiety, but I am in a much better place.

872,"So my life before my son (10 mo. Old) was really crappy. I was in a bad situation right as I turned 18 and I never “learned” who I am or even how to adult. I got pregnant against my will and forced to keep him. I love my son more than anything but I feel like i don’t know who I am. I’m having a lot of emotional breakdowns because of it.

925,"Hi everyone,

Posting this again :) After giving birth, I realized there was a huge gap in pp support for mothers. I went through an unplanned C-section, birth trauma, and postpartum preeclampsia, and I remember searching for a space where I could connect with other moms in real-time, but I often found forums lacking that immediate, comforting connection.

I decided to create a pp community in Discord to help bridge this gap. I am not trying to sound gimmicky. I am determined to create a safe, informative, supportive community, in real-time for pp mothers. For those unfamiliar w/ Discord, it provides real-time connection, organized spaces, and event hosting (which I plan on doing once it grows - think webinars with specialists in all different postpartum fields), among other cool capabilities. I would be honored if you would join!
