171,"I've been really struggling this first week and I feel like I just need someone to tell me it gets better and I won't feel broken forever...

For context, I'm 31 and this is my first baby. I've wanted to be a mom my whole life and was so, so excited while I was pregnant. Then I had our sweet girl 5 weeks early and she spent a whole month in the NICU. I thought that was going to be the hardest part, leaving our girl with strangers everyday but now that she's home it's been SO SO hard.

Since I'm off work and my husband isn't I thought I could do the nights mostly on my own and I was managing even though she was waking up every 90 mins for food and I have to pump because she won't breastfeed.
But now we're a week in and she has a stomach bug AND thrush in her mouth. She's waking up like every hour and sometimes she won't sleep unless you're holding her so my husband and I are taking 3 hours shifts so we both get some sleep (and he's taking a few hours off each day so he can catch up on sleep before work).

I love my girl more than anything but taking care of her 24/7 makes me feel like less than a person and more of a milking cow. And I don't want my husband to resent me, I don't think he does or will it's just one of those PPD thoughts - even though we agreed on one child early on in our relationship I know he didn't really want kids. What if he ends up hating me because of this? Because of all the extra work for ""no reward"" for him. I at least have moments of love and joy with her but I'm not sure he does.

Thank you for reading, it's a lot and I'm just at a loss on where to go from here and what to do. I feel like I'm failing my daughter, my husband, and myself and that's the hardest part. I also have a great support system around me that I lean on but no one's really struggled like this (that I know of) and Im just looking for a little reassurance that it does get better. That one day I'll feel like a person again, I'll get to sleep more than 30 minutes at a time, that my husband and I can be a couple again, and that I won't wish anyone else could just take my girl off my hands until it's not so dang hard...",,"really struggle first week feel like need someone tell get well will not feel broken forever

176,"Hey all! A few months ago I had posted here asking if anyone had any experiences with Zurzuvae. I had previously had PPD with my first baby and just had my second baby 3 weeks ago with an 18 month age gap. I also had no prior history of depression before getting PPD. I wanted to share my experience since it’s a fairly new drug and there wasn’t a whole lot of info out there when I started looking into it.

I was able to get a prior authorization from my insurance to cover the Zurzuvae so I did have the actual prescription filled before I gave birth and only paid a $5 copay. If I didn’t have insurance it would’ve been upwards of $20,000. I started taking it the day I came home from the hospital (less than 48 hours after giving birth).

Overall I immediately felt better after giving birth the second time than the first time around. Deliveries were both vaginal and generally pretty easy (including postpartum recovery). With my first the hormone drop was IMMEDIATE and I remember feeling weepy/sad literally the second she came out. This time around, even without taking the Zurzuvae yet, I felt way better and really experienced that “newborn bliss” everyone talks about. I’m 3 weeks pp and still feeling completely normal aside from a couple of random crying episodes (but honestly I attribute it to normal postpartum hormonal changes because they were so minor).

While taking the Zurzuvae I didn’t experience any of the side effects people talked about on this sub- especially the tiredness. The only tiredness I really felt was normal newborn tired. I never really worried about the “eat something really fatty before taking” and aside from a little dizziness here and there had no side effects whatsoever.

It’s hard to know for sure if the Zurzuvae kept the PPD away or if I just got lucky with the hormonal balance this time around, but either way if you can take it I’d recommend it- my personal opinion is that it won’t hurt to try!

Also last thing to note- throughout my pregnancy and even now through postpartum I took/am taking a few vitamin supplements on top of my prenatals— iron, B6, D3. I started taking the B6 and D3 around 24 weeks pregnant and the iron around 32ish weeks pregnant. I’ve continued to take these postpartum and will continue to do so for 6 months (it took around 6 months for me to battle through the PPD last time). Obviously talk to your medical professional but I have a sneaking suspicion these supplements actually helped me keep the PPD at bay this time around. I’m not a doctor, this is purely an uneducated gut feeling �

tldr Took Zurzuvae immediately after birth of my 2nd; no side effects and no PPD 3wks pp. Unsure if it was the Zurzuvae that helped or I just got lucky this time around.",,"hey month ago post ask anyone experience zurzuvae previously ppd first baby second baby   week ago   month age gap also prior history depression get ppd want share experience since fairly new drug not whole lot info start look

178,"Few weeks ago after DCF was investigating my family, a detective called and told me I have to come and talk to him or get an attorney to speak with him. I told him I'm definitely not speaking with him but will try and find someone to talk to him. Obviously that was a fail and not many attorneys got back to me. I was in the middle of moving so I also kind of forgot about it especially because I was moving along with DCF and doing visitations etc with my sons. He called again today and said because I didn't get someone to speak with him he had to move on with his ""investigation"" and he sent it to the prosecutor. Now I am being charged with 2 counts risk of injury to a minor and 2 counts assault third degree. This is all due to unexplained markings to my twins during a postpartum depression/psychosis episode.

I’m hoping to get these charges dropped but I am devastated. No prior record, I worked as a toddler teacher for 6 years, no issues and then I fell pregnant. I was also a part time nanny and then my sons were born premature. I had lost my job because my leave ran out and my sons were only 4 lbs when they came home. But one was medically complex so I devoted my time and savings to be at home. I am also a single parent. DCF was already involved before the detective stepped in. My plan with DCF is reunification and my mom has temporary physical custody of my boys. They asked me about my mental health one time after my sons were born and that was that. The detective when he called suggested I come in today to “turn myself in”. He stated the judge granted my bond PTA, as in “promise to appear”. So, he claims, as long as I show up to fingerprint and mugshot etc, and then show up to court I shouldn’t have issues with bond. Over the phone he made it seem like the judge was being too nice given the charges. It hurt, because he is a man and I don’t expect him to understand the severity of this mental illness. I’m hoping the judge shows more compassion when I’m actually in court. I plan on getting a court appointed attorney as well. Notes: When my sons were getting evaluated by the hospital, I checked myself in the hospital voluntarily because I was afraid that I did do something without the knowledge. I am now on two different medications and have been actively seeing the psychiatrist, I saw my therapist since my sons were in the NICU. My sons have had regular doctors appointments sometimes twice a week others once every week since they got home. They have seen every mandated reporter since they were born, and there has been no worries up until their physical therapist called at their daycare session early January. They also attend daycare regularly unless they have their 5 million doctors visits. Unfortunately My memory of the incident is consistent with postpartum-related dissociation and/or severe depression symptoms. At first I was angry at being accused but now I feel like I'm glad it happened because I would've never known. Any advice or just words of encouragement is appreciated.",,"week ago dcf investigate family detective call tell come talk get attorney speak tell definitely speak try find someone talk obviously fail many attorney get back middle move also kind forgot especially move along dcf visitation etc son call today say not get someone speak move investigation send prosecutor charge   count risk injury minor   count assault third degree due unexplained marking twin postpartum depressionpsychosis episode

Being stuck at home 24/7 alone with the baby is catching up to me. Don’t get me wrong, I am SO happy to be home with my baby but it’s not easy. I’ve worked since the moment I could drive and have never relied on anyone. I’ve always been super independent. My fiancé is amazing and very supportive, but somethings he gets to do I don’t find very fair. He works two jobs M-F 8am-11pm sometimes earlier sometimes later. His second job is where we met. We were coworkers. A lot of our friends are coworkers from that job. On occasion he calls me and tells me he is going out for drinks with them. I understand he needs time too and I know he should be able to do that without me getting upset. But damn it’s not fair that I can’t just say “going out for drinks be home soon”. I can’t even go to the freaking grocery store when I want because we only have one car right now. So when I say I’m home all week alone. I mean it. No trips to target. Nothing. I don’t want to be the nagging partner but I can’t wait for him to get home in the evenings so I can have someone to talk to.

My husband and I experienced some steep lows before successfully conceiving - I still couldn’t believe I was pregnant until he was placed on my belly. And even then, he was immediately whisked away for care and a (thankfully) brief stay in the NICU. The room was swarmed with medical staff for him and my husband stuck with him, and while it turned out okay, I felt so devastated thinking we wouldn’t ever get to bring him home. 

I’m terrified to let my dog anywhere near him - we use a gate to separate them but I keep having intense visions of him jumping it and biting off his little leg. My dog has not shown aggression, is never alone or close to him, and likes babies, so I understand this is irrational. SIDS is also a concern of mine and I’m finding it hard to sleep (when I briefly can). Or when I walk through doorways holding my baby I’m convinced I’m going to accidentally hit his head on the frame and kill him so I walk through sideways with my hand on his head. The list goes on.

199,So I’m currently 7 months pp and I feel so alone in this new parenting journey. My husband doesn’t help me with the baby. I have to constantly ask him “can you change his diapers” or “can you watch him so I can shower or eat”. We’ve already had a conversation about this. Hes told me that he feels like he doesn’t help me as much as he should. I basically told him that he needs to see what works best for him but he can’t find it if he doesn’t take that first step. Sad to say he still hasn’t changed. Another thing is that my baby is now a Velcro baby. He always wants to be with me so I can’t really have any alone time to myself or I have to eat fast or shower fast. Since I’m a SAHM I’m just at home all day. The longest I stayed in the house was for 6 consecutive days and I only went out to grocery store to buy vegetables for my baby’s purées. I barely talk to my friends or see them since we live an hour away from them now. As well as my family. So I had considered my husband as my only friend that I can talk to at the moment. When he comes home from work I sometimes try to do something to bring entertainment to my life or just spend quality time with him. I asked him if I can show him a movie I really enjoyed cause I want to be able to talk to someone about it. He wasn’t too thrilled but finally agreed after I begged him. Only for him to fall asleep in the first 10 min. I just told him “it’s fine we can watch it another time…you can take your nap you’re tired” and he keeps telling me that he’ll watch it but I said it’s no use if he’s just gonna fall asleep. So he proceeds to do so. He napped for about and hour and a half…and I tended to the baby. Don’t know when he’ll actually watch cause he’s always tired. Another thing I tried to talk to him about was about the drake and Kendrick beef. I finally looked into it and I wanted to show my husband and yes it’s not important but it’s just entertainment. I wanted someone to talk about it with. He wasn’t interested. I got mad telling him I always listen to his story’s even though it’s about the most pathetic thing but I listen and I engage and I ask questions because I want to talk to my husband but he wouldn’t do the same for me. After a while he said sorry…but that’s it…I didn’t say anything. I put the baby to sleep and he gets on his PC to play. I can’t sleep at this point cause I’m so upset and I just give him one worded answers when he goes to sleep. Now I’m here crying at 2am while he and my baby are sound asleep. And once again I’m alone. Tbh the reason I wanted to post this isn’t to get advice.

209,"I'll start with a little background for context. I have always dealt with some degree of anxiety (and perhaps depression) for years, often leading to bouts of insomnia before getting pregnant. The longest it would last would be maybe a month and simply just having difficulty getting to sleep. I had one week or two of insomnia while pregnant, but honestly was less anxious than usual. Flash forward to now, I'm 5 months pp and have been struggling to get a good nights rest for nearly 3 months, and (at least for the last 2 months) it's not the baby.



The first 10-12 weeks, yeah the baby made it difficult to get good rest. He was colicky and breastfeeding was going poorly. I transitioned to being an exclusive pumper and the schedule I was having to keep to try to increase my poor supply only served to mess with my sleep even more. I'd sleep fairly good for the first half of the night, but got to where when I woke up to pump in the middle of the night, I struggled to get back to sleep. I dropped the middle of the night pump early January and had initial improvement in my sleep. I'd still wake up before my alarm, only getting 1-2 hours more than I had been. Then I started having trouble getting to sleep and still waking up early. I started feeling anxious just looking at my bed. So I moved to the couch and it worked... for a bit. Then was the day I went 40 hours without sleep... I was in crisis mode and my primary doctor basically said ""sorry, can't help. Nothing we can prescribe you because you're breastfeeding."" Thankfully, my OB was able to see me and questioned if I'm depressed/anxious because I'm not sleeping or not sleeping because I'm depressed/anxious. Honestly, I don't know which came first at this point. 

  
She prescribed me Trazadone to help me sleep. And it did help. So did weaning from pumping. But my old friend insomnia still seems to be sticking around. If I don't take the Trazadone, it takes me forever to get to sleep and I still wake up early. I've been sick recently, so I've even paired it with NyQuil a few nights, which seems more effective but still not getting a full night of rest (NyQuil used to leave me drowsy the next day... apparently not anymore). Last night took me forever to get to sleep and I only slept maybe 4 hours before being woken by my husband's coughing. I just feel at a loss of what to do. I miss sleeping in bed, but just seeing it makes me anxious. The couch is making my body hurt and honestly probably contributing to my poor sleep at this point. I'm anxious about feeling like I NEED something to get to sleep rather than falling asleep like I used to, and my prescription is almost out. 

  
Not looking for medical advice, but hoping to hear if anyone has or is going through something similar right now. Has anything helped you to get back a semblance of normalcy?

 Im self employed,  and have always taken pride in my clients care... but while pregnant I did a few major things wrong... the biggest one i never told my clients I was pregnant, for fear of losing business... but in the end I did lose. I messed up on many significant details during transactions that cost my clients money and time. I 100% hate myself for this. 

The other is due to delivering such poor care,  i had a BAD year financially like bringing in less than $5000 bad... thank goodness for my husband having a good stable job but this put our family in a HUGE bind because right before I found out I was pregnant I made a pretty large purchase from a person/ company that I had great dealings with before and he trusted me in good faith, I had intentions of it being covered and paid for within a month of receiving.... well a week after that is when I got the news (very unexpected) and shit hit the fan... making it impossible to cover and pay for...i ultimately kind of forgot about it until this past January when a sheriff showed up with judgment papers �� naming myself AND husband...he had zero part in what i did and his job is at risk now that he's roped into this...i again hate myself for all this turmoil and loss of trust from my husband as well as the company i always used and supported... but in my nature to do ANY of the above i don't want to blame the pregnancy but it sure feels like it had a major effect on my overall thinking and performance. 

There's nothing I can do about this besides learn from my mistakes and ask for forgiveness, it's in process of being paid off.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for besides getting thoughts out in the open",,"need get thought chest baby   month feel slowly come fog look back can not help come term irresponsible pregnant flat sabotage careerreputation finance last year

213,"My ex partner broke if off over the the Christmas holidays. 

It was been very difficult and im pretty sure I'm really depressed. I'm lost and in despair and can not handle the volatility.

Recently she was telling she loved me and she needed some time to focus on her self mentally, emotionally & physically.

I take my baby 4 to 5 days a week as that's the arranged schedule. 

I try to support her as much as can with the terms I've been given. She allows me to do bed time routine every Tuesday & some times Thursday. 

Her moods have been so volatile and seems like my presence is just hated. She's one day reasonable and then the next just absolutely cold recluse and mean.

I'm starting to now getting thoughts of wanting to commit suicide my self because I'm afraid my life with my child will be nothing but conflict and hate. 

I'm really depressed and I try to turn to prayer when I start to spiral but I'm at my wits end. I dont know how much longer I can take of this. I'm don't wanna to end my life and leave my daughter fatherless. 

But im not in a good place mentally and I'm trying to work on my self but I feel when I have bad days it's really bad. I see a therapist it helps but with the constant interaction with my baby's momma I'm beginning to degrade and I have terrible anxiety. I shake un controllably when I have to face her face to face. 

I'm really in a bad place. I dont know what to do any more. This constant pain and the outlook of being a single father has destroyed my peace and I really want to end my life.

216,"I wanted to add my story for any mom out there who might be struggling with postpartum anxiety/depression and who is on the fence about whether or not to take Zurzuvae. I had the box in my closet for almost two months before finally deciding to start the medication, and now that I'm seeing the benefits, I wish I had taken it sooner. I am taking it at 7 months postpartum. 

One thing that kept me from starting earlier was the UTI side effect. I hate UTI's, and the thought of dealing with that on top of everything was overwhelming. The first day after I started taking the meds, I bought AZO and cranberry tablets and that helped me feel a bit more in control as I started the treatment. Sometimes, just feeling like I'm doing something proactive helps a lot. 

Background: I have struggled with postpartum anxiety since having my first child in 2020, but with this, my third postpartum, there were also definite clouds of depression. I have used the word ""hopeless"" a few times to describe my feelings to loved ones and my doctor, and that's how I knew that depression was in play. My doctor didn't hesitate to diagnose my PPD and to order the prescription for Zurzuvae, saying that it had been a ""miracle"" drug for the patients she had prescribed it for. I received the medication about two weeks later, and then I put it in my closet while I debated whether or not I wanted to take it. It was probably the PPA and PPD at the wheel because it was hard for me to overcome my sense of impending doom. Three days ago, I had a conversation with my sister and through tears, I finally knew it was time to give it a try. I was tired of not being emotionally available for my kids, the baby as well as the older two. I took my first dose at 8pm and then went to bed.

Day 1: Thankfully, my husband handles night feeding because I was so drowsy, I could barely walk straight when my older kid woke me up around 4:00 in the morning needing help getting back to sleep. It felt like I was drunk. I went back to bed and by 6:30, I was still very drowsy, but I was able to function enough for my family's morning hustle. I was able to drive my kid to school at 8:30 and I could function at work, but I felt buzzed or hungover for most of the day. I didn't feel any benefits on day 1. In fact, the drowsiness made things feel much worse. My head started clearing just as it was time to take my second dose, which I took at 6pm with hopes my head would clear sooner the next day.

Day 2: This was a dark day for me. I was able to function in the morning, avoiding driving until 10:00. I still felt buzzed, muddled, unfocused, and drowsy all day, but I also felt really down. Had I not decided to give it at least three days, I might have stopped taking the meds after this day. I was weepy, low energy, and just not quite there. I felt like I was doing a horrible job at work and at home. Hoping that the research would hold true for me, I took the third dose at 6pm. The drowsiness had been taking about 4 hours to hit me, so I was able to do bedtime and cleanup without any issues.

Day 3: I woke up feeling drowsy but...hopeful! The weather was awful and my kids were home for a snow day, but I was actually feeling, dare I say, happy. Other women describe it as feeling like a cloud has been lifted, and I can see that. I felt more at ease, less irritable, and just more present with my family and with my work today. I still felt a little muddled mentally, but I was definitely feeling the benefits of the medication and I did not hesitate to take that evening's dose. I took it at 6pm with dinner and two tablespoons of peanut butter, which has worked well for me. I slept well and hard.

Day 4: I was a bit groggy when I woke up, and I didn't feel the same ""high"" as the day before, but I'm not as groggy and dark as I was the first two days of taking the medication. I still felt irritable and short tempered, but I was not weepy or as down as I had been before. I was able to focus a bit better on this day. I noticed throughout the day moments that would have made me ""rage"" in the past but were just mildly annoying. I also experienced some benefits later in the day while prepping dinner for a group. We had somewhere to be, but instead of feeling tightly wound and anxious, I was able to tackle meal prep in a more relaxed way. It feels like the anxiety is being smoothed if that makes sense. I took my dose at 6pm this evening with two tablespoons of peanut butter, but I waited a bit to each dinner. I felt the meds hit hard without a meal in my stomach. I felt drunk and woozy. Once I got food in my stomach, I started equalizing.

Day 5: I woke up without feeling groggy and the day felt fine. I found that I was able to laugh and smile a bit easier, like I'm getting to some sort of equilibrium. I felt less groggy today and more like my old self. I was able to focus better at work, as well.

Days 6-14: I was definitely feeling less groggy in the mornings. Smiling and laughing came easier, and I was feeling more focused at work, which was a huge improvement. I guess I just felt ""normal"", but in a good way. My stomach felt a little ""off"" and I have had some congestion, but it's been very minor and maybe unrelated to taking the drug. I push all these days together because, at this point, the side effects had largely subsided. By the time I was in the second week, I was sleeping really well at night, and the grogginess in the morning was wearing off pretty quickly. Overall, I have felt more balanced after taking the meds. I still have some anxiety, some sadness, some grey days, but I feel like my low point has been reset. I have felt more hopeful, optimistic, and better able to let anxious thoughts go since taking the medicine. I feel more connected to my kids and better able to see the bright side of things.

If you are on the fence, just take it! I didn't know if my condition was ""bad"" enough to warrant the drugs, but I can see now that anything helpful is worth doing. I don't think I believed I really had PPD, but now that the clouds have cleared, I can see there was definite biological causes for my difficulties. I am now about a month out, and I'm still feeling the positive effects, so it was 100% worth it for me. The drawbacks were negligible, and the benefits have been remarkable.

230,"Hi everyone,

My wife gave birth to our beautiful baby boy at 5 days ago. The first nights were tough - baby has colic and my wife was exhausted. I stayed up all night and helped as best as I could - she did manage to get some sleep I believe. 

She has been emotionally drained however and I completely understand. I am a foreigner and we live in her country of origin and I speak the language only superficially, meaning that unfortunately the weight of the bureaucracy has fallen on her. I’ve helped by cooking meals and doing most house chores - cleaning, arranging as well as driving us around to appointments.

This afternoon something happened and my wife caught me absentmindedly eating a booger. Her mood changed in an instant. She became confrontational and irritated straight away. She told me I disgust her and that she doesn’t want me around nor want to sleep with me. 

I tried talking to her later. I was keeping the baby for an hour while she was showering. She came back to the room and asked me to leave or she would. I told her this was still our bed but if that meant she wouldn’t get enough sleep I’d leave her space.

I sent her a phone message later saying I love you and hope you have a goodnight sleep. And she replied with: “think about where do you want to take this relationship, because I honestly can’t imagine anything to do with you in terms of being your wife”. I asked her what did she mean by that and she replied that it’s very straightforward, she cannot see herself as my wife anymore, and she’s considering moving to her parents house or finding another arrangement. 

She said “I had never imagined this happening to this relationship but I guess it was due.”

I’m trying to calm myself down but I’m in the middle of a panic attack. As is she. I’m not sure this may be Postpartum rage or postpartum depression, but in case it is I want to support my wife through this dark forest. I’m open to any suggestions.

Thank you.

I am on day 3. I have not slept in 3 days. Maybe combined 6 hours. When I do get some sleep it is restless and horrible.

I’m not sure if it’s because I get frustrated sleeping or what. Last, I’m late on my period, not pregnant. I saw online this could be because of lexapro. I really do not want it to hinder my fertility at all.

The last year has been rough. We had a rough pregnancy with lots of complications for me and my twins. One of the twins was in the NICU for 45 days. The other was in for 124 days and in two different hospitals. She ended up having heart surgery out of state. Hardest 4 months of my life. In that time, I was able to bond with one of the twins at home, I was able to breastfeed her for a while before my supply gave up due to stress. The other twin was strictly on an NG tube so she was never able to breastfeed before she was out of the hospital. By the time she was out my supply was gone. So I never got that bond with her. She’s been home for about two months now and I have not been able to form a bond with her. She spends a lot of time crying no matter how hard I try to comfort her. I feel like she hates me. She cries all day until her dad is home and then she smiles and laughs with him. (I’m a stay at home mom) The other twin loves me. I’m her favorite person ever. I don’t know what to do but I have no bond with the other twin and it hurts my heart. It almost annoys me. I’m annoyed by her constant crying without allowing me to comfort her but her dad can comfort her in an instant. And I’m annoyed by the lack of bond between us..

I'm 9 weeks pp and I feel like a shell just empty. I'm happy to have my baby but I feel so so lost just waiting for my maternity leave to end so I can go back to work and talk to adults but also sad to have to leave my baby. I ended up having an emergency c-section and I'm learning to accept my newly acquired scar and how my birth didn't go how I wanted it at all. I did my makeup and put on a dress for the first time pp and felt like fraud just so ugly, I'm so mad at my husband for doing this to me even tho I wanted a baby just as much as him. I've been lying on those little questionnaires that they give you at check ups but I feel ok somedays and absolutely horrible others and I'm wondering if I should get medical help or if it will level out on its own. 

I'm really really upset that I had to have a c-section and everyone around me is telling me to just be grateful to have a healthy baby which i am! It's just so hard to have nothing go the way I imagined it. Whenever I try to talk to my husband about how hard caring for our baby is and how I'm having a hard time he just says ""you knew parenting wasn't going to be easy"". It makes me livid when he says that shit. He's still on paternity leave as well but he spends his days sleeping and playing computer games for the most part. He'll watch the baby for about an hour or 2 at a time once or twice a day. So I feel like he doesn't understand what I'm going through at all I'm watching the baby at least 20 hours a day and he acts like those few hours are so hard on him.

My husband and I moved two hours from our home town right after we had our baby, we couldn’t afford to buy a home in the place we grew up so we moved away.

254,"Hello all!

My brother and his gf had their first baby in the fall. She has always been a bit crazy even before she got pregnant (example: made a scene at the grocery store and squared up to an older lady because she told my brother he had unique eyes - which he does, he’s received that compliment his whole life) but since having the baby, her emotions have been at an all time high on both ends. I feel terrible for her because there is no neutral ground for her anymore.

I believe she knows she is having signs of PPD as she’ll post on social media crying about the baby and how she’s struggling but when my brother tries to help with anything or simply talk to her, she rages and tells him how stupid he is or that he’s a POS. One time I was on the phone with him when he asked if he could feed the baby for her because she was tired and she started screaming and said she would c*t her head off and c*t her wrist if that would make him leave her alone. About twice a week she packs her car up with the baby’s things and tries to take her daughter to her grandmas to live there while my brother is at work. Yesterday when she tried that it was because my brother was active on Snapchat while he was at work (it was something I sent him) and she thought he was cheating (he’s never cheated a day in his life). 

He’s tried to bring up the ppd with her and talked about her speaking with the doctor and she just wants no part of it and gets mad again. At this point, I’m worried about her, my brother, AND the baby all being in an environment that can get that extreme. He’s at a loss for what to do and how to help, she’s living like she doesn’t want to acknowledge it, and unfortunately she doesn’t really have any friends or family she can confide in. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!!

(Side note - I’m sorry if I come off insensitive or not understanding in any way. I’ve got no kids but I do understand how much your body goes through and how easy it is to be all over the place while you try to heal. Again, I’m just looking for help for them)",,"hello

255,"I am a doctor, i used to work but took a break to write a few exams and decided to have a baby( husbands choice, i was fine with never having one) . I wasnt forced, i just never really thought about having kids. Decided it was the best time to have one while i was on leave( it was supposed to be a year long break to finish my exams. 

I got pregnant pretty quick and suffered chronic UTI throughout the pregnancy. My baby was also very large so i had a lot of pain and trouble breathing by the end of pregnancy. Had a very traumatic delivery as well. Ended up with a 10 pound baby who never ever sleeps. 

In all of this my husband has done nothing. The bare minimum of giving a bottle of milk once or twice a week, taking care of the baby for a couple of hours once or twice a week. 
I am resentful, he has sacrificed nothing for this baby, not a single night , and he is being hailed as a great father. I have done everything and i am being made the villain for complaining about lack of sleep and for asking my husband to help more. 

I have gone through so many sleepless nights that i have started having hallucinations and nightmares and sleep paralysis. I begged my husband to care for the baby one night so i can try and sleep 8-10 hour at a stretch. 
He slept before i could actually make him go through this. He slept 10 hours the next day as well. And the next day. 

He works, i dont. And somehow that makes it easier for him to do no childcare and everyone justifies it as well. He was also very unhelpful during my pregnancy and made me cry hours after postpartum . He forced me to keep a name his parents wanted and didnt speak to me postpartum until i agreed . 

I am so tired. I have stopped interacting with him now and i am getting religious texts from his mother about how i need to find god to cure my depression and texts from her son about booking a psychiatrist.
I am aware i have depression, i have had it before when my father passed away so i know what it looks like, yet them acknowledging it is pissing me off? I dont know how to respond to this situation now.

257,"This probably isn’t the right place to post about this, but I just need help, or even just kind words.

So I worked in childcare prior to having my baby and finding a nanny/daycare job that’s okay with my daughter tagging along has been more than a struggle. I’ve had a ton of families from Facebook groups requesting my services, then all of a sudden get ghosted as soon as they find out I have a baby as if that wasn’t wasn’t in my description they found me from. 

Anyways, I’m 1 month postpartum and finally got a job offer from a daycare, I’d be in charge of the infants class 9/hrs a day, 5 days/week. The catch is that I’d need alternate care for my daughter since she can’t be in the infants class because I’m in charge of it. So basically I’d need to be okay with a complete stranger at a separate daycare watching over my precious daughter for half of the week and just trust that nothing bad would happen to her until she’s able to age in to the older group at my daycare about a year from now. 

The thought alone of being away from her that long and that often feels like I’m getting my heart ripped out of my chest, I don’t even want to know how painful it will be once I actually have to do it.

258,"I 24F and my boyfriend’s 25M relationship has been really honestly struggling ever since I found out I was pregnant. Some context: we were only together for a year, living together for 5 months before getting pregnant, it was obviously not planned (but we did nothing to prevent it). When we found out thats where everything started to crumble, he wanted me to have an abortion- I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself and I have the financial means on my own to care for a baby on my own. It took weeks, I even had an appointment set up at planned parenthood to appease him, finally I stood up for myself and told him I am doing this with or without him and completely understand if he wanted to leave, I gave him multiple outs. 

He decided to stay and “learn to accept the baby” but not help with anything, so I spent my entire pregnancy going to appointments alone, planning the nursery, learning everything you need to know to be a parent, etc. Also, while still cooking every day, our home became a mess because I couldn’t keep up with the cleaning. He would also purposely do things to stress me out, he doesn’t like my dog so he’d purposely antagonize him to make him growl/bark/yelp just to get a reaction out of him. I’d scream and yell and tell him he’s stressing me out so bad and I need him to stop, leave the dog alone and he wouldn’t.

Fast forward to now, our son is here and 5 months old and he is the absolute love of our life’s. He is a great dad on paper, he loves our son unconditionally and would do anything for him, but he needs instructions for everything. I work from home so I am home with the baby all day, while working. He comes home at around 6:30ish every day and will greet and hold the baby but won’t do anything else unless I explicitly ask. I cook dinner for us most nights (on the nights I don’t I pick and pay for the takeout) Ex: I have to ask him hey can you change the baby so I can finish making YOUR dinner, can you give him this bottle so I can take a shower, can you put him down for the night, Its exhausting. I feel like I am both a housewife and a project manager assigning tasks for him to do. 

The issues with the dog is still there, he just will not leave the dog alone, he goes out of his way to antagonize him tells me “I can’t wait for him to die” “I hope he chokes and dies” “I hate him”, then when I get angry he tells me that I am being dramatic, it was a joke and that I’m a terrible dog mom and he isn’t trained. 

I’ve told him so many different times, I don’t feel loved by you, I need more etc. He gets angry and will give me the silent treatment every time I voice my issues. It’s gotten to the point I’ve just began keeping it to myself because nothing changes anyways. I feel like I am constantly just victimizing myself, I can’t even see his side to things anymore. 

I don’t know what to do, I love him, I want to be together and for it to be genuine, I cannot stay with him just because of our baby.  I’m sick of feeling this way.

TLDR: Since my pregnancy, I’ve felt unsupported. My boyfriend loves our son but only helps when asked, dismisses my feelings, and antagonizes my dog. I feel exhausted, unloved, and unsure how to move forward, even though I want our relationship to work, I’m afraid its too far gone",,"f boyfriend relationship really honestly struggle ever since find pregnant context together year live together   month get pregnant obviously plan nothing prevent find everything start crumble want abortion know would not able live financial mean care baby take week even appointment set plan parenthood appease finally stand tell without completely understand want leave give multiple out

274,"I was diagnosed with postpartum depression when baby was around 10-12 weeks old.
She spent the first six weeks of her in hospital while having open heart surgery at two weeks old.

I had to give birth in another city and spent 9 weeks away from my three year old. I saw him once in that time. I really really struggled being away from home and my son. I struggled with the isolation of the hospital environment. Thankfully my husband was with me most of the time except for when I was rooming in with bubs. 

Looking back I think the PND started during pregnancy after the heart condition was detected at the anatomy scan. It was a stressful pregnancy mentally and being my third pregnant it really took a toll on my body so it was hard physically. 

I also have unresolved grief and emotions surrounding my first baby who was stillborn.

So, it's not really surprising that I'm struggling with motherhood this time around. I am angry ALL the time. I rage out often. I'm a shitty person to be around. I resent my baby and have not established a real bond with her. I feel so freakn shitty and guilty for this feelings. She's just being a normal baby doing normal things but everything is so so hard. I'm sick of it being hard.

My husband is amazing and does as much as he can. My oldest is in preschool three days a week and I do have family support. I am incredibly grateful for my support system. I would be very lost without them.

I'm taking meds. I'm doing therapy. I'm trying but nothing is getting better. I'm so scared of never having a bond with her. I'm scared of ruining her because I yell at her. I swear at her. It's awful and it's wrong. But I get so frustrated I have to get it out somehow and it's not always realistic to put her down and walk away. I just want to run away from everything and everyone.

I find myself frequently spacing out when I'm feeding him and even when I'm surrounded by family and friends. It feels like I'm alone though I know I'm not. Recently, I realized my most prominent feeling is like I had a miscarriage (I've never experienced a miscarriage and this is our first baby, but that is the only way I can think to describe the way I'm feeling). Since my baby was inside me growing for so long, I got used to feeling him move. After giving birth, I obviously don't feel him move anymore, and it just feels like I'm empty inside. I know it's not rational, and I understand he's perfectly okay, but I feel this intense sense of loss. My mom and sister don't know the feeling I'm talking about, so I kind of feel like I'm going crazy. I'm working with my psychiatrist to adjust my current meds (I have bipolar, anxiety and insomnia) but I'm looking for support anywhere I can find it, and I guess some validation about the way I'm feeling.

282,"I am freshly postpartum and my world is reeling from how quick transition from pregnancy, through birth, then now has been. My husband has been absolutely wonderful support and so in love with our baby - physical recovery so far has been uncomfortable but I’ve been able to just heal in bed while easing into breastfeeding, motherhood, etc. But, I am an emotional wreck. I have a history of mental health challenges, which I’ve been able to manage with my husband and healthcare providers in my corner, and pregnancy was wonderful. 

I was prepared to feel a lot of heightened emotion but am surprised at how it’s manifesting. I feel this overwhelming, suffocating grief and sadness now that pregnancy is over. I’m grateful my baby is here and that we get to spend our lives together, but I’m devastated. It’s the most confusing feeling - so happy yet so sorrowful. I wasn’t ready to no longer feel kicks or rolls, to not have my giant belly, to not listen to his heartbeat at appointments… I can’t even look at ultrasounds or photos of me while pregnant without sobbing. 

And when I say sobbing, I mean sometimes to the point of just escalating into pure panic. Then the anxious thoughts starts because now that I’m not pregnant, I can’t protect my baby like I could before and something could happen. I can’t wait to watch baby grow but at the same time I want time to freeze so I can just stay in this newborn phase with my family forever. My heart can’t handle the thought of change. I just stare at the little hands and toes and cry. I’m not sure if that even makes sense. 

I’m not overwhelmed by anything except how I feel. The hormone crash is intense. I’ve talked to my husband about how I’ve been feeling and it’s a struggle to form sentences through the tears. My Dr. was able to see me today and gave me referrals to great resources. So, I’m not alone. I also am aware that emotional upheaval is normal and will most likely pass as my body adjusts but… I just needed one more second with my beautiful baby while pregnant. To feel that connection again. My heart is so full and so heavy.

283,"To all of the people in this group, I just wanted to share something that helped me tremendously on my PPD journey. I had pretty terrible PPD with a NICU baby, emergency c-section, and near-death experience during childbirth - it was one of the most challenging periods of my life. Not to mention hating breastfeeding and wanting to throw my husband off a cliff. 

I did a ton of therapy, and after a while, my therapist suggested that I try psilocybin. I tried it, and it truly changed my life. It was like 50 therapy sessions in 5 hours. I don't know where I would be without today. I share this because I learned that there is a stage 2 clinical trial where moms with PPD can get access to a psilocybin experience. If anyone is really struggling - it might be worth looking into - it's incredible to be on the other side of crippling depression. 

Feel free to DM or chat me, and I can share more.

285,"So, I found out that I had post partum depression/ rage after my mom had a serious conversation with me about it when my son was about 4 months old. Well I talked to my doctor and got on the medication. And I was in it for a while and then I ran out and wasn’t able to get more of the medication but I didn’t think I needed it bc I was feeling fine all of the bad thoughts and everything were gone, and then about 2-3 weeks later it came back and it was worse. So I figured out a way to get a refill of my medicine and it helped for a little bit and then I ran out again. And this happened about two more times, I’d run out and wouldn’t be able to get more and it’d come back worse a couple weeks later. Well this time I haven’t been on the medicine for about 5 months. And I’m still struggling but it’s been enough that I can manage it by myself without medication. But here the last week or two my son (16months) has been teething and he’s been an absolute menace he’s constantly getting into everything, he doesn’t want me to pick him up or touch him but he also doesn’t want me to put him down so it’s nom stop screaming and fighting. And not to mention he’s been constantly hitting and kicking and head butting me. And I try to do the whole “gentle hand s” and rub my face with hus hand but that doesn’t work it pisses him off more, I tried popping him when he hits me and that makes it worse, I’ve tried ignoring it and that does absolutely nothing. Im a single mother, hus dad says he wants to be in his life but puts in no effort to see him or help with him. I am out if a job right now, and even if I wanted to go back to work there’s no one who can watch my son while im at work, and no one who can bring me to work unless I work nights, but if u work nights I won’t be able to sleep at all, my son has a total of maybe one to three hours in naps a day, and I can’t survive off 1-3 hours of sleep a day. And I live with my grandmother and aunt and uncle, and I want so badly to ask for help but I can’t bc they’re always tired from work and stuff and I feel so crappy asking for help. But I need help, I need to get away from my kid for one day. I love him so fucking much but I can’t breathe. Im starting to get extremely angry withh him extremely quickly, and there’s been a couple times that I almost did hurt him and I had to force myself to put him in his bed and I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get help, I can’t get anyone to bring me to get more medicine, I can’t even get help from hus father.

Im a FTM, my daughter is now 2 and things are “normalizing” for me now with work and my daughter is in child care. 

When i gave birth, it was a really bad time for me as i had ppd and felt so alone. Recovered alone, took care of daughter alone, financially had to support family alone as husband lost his job and was depressed too. It was a tough almost 1 yr going through that alone but i’ll never forget the things MIL did and said to me at that time.

Recently i was looking through old pics of my daughter and emotions from my ppd days came flooding in. I started to break down bcs the feelings i felt still seems so raw. Im supposed to visit my MIL but i told my husband i didnt want to see MIL bcs of this raw feelings and flashback. - important to note that we do visit her every 3-4 weeks but she’s demanding to visit every 1-2 week now and its causing me major anxiety thinking about seeing her that often

He was visibly upset and he didnt understand why i “couldnt” get over it. I told him he wouldnt understand bcs i was so alone and the feelings are still so fresh in my mind, even though it has been 2 years. While i feel he should be more understanding, i know it sucks for him too always being in the middle. 

Does it get better? Will i forget about my ppd days one day?

I just feel empty every time I look at myself. I love my son so much but I feel like I have died. We have an 18 month old golden doodle, who acts great when my husband is home but when I’m alone with her, she grabs burb cloths, pacifiers, our laundry, and some other things. I think it’s because she likes me chasing her and thinks it’s play, but I can’t chase her as well with my leg so I’ve had to lure her with treats and grab whatever when she’s been eating the treat. Lately I feel like if it’s not my son crying, my dog is whining, and I’m trying to keep the house in relative order. My leg hurts so much from all the walking around the house I’m doing it’s extremely painful for me to do the night feeds, so my husband is doing it, which is making me feel guilty as well.

I was pretty good at showering when my son naps but lately I’m too scared to so I’ve waited until my husband gets home, usually I’m begging him to walk the dog (she’s usually whining to go out, but he’s does the ‘she’s fine give me a few minutes’) so I can shower with peace of mind that someone is around if he needs anything. 

I get really mad now about everything. All the visitors we’ve been having I’m annoyed, when I don’t have visitors I’m anxious about being alone all day. I can’t go anywhere because I’m having car issues right now. I’m in so much pain with my legs, I’ve considered trying to cut my leg off.  I’m annoyed at my husband because I spend my time cleaning up the items he leave out that my dog is grabbing and when I’m trying to have a a few minutes of me time, he ends up yelling for me to come look at what our son is doing. I’ve yelled at my dog so much and said things that are out of character for me. I’ve thought about leaving her outside and leaving her at the pound. I’ve thought about dropping her and my son off at my moms and fleeing. I say frequently I wish my husband could take my mat leave and I can go back to work. I go to sleep hoping I don’t wake up. I just feel like I’m failing everyone around me.

295,"Firstly, I’m a second time father.  My current gf and I had our first child (my second) 6 months ago.  We have our issues of course, but the last 6 months I’ve felt my gf slip away.  I now see how I’ve frustrated her with trying to help solve problems and always be the “solutions guy” even when not asked.  The sad part is, we used to have really open, vulnerable communication at the beginning of our two year relationship, but as of late, attempting even that has been met with what I can only describe as a sullen teenager’s response (aggression, dismissal, annoyance) from my partner.  Now I realize this is a very delicate period but things have progressively worsened, coming to a head about a month ago in an argument in which we both screamed at each other.  This is definitely not the norm for us but since then it’s effectively been two individuals coexisting in a home.  I tried to hug her a week later and the look of disdain I received was gut wrenching.  

Fast forward to Monday and she completely moved out while I was at work, taking almost everything we collectively (I mostly) have provided for our baby.  She did this under the guise of “needing space” and it being “temporary” but the actions and way she went about this don’t give me reassurance.  She seems to be all over the place emotionally and if I so much as mention that (out of concern, not criticism), while I/we certainly have issues, postpartum feelings may be amplifying or intensifying the negative feelings towards me, she flat out scoffs in my face that she’s “fine.”  The thing is I’ve known her long enough to see that she’s anything but fine.  She under eats, doesn’t get good sleep, has given up on her appearance (not that I personally care, but that’s something she prides herself deeply on), quit working out or trying (once again, not a mandate from me, but something she was so absorbed with throughout the pregnancy and right after the birth- getting back on that horse).  She even started drinking nightly 5 months postpartum, which we’ve never done as long as I’ve known her.  When I delicately asked “is this a thing now” she snapped at me as if I was blowing it all out of proportion.  It’s at the point where if I have any concern and voice it, even trying to be as tactful as possible, I’m met with flat out denial/refusal to see that something is off.

This also isn’t a situation where she’s carrying the load, although it seems like she feels that way.  I do all cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, and am extremely hands on with the kids (I do virtually all tasks pertaining to my older and split many of the baby tasks).  I’ve always told her to ask for help if she needs a break but she never once has.  Something else strange that started happening is every time I’d take our baby to the changing station to change her, my gf would be standing over my shoulder, and by the time I’m putting the clean diaper on, she’s putting her hands in and taking over the task (4 hands for one diaper is too many cooks in the kitchen).  I don’t understand if this is a trust in my parenting abilities issue but I’m confused by it and have even asked why she does that as I have it under control.  Not sure if this is a maternal instinct or if I’m over analyzing but it’s happened probably a dozen times.

I’m worried that she’s now making rash decisions in the midst of an already extremely difficult time and I have no idea what to do.  She’s now living alone in a run down house compared to our house we bought together and built our life in, leaving me and my daughter (effectively her step daughter- even calls her “mom”) behind very confused.  I can own my part in frustration and not handling the sudden change in her demeanor and sudden non-communication well, but I can’t help but feel like this “one month of space” is really just a protracted break up.  Can I save this? Or it best to focus on my new reality bc fighting/working towards reconciliation/healing only a lost cause?  Any advice would be extremely appreciated.
 
UPDATE: She has fully moved out which is painful but the hard part for me that I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to wrap my head around is that I’ve been positioned as an adversary/antagonist.  Sucks that you can provide and give without getting in return only to be thrown under the bus but maybe there’s a lesson in there for me somewhere, not clear what that is.",,"firstly second time father   current gf first child second   month ago   issue course last   month feel gf slip away   see frustrate try help solve problem always solution guy even ask   sad part use really open vulnerable communication beginning two year relationship late attempt even meet describe sullen teenager response aggression dismissal annoyance partner   realize delicate period thing progressively worsen come head month ago argument scream   definitely norm we since effectively two individual coexist home   try hug week later look disdain receive gut wrench

298,"Hello,

I'm a mom of a toddler and a newborn, and I’m hoping to find some solidarity here. My situation seems a bit different from what I often read about—my toddler has been downright mean and distant towards me since our newborn came home. I know the more common challenge is toddlers being aggressive toward the new baby, but my toddler’s aggression is all directed at me. He isn’t acting out toward the baby or his dad—just me.

I’m a stay-at-home mom and was with him 24/7 before the baby arrived. He always favored me and would only want me for everything—whether it was getting a snack or being taken out of his highchair, it was always ""Mommy."" Since the baby came, though, he acts like I’m invisible. He screams “no” at me, won’t make eye contact, hits me, and just seems to want nothing to do with me.

I’m breastfeeding, and my newborn cluster feeds a lot, so she’s on me constantly. As a result, my husband has taken over a lot of the toddler duties, and I’m still recovering from a C-section. I’ve been doing everything I can think of to make my toddler feel special—scheduling one-on-one time with him every day, involving him in helping with the baby, explaining what’s going on, and trying to reassure him. But nothing seems to be working. 

I know this is likely his way of processing the change, and I understand he’s hurt, but it still hurts me deeply. I’m trying to stay strong in front of him, but it’s really hard. It feels so isolating, and I just need to hear from anyone who’s been through this. I feel like I'm the only one experiencing this, and the emotional toll is tough—especially with postpartum feelings in the mix.

Please, no negative comments. I’m already struggling, and I could really use some support from others who’ve been through something similar.

Thank you.

301,"7 months postpartum and I think I have PPD, called my doctor so I'll be seeing them next week but I never realized how alone I felt until now.

I've tried to go back to something of my ""normal self"" and I think I'm finally realizing I'm not going to be able to go back to being her.. I love being a mom and I love my baby so much. I just can't believe I have to let go of who I used to be.

Before I found out I was pregnant, my life was going pretty well. I had accomplished quite a lot for my career, and it started taking off. Then I found out I was pregnant. Just when I thought I figured everything out, I found out I gotta take care of someone else. I didn't have an easy pregnancy, with a lot of health complications. Then my birth was traumatic and now I'm left with a husk of my former self.

I'm scared that I'll never find myself again. That I'll just be a mom. My husband doesn't seem to understand that, when I tell him I ""have nothing"". I really mean it. If someone were to ask me what I liked doing, I don't think I could really answer that. 

I'm just wondering when will this feeling go away? Will I ever find myself again? I feel like I don't even have time to think because my baby constantly cries if I don't feed him or I don't put him to bed. My husband tries but he'll cry his head off until I pick him up. I have to constantly pump milk and wake up in the middle of the night to do too. 

The only time I get to go out is groceries or just errands. I never get to have fun.

303,"I am almost 4 months postpartum and I’ve been experiencing rage more than ever before. I had a decently relaxed birth other than hemorrhaging after I delivered. I love my daughter more than anything in the world and have never questioned my bond with her. The rage comes in more with my husband, who is overall a great partner. I really hate his mom, who just tries to help but in doing that oversteps boundaries. She came to the hospital uninvited and was upset they kicked her out of the room due to my medical emergency. She did not once ask how I was doing and still has never asked about me. My husband and I have talked about this and he regrets not standing up for me in these moments but playing devils advocate, we are new parents and everything was happening so quickly. He has really shown so much grace and understanding with my issues with his mom and has not pushed me. But every time he goes to see her with our daughter I get ANGRY. Like could do harm angry. And it’ll stick for days and days. I’ll ignore him because I’m so upset and that’s not fair. I have also been depressed. Not like I don’t feel like myself, but more I know this is the new me and is this what I want for the rest of my life.
Again I LOVE my baby. I wouldn’t trade her for anything. But I am 22 and it’s very hard to think how my whole life is different. My husband is 32 so this is a pretty normal age for him to have kids. Also please don’t make this an age gap issue, it’s not at all. I wasn’t forced to have a baby and trapped in anyway, I think it’s normal to miss your old self and what could have been. 
I am breastfeeding and I do love it, but I think my mood has been the cause of my supply being low and that makes me feel worse. Does anyone have any tips on how to get through this?

I don’t want to be around a bunch of happy people. I don’t want to be around my sisters in law. I know they say relationships are supposed to help you with depression, but I don’t feel like we were really close to begin with. So not going to a wedding wouldn’t be a big deal. The wedding’s not about me anyways so I doubt it would that big of a fuss.

All because I tried to get a job. I can’t even do that right. And my resumé was pathetic. 

And why should I be asking my husband for cosmetic things when I don’t work and I can’t even survive on my own. I wouldn’t know how to lease a car, make a resume, or apply for an apartment. I have no money of my own and no skills other than taking care of kids.

I have a 10 day old with my husband. I have 3 other children. He adores them. However, our marriage hasn’t always been good, honest, or even full of love. It’s been rough, and a challenge. 

He has a dog who stays in the crate in the garage of our home (renting) 24/7.. minus when the dog goes to its section of the backyard. The dog howls and barks CONSTANTLY. We have gotten 2 complaints, and the HOA is fining us for the next complaint, and will require the dog be removed after. 

I don’t like the dog. I wish he didn’t have the dog. But he won’t get rid of it. I do not deal with the dog because the dog has attacked my other children, and is very aggressive. That’s why it’s no longer inside the home. He will yell at her constantly to shut up, and when he’s not home, all she does is bark and howl. 

I feel alone because he has only ever changed one diaper, and sleeps through our son’s cries. I had a traumatic c-section. One where I severely hemorrhaged for 2 days following and required multiple transfusions. I have been at home by myself all day taking care of the baby, doing laundry, cleaning, taking care of other children. When he gets home from work, I clean up after him, and am up all night with the baby. I haven’t slept more than 2 hours a night since our son has been born. Husband sleeps right through his cries and is not much help at all. 

I just went almost 3 days without eating, and don’t have much money left in my savings. I went to order food so I can eat, and he told me to get him something. Surely I didn’t have to, but I did. Well, half way through me trying to eat, the baby woke up and needed my milk. So, here I am at the table, juggling a BF baby, a toddler stealing my food, and a husband who is now more worried about the dog. 

I ate half my meal. Then I tried putting toddler to sleep while double-checking chores are done. 

He went to bed. I’m at the point where I think I want to leave. I feel alone. I feel so much hate for how my body looks right now. (I was in great shape prior to this pregnancy.)

I gave birth a week ago to my beautiful girl but my delivery was nothing but smooth and I keep having flashbacks from it.

310,"        I (22 F) am 3 months postpartum with my only kid. The father is not involved, so I'm raising my son alone, and I love him so much, but it has been a steep learning curve. I knew I was at a high risk for developing post partum depression (PPD) because I've been struggling with depression for the past 11 years at least. I had managed to get it under control, and got to the point where I thought I was ready to go off my meds when I found out I was pregnant, and decided not to mess with my medication for the time being. Due to my experience with depression, I recognized the signs of things getting bad agin, and acted quickly to get myself to a more stable point again. Here is the problem though, I live at home with my mom and step dad, and I feel like he rarely has anything nice to say to me since I gave birth.
         For context, my step dad and I have always had a slightly rocky relationship. I was abused by my bio dad growing up, and therefore had trust issues in regards to new men entering my life. However, my step dad, who I usually refer to as my real dad, was patient and won me over with time. I grew to trust him, but we still have clashing personalities and different ways of expressing ourselves, which often leads to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. We had gotten pretty close, and even talked about getting matching tattoos, because despite our disagreements, we still loved each other very much. I love my dad, and I know he loves his grandson, but lately it feels like he doesn't like me at all. 
        Ever since my son was born, it feels like my dad doesn't have anything nice to say to me unless he's called out for being rude. He questions everything I do in regards to my son, and frequently gives me conflicting critiques. For example, if I go and grab my son as soon as he cries, I'm called an over bearing helicopter mom, but if I let him cry for a bit at a time that's inconvenient for my dad, like when hes watching tv, then he acts like I'm being neglectful. 
          One time, he chewed me out for not having all of the baby's bottles washed at the time, and instead washing one as I needed it. He got really fired up about this, and his tone made it seem like I was neglecting my baby. I could go on, but I'd be here all day. 
        He doesn't even seem interested in talking to me anymore. I ask him how his day was, and get vague, one word answers. I try to tell him jokes, or tell him about my day, or something I read, and he doesn't respond at all. Sometimes there are nice moments where things between us feel the way they used to, but they are often fleeting, and far between. 
           I can't tell if I'm being dramatic, or over thinking things though. I admit that my past traumas still tend to cloud my judgment when it comes to my dad, even after years of therapy, and I don't feel like I'm in the right state of mind these days. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to keep it together for the sake of my son, and I make sure he's well taken care of. He's one of the only things that makes me smile these days, and I love him so much. He's very happy, and healthy, and he smiles so big whenever he sees me, which let's me know I'm doing a good job as a mom, even when my dad makes me doubt that.
        I would like to talk to my mom about it, but her and I don't get much time alone these days, and I don't want to cause tension between her and my dad, especially if I'm just over reacting. Her and I are incredibly close, and have only gotten closer since I got pregnant. I think she would listen to me, and be supportive, but I don't want her to feel like she's caught between me and her husband.
           Honestly, I don't know what I'm hoping for here, I guess I just needed to vent, and feel like I don't have much of another outlet right now. Maybe I need some impartial advice, or just someone to tell me if I'm being dramatic or not. Thank you for anyone who read this far, I appreciate the ability to just get this all off of my chest.

UPDATE
           No one has asked for an update, but for the sake of getting everything off my chest I wanted to write one anyway. 
          I managed to find the time to talk to my mom, and first asked her if she's also noticed my dad's behavior, and she immediately confirmed that she had. This was both a relief and a disappointment, because it meant that I wasn't imagining things, but also meant that I was right about my dad not being very nice to me. My mom suggested that I talk to him and figure out what's going on, which isn't bad advice.
          The main reason I hadn't talked to my dad about it to start off with is he's not the easiest to talk to about stuff like this. He can get very defensive and stubborn, and if he feels like he's being targeted he simply shuts down and is no longer willing to hear anything I have to say. I can be the same way sometimes, which is part of where he and I end up butting heads, but I'm trying to do better. I've spent years learning those to best communicate with my dad to avoid the shut down, but the majority of my energy is going towards caring for my son, so I didn't feel like I had the energy to carefully talk with him. However, I didn't feel it was fair of me to just sit there being upset with him without talking to him about it.
         Before I got the chance though, my dad asked me about it himself. My mom had told him about what I said, which I knew she was likely to do. My mom tells my dad everything unless I ask her not to, which I honestly don't mind, and sometimes actually hope for. My dad asked why I thought he didn't like me, and I was honest and said that while we were in a good spot recently, he hadn't been very nice to me as of late.
          My dad told me that a lot of it is do to stress over things like money, and feeling like I'm taking advantage of him. I work nights so I'm home with my kid during the day, and my parents watch him at night. I thought this arrangement was working fine, but my dad wanted me to put my son in daycare. I explained that I didn't really feel comfortable with putting my baby in a daycare, and my dad was very dismissive. 
            Personally I think the whole stressed out excuse is nonsense. I'm dealing with the stresses of being a new, single mom, who's still trying to work full-time, and I haven't taken it out on anyone. The whole money things seems like a bit of an excuse to me too, especially because I've offered multiple times to help out. I acknowledge that I have a lot more disposable income than them since I'm living at home, and have said multiple times that I'm happy to help with things like bills and groceries. It's only once in a blue moon that they ask me to pay for something, and I've never said no so far. I get that they probably see this as not my problem, because I'm still considered one of the kids, but I am and adult, with a job so if they're stressed enough that my dad isn't treating me well, they should ask me for help more.
            Either way it seems to have gotten better. My dad has been treating me better, and while I do think his reason is a little ridiculous, it is nice to have an explanation for his behavior. 
           Thank you to those who commented and left suggestions. I knew that being a mom was going to be a challenge, but I wasn't prepared for this kind of conflict with my dad. It seems to be working out in the end though.

311,"Hey all. 

I kind of just need to vent a little if that's okay. A lot of people in our life have never really been apart of PPD and this is my first time, but, all that's being said to my wife is 'it's okay' or 'it will get better'. Now, I'm definitely apart of this group, but, hearing my wife cry dozen+ times a day about not being a good mom, or no bond with the baby, or she made a mistake is taking a toll. 

My wife and I struggled so hard to get here. Couldn't conceive naturally and went through IUI and then IVF. One egg and one sperm ended up working and creating our little miracle - Nemo, as we called them through pregnancy. We didn't want to know gender until delivery and when he was born, my wife went through almost 29 hours of labor and needed a C-section because his heartrate was dipping (found out the umbilical cord was around his body like a sash). 

She developed her PPD in hospital, roughly 2 days after my son's birth. It's been about 2 weeks since, and, everyday is the same. I feel awful for my wife because she is so loving and caring and has the ability to be a great mom. But, her PPD is blinding her to this reality. 

And it's hard hearing my wife like this especially when our baby is healthy. We do have a big support system that's helping us through this, but, it's still a lot. We have talked to her OB and they changed her meds and talked about trying to get her on Zurzuvae. She's talked to a therapist and will talk to them more over the coming weeks. 

I'm not sure if I am looking for advice or anything, but, venting is good.

312,"I thought I had gotten lucky and wasn’t going to get hit by ppd. I’ve been on depression meds for awhile, so I thought they were taking care of anything I could be feeling. 
I’ve seen a lot of people in this sub say they have a hard time bonding with their baby or they just don’t love them. I love my baby more than life itself. The further I get into postpartum though, the more I hate myself. 

My birth didn’t go as expected at all. I was trying to have a natural, unmediated birth. I came to terms with needing the epidural. I wasn’t dilating and the epidural wasn’t working currently for me either. So, at 3am, they rushed me back to the OR because I needed an emergency c-section since my baby started to not tolerate the contractions. During my c-section, I lost a lot of blood and kept passing out. My hemoglobin was under 7, but they didn’t want to give me blood after my c-section because I’m “young and healthy.” So, my body failed me by not dilating as it should. 
I planned on exclusively breastfeeding, but my baby lost 13% of his body weight because I wasn’t producing enough. So, my body failed me again. 

I’m snapping at my husband. I can’t sleep when the baby is sleeping because I feel like I’m failing as a mother and a wife. I want him to have the best life possible, but I just can’t get it together. 
I have to go back to school tomorrow because it’s my last semester of nursing school. The thought of leaving him makes me sick. 

I just feel like maybe my husband and baby would be better with me because all I’ve done is fail them. 


I’m calling my OB in the morning to ask for a higher dose of depression meds, but I’m open to other advice as well. ",,"think get lucky not go get hit ppd depression med awhile think take care anything could feel

313,"It’s been a year now and I’m still struggling with depression. I feel like my life isn’t my own anymore and I’m just a slave to my family. I have to do all the things to keep the house running. I still haven’t figured out what will make me happy and just about every day I think about death. I’ve been dreading these days since the fall. So much has happened. I survived Thanksgiving and my husband says cheerfully, “see, we did thanksgiving so you’ll make it through Christmas.”  I interpret that as see, everything is fine and you’re worrying about nothing. 
In the beginning of December my 13 yo daughter was admitted to the ER for self harm. She then went to a mental health hospital for about 3 weeks. She came home the first week of January. It was scary and sad and we had family counseling sessions with her therapist. I felt like I could have been in my daughter’s place. They were talking to her about anxiety and what she needs to do to overcome it. What are the steps? What is your plan, etc. Take self care days, journal your feelings… I told my husband I felt like such a hypocrite being there. How am I supposed to help her when I can’t help myself? 
My husband and I have had a few arguments. I don’t do things for him that show him love. He likes to see me naked and physical affection is his way of being loved. We haven’t had sex for over a year now. It was partly do to the last weeks of my pregnancy, post partum, and then my fear of getting pregnant. I had a hysterectomy in the middle of December so no sex from that. I’m uneasy about having sex with him again. It’s a lot of things that go into that. 
I feel like Christmas for me and the kids didn’t go so well. I told him I wasn’t doing Christmas but I still bought candy, stocking stuffers, and a few gifts for the kids. I did the bare minimum and he dropped the ball on stocking stuffers for me, one of the kids, and a few gifts for some of the kids. 
Then my birthday came up and he planned a dinner for me at a restaurant and invited two couples we know from church. One couple I like, the other I didn’t. The husband of the second couple is one of his good friends that recently got married for the third time. He is a nice man and his wife is nice enough, but I didn’t want them at my birthday dinner. I barely know her and have only spoken to her maybe three times. 
And then… everyone at the table had degrees, jobs, travel adventures and I don’t have a degree, a job, or have traveled the world let alone gone to the spa that is an hour outside of town.  Everyone had been to that spa but me. My husband tried to gift me a spa gift certificate there but in a really lame way. He said, “I’d like to get you a spa gift certificate for “that place” but I don’t know what you want to do there.”  
He knows I would have to get child care bc I don’t know when he would be working (he’s an airline pilot.) He’s done several things like that- suggested a gift that he wants to get me that needs to be scheduled but then doesn’t do it.  
So my birthday came, and then he went hunting for 5 days with our older sons and a bunch of other guys. He sent pictures of what they were doing and it seemed like a nice mini vacation for him. Meanwhile I am at home with the teen girls, the 10 yo, and the five little people. We were fine and nothing major happened but it wasn’t the greatest. He says he wants to take me to the hunting place during the summer. I’m not counting on it.  
I have since stopped going to my regular therapist bc I don’t feel like I was making much progress. He validated my feelings but really didn’t give me any insights or tools to get better. I’ve been finding things online from instagram and pinterest. My husband arranged for us to talk to our pastor and that was a disaster. He was asking about my family of origin and then asked “where do you see yourself in 5 years?” 
I can’t even see myself in one month! I wish I was dead by then or had a cancer diagnosis. But no, I’ll probably still be a SAHM with a 5 yr old and 10 yr old twins, and a teen. 
Still the mom, still the cook cleaner, and driver and everything else my husband wants me to be so he can go and do his thing of having a career and meeting people. I keep telling him that he needs to find a better wife. One who is smarter, prettier, happier and that wants to be there with him and all these kids. One who is intellectual and wants to play his card games
I know I’m not happy and I know I am depressed and I don’t want to be here. I’m not who he needs. 
We have a wedding to attend in February and I really don’t want to go. But he says I have to go. I don’t want to go bc I don’t want to see his family. And I don’t want to have to plan everyone’s suitcase and such. We have to travel 5 hours away for it and I just don’t want to go. 
This is just a rant. I don’t think anyone can help me. I don’t want any advice bc I’ve heard it all before. I just had to get my feelings out from this weekend.

314,"For what it's worth, I don't feel I had a particularly traumatic birth which makes me feel silly for saying I'm dealing with birth trauma, but I don't know what else to call it. I had a pretty straightforward, quick-ish (about 12 hours) vaginal birth and although there was some pretty bad tearing, I had an epidural and didn't even feel it happening. 

I just keep finding myself flashing back to being on that hospital bed in the delivery room, trying to push, everyone focused on me and yelling out instructions and reassurances. The level of exposure and vulnerability that comes with giving birth leaves me with a skin-crawling type of feeliing every time I think about it. My heart starts racing, it gets hard to breathe, and I find it difficult to focus on caring for my little girl.

317,"I'm extremely fortunate that I have a job that offers multiple shift patterns. Every year you have to apply to the top 3 patterns you want and you aren't guaranteed to get it, but it's still so nice to have the option.

When I returned from maternity leave in October of 2023, I went straight onto a Monday to Friday pattern. I applied to keep the pattern for 2024 and got it. It was nice because you get holidays and weekends off. I never had to worry about missing family events or my older kid's dance competitions.

But as the year went on, I deteriorated. Wake up, drive the kids to daycare, go to work, pick the kids up, dinner, bath, bed. Every day I got MAX 2 hours to myself. Which wasn't even really to myself because then my husband wanted attention and would get annoyed if I just wanted to scroll on my phone and veg out. I had literally zero waking moments 100% to myself to do what I wanted to do. I would get so fucking angry when people at work were like ""happy Friday!"" because I knew that my weekend was just going to be non stop chores and taking care of kids and continuing to get zero time to myself.

I had non stop fantasies about killing myself. I was barely eating or sleeping anymore. By the end of the year, I lost about 20-30lbs and had to tighten my belt to the smallest it could go. I would scare myself driving to and from work because I felt like I was physically holding myself back from crashing my car. 

After battling back and forth with myself, I decided to go back on shift work. I applied for a 4 on, 5 off position. That means two 12 hour days, two 12 hour nights, and then I get 5 days off. It was a hard decision to make because it meant working weekends and holidays and my husband would have to pick up a lot of the slack and I just felt selfish. But we're just under a month into the year, and I already feel like a weight has been lifted.

On my days off, I have enough time to get the chores done without kids hanging off of me and still plenty of time to just relax and do my own thing. Today, I was playing with my two year old and I was actually smiling and having fun. Maybe this sounds awful, but it's like working 4 days where I either don't see them at all or barely see them, makes me actually miss them and want to spend time with them. I don't feel burnt out.

318,"Hey everyone,

I created a Discord community for moms in all stages of the postpartum journey—whether you’re 6 weeks in or 6 years—and I’d love for you to join us.

This isn’t just another group; it’s a safe space where we can talk about the hard stuff: mental health, the postpartum experience, and the realities that don’t make it into the parenting books. It’s a place to vent, seek advice, join weekly/monthly mental health activities, and find genuine support from people who get it.

Postpartum mental health is often overlooked, and too many of us suffer in silence. Let’s change that. Together, we can create a village that uplifts and supports each other.

If this sounds like what you need—or if you just want to check it out—the link is below.

Hope to see you there �

319,"Hello everyone,

Long story short, I went through some fertility trauma/pregnancy loss late 2021, early 2022. I took a year off from trying to get my ""mind right"". I initially went through a deep wave of anxiety/depression for a month before it spiraled into these constant unwanted suicidal thoughts and images. At first, I thought I was having a near psychotic break because I never felt these feelings before, and they were constant. I tried Zoloft, and clomipramine, and they really didn't do anything for me. Prior to this fertility stuff, I was fortunate enough to never really experience anxiety or depression.

Long story short, over the years, they are still present, some days worse than others, but always there. I welcomed my double rainbow baby in late 2023, and was hoping they would stop but never really did. I decided to stop taking all meds due to great amount of weight gain and no real mental relief/benefits.

Over the last few months, I seem to have some struggles fertility wise again as things really aren't going my way with regards to it, however: I have been sleeping better and have had some really mentally calm downs. And now this week, they are really bad again. I love my family, I love my life, and I fear so badly that I will act on it one day out of feelings of hopelessness of never feeling better. I have normal energy, I try to work out and eat healthy every day, I go to work every day, I don't do any recreational drugs, and I rarely ever dink anymore.

Thoughts? I would love for these thoughts to just stop.",,"hello everyone

320,"My son studies my feet as we walk hand and finger through the hallways of our home, and it occurs to me to tell you—you will be OK.

It occurs to me that I should tell you from one mom to another. You will be OK even though now you are not OK, and it’s OK to not be OK.

Even though being OK seems a long way off and nigh impossible. Even still, you will be more than just OK. 

My son babbles something in an intelligible language. 

You will in fact be great.

Sooner than you think, the haze of newborn days will be behind you. Your child will cuddle and clap and stand and dance and laugh. He will conversationally mutter “up, up, up,” while holding your hand as you walk about the halls of your own home because it’s much too cold to go play outside like he really wants to.

It baffles me how one can go from being so very not OK to being more OK than they’ve ever been in the short span of a year, but trust me when I say—you will get there. 

Perhaps it will take longer—perhaps a shorter time—but there will come a day when you realize your hours are far more full of laughter than of tears, and in fact, you don’t remember the last time you cried in anything but joy.

The little hand that grips yours now by reflex will hold it out of trust. The voice that wails for you in the middle of the night will still wail for you in the middle of the night, but now you will know exactly what to do to calm it, and you will feel capable—not overwhelmed.

You will grow to be so much stronger than you ever dreamed you could be, and all for the love of a little person who looks to you as their everything when they are in fact YOUR everything.

You will want time to neither rush nor slow because you are so happy right where and when you are.

My son cruises around the coffee table and takes two brave, wobbly steps towards the couch.

You will know that these are the best days of your lives.

321,"PPD hit me like a train at around 5 months and got worse and worse until I literally feel each day that I’m hanging by a thread. That thread is my son who needs me more than anyone else does and I have to stay here for him, even though I picked out exactly how and where I would die. I can’t give up. It’s been so hard to keep myself together and it’s everything I can do to keep going to work every day and doing the things that I need to do. 

I feel like I’m failing at work and I’m failing at home and at my relationships with everyone including my partner. I feel like my son deserves much better than me but for him I try the hardest. At work I have told my boss how overwhelmed I feel. I lead a team of 14 people and that is an intense amount of direct reports, 3 of which need constant support as they are new in their positions. Yesterday I sent an email to my boss detailing that I need help managing my workload and developing better skills so that I can be better on top of things, I confided in her that I was being treated for PPD. She didn’t respond to my email. 

My bosses, bosses, boss, the leader of the facility that I work in came into my office and sat down and probably gave me most healing and understanding talk that I’d ever had. I don’t really know him, though we’ve worked around each other and I’ve worked indirectly for him for many years. He sat and he told me all about how much his partner struggled post partum, how she had PPD and PPR and how they didn’t take it seriously at first. He told me that everyone around me understands the massive change my body went through and no one thinks that I’m a failure for struggling. He said work should shape around my life and the most important thing was to care for myself. He said he couldn’t tell me how to get through the next 6 months, but that I was doing the right things by seeking treatment. It all meant a lot to me. I was apprehensive about reaching out to my boss because she’s always warned about being careful about optics. Reputation, how you look and how your leaders see you, all that is vitally important in the corporate setting. 

Not sure where I am going with this. Just sharing somewhere because I have so few people I can share with. This thing is so isolating, I feel paralyzed to reach out to anyone. It makes you believe that no one cares and everyone is frustrated when you aren’t yourself and maybe can’t do as much for them. But I think more people care than I know and they’d want to help if I just had the courage to reach out.

322,"progesterone levels are high during pregnancy coming from the placenta and after birth this production drops off a big amount. but some women might not produce progesterone well as a standard without the placenta support. when estrogen is relatively too high it creates vulnerability to stress (causes higher activity in the amygdala part of the brain) [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14569273/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14569273/)

A lot of women use progesterone post menopause to help symptoms. Getting a boost of bioidentical progesterone again (not the synthetic type progestins) might be worth a test to see if it helps postpartum

*""Under good conditions, the (premenstrual) luteal phase of the monthly cycle resembles pregnancy, as a period of progesterone dominance, in which the abundance of progesterone causes cells to decrease their estrogen content. The luteal phase is actually the first stage of pregnancy,*

*The sudden decrease of progesterone production before menstruation is similar to decrease of hormone production just before childbirth. The same conditions that produce the premenstrual syndrome, if they aren't corrected by the placenta's massive production of progesterone, will produce preeclampsia, toxemia of pregnancy, eclampsia, and postpartum depression. They are also related to the problems that become so common at menopause.*  
*Whenever the production of progesterone falls, tissues are susceptible to estrogen. There are several common causes of a progesterone deficiency. Deficiencies of thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol are often responsible for a progesterone deficiency. Inadequate light exposure can cause it. Excess polyunsaturated fats, interfering with gonads and thyroid, can cause it. And excess serotonin can cause it""* [https://wiki.chadnet.org/files/postpartum-prementstrual-and-seasonal-seotonin-soaks.pdf](https://wiki.chadnet.org/files/postpartum-prementstrual-and-seasonal-seotonin-soaks.pdf)

323,"I'm 2 months postpartum and I have been diagnosed with postpartum depression. Around 2 weeks after the baby was born, I started to feel a sense of dread every morning and not want to get out of bed. I started to get more anxious and small things were setting me off.

My baby got sick and was admitted to hospital for around 10 days. During this time, I was in the hospital with him and lost interest in eating, personal hygiene became difficult. Everything seemed too difficult, although I was getting more rest in the hospital than I would at home and I only had to feed and change my baby. 

I went into emergency at the same hospital and they diagnosed me with postpartum depression, but I keep feeling like it is not that. After coming home from the hospital, I had a burst of energy and got quite a lot done but I still wasn't interested in eating and personal hygiene was still difficult despite being at home. Whenever the baby cried, I would start shaking and just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. 

Everything feels like there are too many steps and it's too difficult. I have had postpartum depression and anxiety before and it was really bad, but I didn't feel this sense of confusion and slowness that I do this time. 

I haven't cooked in ages, whenever I go into the kitchen I start to feel scared and sometimes my hands shake whenever I'm faced with a task I need to do. I don't want to get out of bed in the mornings. I feel like I can't take on any new task, I can only repeat the things I know from before and a lot of those I can't do anymore. I'm anxious about ordering groceries because I will have to put them away. I'm anxious about putting food into a plate and eating it. When I'm given a plate of food, it feels too difficult to even sit and eat. I'm anxious about ordering diapers and baby clothes and formula. It all feels mentally taxing and draining and I can't explain that to anyone because they would think I'm crazy. I only look forward to sleeping because there's nothing to think about, but once I wake up it all starts again. 

Today my daughter had an accident in the washroom and my hands started shaking, I felt scared and genuinely felt like I did not want to live life anymore. It felt so difficult and I don't know why. 

My ferritin levels were low prior to my c section, but I checked recently and it is now in the fifties. I have been at 7 during pregnancy and I didn't feel this way. 

I feel isolated from everyone and I wonder how people can enjoy anything. I don't enjoy spending time with my kids or anyone else, I don't have much to say and prefer being alone. I feel so much sadness, as if I have lost everything and the person I was is gone. I find it difficult to move from one task to another and feel scared whenever I'm alone with my kids because I'll have to multi task and I can't seem to. I just want to run away from everything.

I was prescribed 50mg Zoloft and I am taking something for sleep too. I'm told the Zoloft hasn't kicked in yet and I have to wait until the two week mark.

I have read stories of postpartum depression and I don't see anybody struggling to function as much as I am right now.

My husband works long hours and some days he doesn’t get to see the baby at all. I put her to sleep every night and it takes usually an hour, and then I’m the one waking up with her all night since we co-sleep and I’m breastfeeding. I count down the hours for him to get home just for him to be late. I feel like I never get any breaks, we don’t have family or close friends nearby that I could trust with baby. 

Just tonight I went out with friends and I couldn’t even enjoy myself. I just feel so sad. I’m not sure what to do.

326,"How do you cope with negative thoughts that come with post partum depression. My mind keeps going back to how my husband sucks and essentially was selfish and abandoned me when I really needed him. He continues to abandon me by choosing to work a night shift even though I’ve told him I’m struggling and need help. He sleeps all day and I’m alone with the 6 month old and 2 year old. I don’t have family or friends that care. I feel alone, abandoned. I get angry at my husband and family and then I get overwhelmed and angry which spills over to my kids. I get irritable and don’t want to spend time with them because I’m already drained. I feel my husband creates a dark shadow around me. I have already tried to leave him last year but he kept harassing me and all of a sudden was father is the year wanting to see the 2 year old (6 month old wasn’t born yet) and demanding that I drop her off. I was worried he wouldn’t give her back to me so I always went along with the visits and he somehow weasels his way back into my life. Then the cycle repeats and I stupidly got pregnant again and he wanted me to abort the baby. He wasn’t supportive throughout pregnancy and left the childcare and cleaning to me of course while I was still working full time. I’ve been so depressed and tired. Then when the baby was born he sat in the chair and I had to tell him to help me. With both pregnancies I hired a doula to be there for me because I knew he wouldn’t help me. I was correct. He’s a selfish shitty person. I knew the second baby would be hard on my mental health because I knew he would be like this. And so here I am dealing with the consequences of my bad choices in choosing this stupid man. He has childhood trauma and untreated ADHD. He truly lacks empathy and has told me so. He says he only cares about me and that he “likes” the kids. I wonder if he only truly cares about me because he uses me. 

Last night I sent him a series of texts about my thoughts and feelings while he was at work and he basically kept working. I told him I fantasize about the peace that would come with death. He came home and went to sleep. Just further confirms that I’m alone and he’s a piece of shit. I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to my family because they already hate him from last year when I tried to leave him. If I talk to them them I’m just proving to them that I’m unfit to be a parent by staying with him. 

It’s too much effort to deal with him. I can’t rely on him yet I’m trapped with him. He also doesn’t even remember when our kids were born. He literally told me that it wasn’t a big deal to him because it wasn’t happening to him. He said he didn’t really care about the ordeal. I remember when I was in labour he didn’t try to help me. He got mad at me because he was tired. This stuff just plays through my head all the time.

I have a 4mo baby and a 5yo, just started working from home, and my baby is going through a sleep regression which I know it making everything worse. I told my husband on Tuesday of last week that it was a rough mental health day and he asked if there was anything he could do. I never know how to answer that when people ask lol. It’s like, no, but yes but I’m not sure what or how? Well anyway, he decided last week he was going to start working out after work and by the time he’s done, it’s dinner time and then bedtime for the girls. So it’s just me handling everything for the kids. I brought it up by the end of the week and he said “I didn’t realize it was that bad. You just handle it really well” and kind of dismissed it. I broke down because what choice do I have?? I told him I’m suffering mentally and life was a lot earlier in the week. I know he’s going through a lot right now with deaths in his family, other family issues, and work, so I didn’t push it any further. 

On top of that, I tried telling my uncle that I’m close with that I wasn’t doing well mentally. His response- “you’d never be able to tell. You’re always so on top of everything”. When I saw my friends last week they asked how me and the girls are. I told them the girls are great but things are a lot right now and I’m kind of going through it. They said “you’re a super mom. I don’t know how you do it every day.” I just want to yell IM NOT AND I CANT THATS WHAT IM TELLING YOU. I feel so dismissed. I’m trying to tell people who care about me that I’m struggling, but I feel like nobody listens unless I will straight up say I’m super depressed and anxious and have really bad thoughts. 

I am seeing a therapist and she was a huge support last week, but it’s not the same. I’m also on medication for PPD and PPA. It just seems like I’ve hit a bump in the road. But when I’m looking for support from the people who seem to care about it, there is no support. It’s not helpful to hear “super mom” and “you handle everything so well” because I’m literally not handling it well!!!! There’s no village anymore.

340,"I had my first baby September 29th 2024. The delivery was an induction and everything went well with the labor. At my 6 week appointment in November I broke down to my OB that I was feeling disconnected from the baby, crying at everything, not looking forward to anything, would find myself anxious and not laughing at anything my husband said or just jokes in general. Once I was in a weird mood it was so hard to get out of. She had recommended I try counseling, go on an SSRI like Lexapro, or try Zurzuvae. She explained to me that it is a fairly new drug. You only take it for 2 weeks ,and that it does make you drowsy. I opted to try the Zurzuvae. You have to take the medication with fat so I would take it at night with ice cream. My husband did those night shifts with the baby. The first few nights I felt really drowsy and dizzy. By the time I woke up I felt okay to care for the baby but definitely still tired. Eventually it wore off towards the end of taking the meds. I do feel like around the 3rd day of taking it I felt in a much better mood and then from there I have felt better mentally. I started to laugh again. I felt so much more connected to the baby. I would honestly recommend taking this medication to any woman who is struggling with postpartum depression. It really helped me and I liked the fact that you only had to take it for 2 weeks instead of being on it more long term. 

I am off the medication for 2 months now and I still feel pretty good mentally. I guess the only thing I noticed was that I have a lot of rage and anger that I didn’t have before pre pregnancy. It’s more near my period so I’m sure it’s just my hormones still being all over the place or just life circumstances right now. This doesn’t change my opinion on taking the medication because I would totally still recommend it. However, it makes me wonder if my anger is due to the medication being worn off or my hormones not being back to normal yet. I have started therapy and I also think that is helping as well with me learning how to cope with my anger. 

I am posting this to share my experience with this medication. If anyone has any questions about it feel free to ask!

The anxiety is so bad that I have no motivation to do anything when I used to love cleaning and doing things around the house. We have a two story house where the master is the only room downstairs and the rest are upstairs, so I never really went upstairs. Since my baby is still very little she’s gonna be downstairs with us until she’s big enough to go in her own room up there which won’t be for a while, but I feel like now I have a whole nother house to clean since l never had to worry about the upstairs.

Immediately, I returned to a complete shit show. Nobody’s fault, but I came back to 3 of my coworkers out on FMLA themselves. Wishing them all the best, as none of this is any of their faults or their problem.

Well, now it has turned into coming in at 5 in the morning every single day, which has put an enormous amount of stress on my babies, my partner, and my whole family. My husband does not have a set schedule at his job. Some nights, he’s not getting home until 10pm and other days he’s going in as early as 7am. Neither of us are getting any sleep.

When I expressed the emotional and physical toll this is taking on my family, I was told that this is my position and that this is what is expected of me. I have been refusing to come in at 5 some days and told them that I will be there at my normal 9am scheduled time because I do not have anybody to watch my babies that early some days.

351,"I have a toddler and a 2 month newborn (2 under 2). My sister in law has been living with us for one year and it is just having a negative impact on my marriage and now mental health. My husband is overly obsessed with his extended family in my opinion. My SIL comes from a mother country, despite having two kids and working my husband takes her to  school  every night at 7 and picks her up at 9 every night despite the fact that we live in a city where trains and buses are everywhere. 

She’s home all day during my maternity leave but cooks in the kitchen all day. I don’t know what for. Maybe boredom!  I do not eat those foods but my kitchen is ALWAYS occupied. Sometimes my baby only sleeps 30 minutes, with eduaobkwt pumping I need ro wash the bottles or pump and get things in the kitchen but she is always there!!!!! Crowding my space

Me and my husband barely have any time together due to him working and the kids. When we do have a few minutes together she never excuses herself to give us one time to eat in the kitchen or just to chat. In fact on a daily basis she tells my husbands stories of what happened with my toddler before I her a chance and then overallks and interiors our conversations regularly where I can’t get a word in. 
She stays in the kitchen with my husband while he cooks and I’m there too pumping and doesn’t remove herself, just talks to him in their language I can’t understand because she doesn’t speak English. 

She’s not hygienic, doesn’t take
Regular showers. Have to remind her to wash her hands so I don’t feel
Comfortable with her helping with the newborn in anyway, she helps with the toddler from Time to time 

My husband is so sensitive over his family when we talk about in the past,
it ends up explosive  and I have to walk on egg shell with feedback on his  family. We have been to therapy many times about other family members in the past that he had livinf with us:
He wants her to come to church with us and be 100% integrated  in our lives:  there is no plan for her to move out because he is  trying to find her a job but she has no skills and  can’t speak English. sometimes I feel like a third wheel I hate it here.

352,"I am a FTM 3wks pp and suffering from depression, anxiety, and so much rage that I can barely function on the daily since my husband went back to work. I think I have lingering trauma from my birth experience as well - I truly thought I was going to die while I was having my baby.

I try to meet my baby’s needs immediately, but she will scream bloody murder if I’m not fast enough and I get overwhelmed/overstimulated almost instantly. My husband says that babies cry for no reason and I can’t deal with the crying that just won’t stop. I’ve never done well with noises, I am sensitive to sound and have never coped well with it. I handle this by screaming back at my baby and then crying with guilt because she doesn’t deserve it. It’s a vicious cycle and I just don’t know how to stop it. Even putting her down in her crib in her room doesn’t help because our walls are so thin I can hear her shrieking. Then the anxiety of being away from her kicks in and I’m scared something will happen. I fear putting in headphones or ear plugs because how will I hear her if she starts to choke or something?

My pride won’t let me reach out for help either, and I know how stupid that is. My mentality is that I wanted to be a mother for so long, why am I so desperate to escape it? I feel like a failure if I need to ask for help. Which is also ridiculous because I feel like I’ve failed my daughter already. I gave up breastfeeding because it was too much and I am constantly on edge/stressed out. Pumping has become an absolute waste of time because my production (which was already low after a complicated birth) is now abysmal and it just makes me feel worse. I struggled to give myself any credit, any grace, any kindness before I got pregnant and it’s worsened tenfold since my daughter was born. I am so awful to myself.

I am overcome with emotions that are drowning me every day to the point that I want to end it all. I have an initial consult with a therapist in 6 days, but that feels like an eternity away. I have never been so mentally unwell in my entire life and I’m so scared that therapy won’t help me or that I’ll ruin my child. I don’t have fears of hurting her ever, but I do have a fear that my mental health will continue to plummet and I’ll hurt myself terribly. And no child needs a mom that is so at risk or that can’t find any joy in life. To make matters worse, my own mom died almost 8 months ago and I haven’t been able to heal from that. I miss her so much and I hate that I’ve had to go through this without her. 

Her dad is a godsend because he immediately takes over when he gets home and on the weekends, he does his best to listen and validate my feelings as I break down into a crying mess every night, he wishes so much that he didn’t have to go back to work so soon after our daughter came. He has encouraged me to go to therapy because we both know he isn’t a professional and not equipped to wrangle what I assume is PPD/PPA/PPR. I love my husband so much and I feel so lucky to have had a child with him, but I feel like my child deserves someone better to be her mom.

I just don’t know how to manage - how do you do it? How do you cope with these out of control feelings? How do you better acclimate to motherhood? Were there any resources or support groups that helped you get through? Was therapy enough? Did you need medication too? Looking for guidance, sympathy, or anything really.

I feel like I do have postpartum depression. I really really thought I wasn't. I was excited to be on leave with the LO and bond all throughout pregnancy. 

Now that I am about 6 weeks in I feel as if I destroyed my life and my partners. I miss the life before with my man and my cats. It was quiet and peaceful. 

Now my days are spent dealing with my baby who just screams and cries and refuses to settle. (Just got over a 3 hour session. We both cried and I excused myself to scream into a pillow). I've tried swings, bouncers, baby wearing, headphones, I went through the check list on a loop hungry, diaper, burp, check clothes, check temp. It all just eventually ends in him falling asleep from crying or screaming so much I guess

Doctors assume he's colic and will grow out of it. I am pumping since he couldn't latch due to my nipples being a little bumpy due to having neurofibromatosis. I feel sometimes it's my fault he's colicky because of my milk, but doctors say he doesn't have CMPA and don't recommend me changing my diet since he's gaining weight and is over all healthy.

He does everything in his power when home to help, but at that time I'm at the breaking point and I feel so bad for being short with him.

366,I gave birth in May to a beautiful baby boy. The pregnancy was relatively easy and something my husband and I both wanted and had been looking forward to for years. Fast forward to the birth. Everything went pretty well until I got to 9 cm at which point his heart started to drop. I was rushed into the OR for an emergency C section but ended up vaginally delivering instead after two hours of pushing. The recovery was slow but okay. I was proud of how I could handle the sleepless nights and other challenges. Then came going back to work. I don’t know if it was the stress of going back to work or working out but all of a sudden my pelvic floor went haywire. I could no longer properly use the bathroom and no one could diagnose me. This swung me into a deep depression and anxiety and I went from loving being a mom to wanting nothing to do with my baby.

But neither of us realised that by becoming parents ourselves, it literally cracks your psyche right open and all of your wonderful repressed childhood trauma spills right out. We have both been working on things and how we respond to situations and people and frustrations. He has realised his own parents were never there for him emotionally, never let him express emotion at all, lied to him, only made him feel worthy if he could do things for them and got treated like an absolute inconvenience. This has turned him into a people pleaser and he struggles to put himself first. His parents have the most dysfunctional relationship and his mother clearly doesn't get what she needs emotionally from his dad/ her husband and tries to fulfill that with her son (my partner). I never realised how controlling and self absorbed she was until I got pregnant and had my baby. She didn't ask how I was going basicly the entire pregnancy, when I laid out some fair and clear boundaries in the family group chat, she just laugh reacted it. My partner reluctantly invited her to the hospital a day after I gave birth just so she didn't get upset as my mum had been in quickly that same morning (my mum had helped me wash all the baby clothes, set up the nursery and baby sat my dog while in hospital in labour) and when visiting my MIL kissed my daughter on her head. I grabbed my baby back and was devastated. I spent that night in hospital holding my baby alone just sobbing all night long. After this when we got home she posted a photo on Facebook of my daughter after being asked not to (before I had posted) and when I asked her to remove it she said "" I guess I've just fucked up again"". Because of hormones and PPD and existing anxiety made worse by the hormones etc, I spent the first few weeks just sobbing and feeling so furious and betrayed. His dad is now so cold to me because his son (my partner) actually puts his own new family first and doesn't go building houses and doing jobs for his dad for free in his spare time. My partner runs his own business and not once has his family asked how it's all going. He started it in January last year and our daughter was born in April. He did it so I can be a stay at home mum. I had a good relationship with them prior to getting pregnant. - for context I've known mu partner 20 years and we have been together for 10 years. But yeah since I don't just go along with everything they say and my partner holds boundaries now they are cold and rude. My partner has told me horrible things his dad said to him growing up and now it all makes sense some of the mental impact it has had. I resent them both. Can anyone relate or have advice.

I tell you what, struggling with post partum depression and anxiety has been shit but it’s really showed me that I married the right person. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety and OCD since I was a child, and then started experiencing depression a bit later on. 

But ive never had a panic attack like this before. My hands and face were tingling, my chest felt like it was caving in, I felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

My husband is incredible and immediately jumped into action and tried a million different things but not much helped. I went and stood outside, took a shower, tried deep breathing with my husband guiding me, but nothing tackled it. 

So he went and found our cat who was sleeping in the window and that immediately calmed me down. Google also said if you’re struggling with breathing to cover your hand with your mouth and to breathe through your nose and that also helped. 

So I sat in the rocking chair in the nursery clutching our cat and covering my mouth and it immediately started winding down.

I luckily had a supportive husband, family friends and doctor who got me back into a sound headspace after 6 months. Now I  feel guilty about not enjoying those months with my child because every single day I wake up I can’t imagine a life without him or being his mom. I love nothing more in this life than being a mom. It’s crazy to me how complex our brains can be. To go from one end of the spectrum to another.


Jumping ahead a bit. 

My LO is approaching 2 and my husband and I are talking about having another. If it was up to him I would have been pregnant months ago but he is understanding that I am nervous and need time. there’s no pressure from him at all. He just loved being a dad haha.

I feel like I’m in such a wonderful spot now so I’m looking for advice from other moms who have struggled with PPD and have another child. I want a second but I am truly terrified of struggling again and now while taking care of a toddler. I don’t want him to see me the way I was. It’s truly been such a mental block for me to consider a second but in my heart and soul I know I want this.

Looking for any words of wisdom or advice here for anyone who has gone through a similar thought process. Hoping this is a safe space for opening up about this. It’s been difficult for me to speak about it.

377,"My husband (28M) and I (27F) just had a baby 9 months ago. He took such good care of me postpartum, he has always taken such good care of me. Our relationship has been nothing short of legendary. I have never felt a love like I have with him. (We’ve been together for 7 years married for almost 2.) 
After having our baby and him going back to work things have changed drastically. He doesn’t even know if he wants to be in this marriage anymore. I asked him on a scale of 1-10 if he wanted to save this marriage he said 5. He is a completely different person, it is so hard to accept and to even see him that way. I feel like I’m living in the twilight zone. This has been going on for a couple months now, he just keeps saying he doesn’t know what he wants. It is torture living in this house with him because I love him SO much and he literally doesn’t want to touch me, kiss me, barley will even say “I love you” and treats me like a friend. It’s excruciatingly painful I don’t even know what to do with myself. I know people say things get really rough in the first year of parenthood but this seems like more than that.. I’ve looked through his phone (which I’ve never done before this) multiple times and have found absolutely nothing, not even him liking girls photos so I don’t think he is being disloyal. What am I supposed to do? Do I give him space and let him heal whatever he needs to heal? Am I being neglected? Do I keep fighting to save us? I am so lost. I can’t even imagine a world in which we are not together but he seems like the only thing holding him back from wanting a divorce is our son. 


For more context, he works a VERY demanding job and I stay home. Staying home has been a huge transition for me as I went from making 6 figures to being a stay at home mom and not making my own money. I understand his job is really demanding physically and mentally, I really feel for him in that aspect. I have also been struggling though and have let my postpartum rage get the best of me at times and this is where this all started. There is so much distance between us now because neither of our needs are getting met. He said “if I really wanted to save this marriage I don’t think it would be hard but I just don’t know if I want that yet.” So what am I supposed to do? Wait around for him? I mean after all this is a marriage and I feel like fighting for it and white knuckling through it is what you’re supposed to do right? He isn’t mean to me, he’s very respectful and is still there for me but.. am I being a fool? Should I just call the marriage? I am so lost on what I’m supposed to do.

This child was also very difficult breastfeeding and she was reluctant to give it up. All this amounted to her having some pretty decent struggles and eventually admitting that she may have PPD. 

She started on anti-depressants or anxiety medicine over a year ago, but it has only helped a little bit. She has tried to come off of them a couple of times, but she can’t. The problem is, they are only sort of working. 

She is always talking about how stressed she is even when there is nothing to be stressed about, she is always tired (2 year old still having sleep issues is partially to blame), and she is rarely happy.

Where do I start...We have been married 7.5 years. Wife is 32, I am 36. We Have a 5 year old and almost 15 month old boys. Happy, healthy boys. 
My wife hates me and wants to divorce me. I didn't break down and cry when she had the conversation with me, because I've been having that conversation between us in my head every day for the past 8 months since she finally broke to me how she felt about me 8 months ago. I was pretty prepared, just dreading it. 8 months ago it all started out as a random text I sent to her in the middle of the work day that said, I want to figure out how to get closer to you. I was blind sided by her response which was, the more you try to get closer to me the more I'm going to push you away. That conversation continued for a long time, further explaining to me how terrible I am, how I failed her, how she felt abandoned after our first son, how she felt alone after our first son, and how all of that from 4 years ago made her the way she is today. There were other details to the convo. She had some good points. I could have been a better father the first time around, I was trying to figure fatherhood out, she wanted me to read her mind or the situation and just know what to do. I didn't all the time. We had all of those arguments 4 years ago, I would accept my failure, apologize, and try my best to be better and do a better job. I am continuously accepting my failures, apologizing, and trying to get better and improve myself. Well the conversation ended on a bad note. We obviously had problems and I had thought all these problems had been resolved in the past, but now they are back and to blame for how she was.  I suggested that we go to counseling. Her response was that she was not interested in doing that. I was crushed.
Back up to before we conceived our 2nd son. I thought we were happy. We just got done building a house. We finished the inside ourselves and I finished the basement almost right away. My wife started online schooling as a prerequisite for a program she was entering. She was stressed. I was doing my best to support her, watch our son as much as possible, i do all the cooking, and take care of the house upkeep and projects. Early on with our 1st child, I wasn't the best at changing diapers or giving baths. Once I realized my failure, I changed. Since then, I think I've been a good father, I at least actively try to be each and every day. I absolutely love my son. 

So we get pregnant with our 2nd. Everything seems fine and happy. She's excited to tell me, we're excited. Everything seemed fine until 3-4 months in to the pregnancy. Suddenly she started getting more distant with me.  She never let me come with her to any of her dr. Appts with our 2nd. I was there for every one with the first. She was more agitated, overall just less happy, and more stressed. Her online schooling didn't help. I tried my best to be with our oldest as much as I could to take as much load from her as possible. Our oldest at the time would wake up in the middle of the night and come jump into bed with us and we were so tired, we'd let him stay. We'll that wasn't working. We all had terrible nights sleep. Eventually I said this has to stop and I would take our son back to his bed every night and spend an hour getting him back to sleep so my wife could get her sleep. I tried to clean up the house more, rub her feet more. I was constantly asking her if she needed anything, are you okay, I love you, how are you feeling. I would always get very short answers saying I'm good, i don't need anything, and the very routine I love you you too. I didn't believe any of it was true but what could I do? I rubbed her feet as much as she'd let me or want me to. To shorten this up, I tried to be there for my wife as much as I could think how to. 

At this point I wasn't aware of post partum depression and the seriousness of it. Looking back now, this next experience could have played a role in what her ppd is though. She really wanted a girl. We go in to check, and it's a boy! My response was to laugh only because our 1st son is such an amazing little handful. Her reaction was disappointment initially before it just turned into acceptance. I didn't think too much about her reaction at the time.

Fast forward to delivery day. With our first son, when the midwife tossed him up on her chest, her reaction was pure shock, and happiness, and disbelief. All in a good way. When the midwife threw our 2nd up on her chest, i was teared up, but when I looked at her, she turned her face away from me and it was a look of pure anger. I can't in any way understand what it's like for a woman to give birth, but I was a little taken back by her reaction...

She only took 8 weeks maternity leave instead of 12 like she was allowed. She was worried about money. She wanted me to go back to work after taking 1 day off, so I did. My mother in law is retired and is a huge help whenever asked or needed, so I wasn't too worried. It was the same case for our 1st son.  I felt our marriage was getting better through maternity leave. I'd come home from work, try to change as many diapers as I could. I was still cooking every meal, playing with our oldest son, trying my best to care for my wife, tell her how good of a mom she was, asked to get her whatever she needed when breastfeeding, the list goes on. I took over completely baths for our oldest during her pregnancy, and after our 2nd was born, I continued that, and still do most today. We were getting back to laughing a bit more, flirting a bit more, touching more, hugging more, i was feeling better about us. When the last week of maternity leave hit, it was all over. Everything just went downhill. She won't text me anymore without me texting first, won't tell me I love  you unless I tell her first, she won't talk to me in person anymore unless I talk to her first. It seemed/seems like our entire marriage is solely on my shoulders. During our conversation 8 months ago, she told me that she's just angry all the time and everything makes her angry. This really took me back, so at that point I started looking in to ir and looked into ppd, ppr, and the phycosis part too. I didn't know of anything that would relate to ppp, but I was floored while researching that she had 70% of all the other symptoms. And then suddenly dots were connecting in my mind from incidents after our 1st was born too. She has also always suffered with depression and I was shocked to see how much more likely she is to getting ppd because of it. 

I've researched so much, learned so much. I've tried telling her I'm worried about her, only to get laughed at. I try to support her, ask her if anything is wrong, can I do anything. To no avail. I've told her if there's anything I can do to be a better husband and father to let me know....crickets. I try to take her on dates, not interested. Try to start watching a TV series with her like we used to do, not interested. Tried to have uplifting conversations, wouldn't participate. Cooked her her favorite meals, she didn't really appreciate them. I tried and tried and tried. She eventually told me that the only time she's happy is when she's alone and on her phone, mainly TikTok. I tried telling her that being alone was only going to make everything worse. It has. She disregarded it. I put our baby to bed every night, she puts our oldest to bed. As soon as she's done with bedtime, she goes straight to bed and I'm pretty much not allowed to come to bed unless it's after 10. She gets more sleep now than she ever has in her life, but yet she's exhausted and tired all the time. She's on her phone constantly. In front of me and while she's with our kids. She's lost a ton of weight and she's not trying to. She's skinnier than she ever has been since I've known her, and she's not trying to be. She'll switch her personality between me and the kids constantly throughout the day. From happy, to annoyed, back to happy, constantly.

Well our conversation early this week started with her saying we need to talk. Now we've never been good communicators, or good at conflict resolution. I've always wanted to be but it's hard because she responds in anger to so many things, i get scared to talk through so many things.
She started by telling me that I deserve to be loved by someone who can give me love. She built me up, how great I am and everything and I deserve so much more than what she can give me. And said that she's not that person, it's not in her, she doesn't have that anymore. I asked her why she doesn't, and then she goes into all of the reasons I'm such a terrible person and treated her terribly, and made her feel alone and abandoned, and this i why she feels the way she does. Tells me that we haven't been happy since before our oldest was born. I told her that's news to me and that's not true. I told her when I noticed things weren't good anymore. She looked puzzled. She told me it's not fair to the kids to have parents that are never happy and the only option she sees is that we need to seperate. I brought up ppd to her again as I had multiple times previously in the last year. She excused it and said that's not what I is. I pointed out very specific symptoms, she disregarded them. I asked her to do counseling with me. She said she wouldn't. And wouldn't give me a reason why. I told her that I loved her so much and that I wouldn't quit fighting for her. She told me I needed to respect her decision, and that was the end of the conversation.

There are so many details I left out of this long post. I live my wife so much. I don't want to lose her. I'm 95% sure this is ppd, but she has me second guessing if maybe I am just that terrible of a person. I don't think I am? All of her family notices how well I treat her and how she doesn't really reciprocate very well. I'm not trying to trash my wife. I'm just trying to detail what's been going on. How do I help my wife when she doesn't want to be helped and when she doesn't think she has a problem? Does she have ppd? How do I support her. Does everything have to fall apart for anything to get better? I'm a lost husband trying to hang on right now. I want my wife back. We used to be happy. Now it seems like everything has fallen apart.",,"long post sorry hope someone read

I'm currently 10 days pp, and having an extremely bad morning. I just had my second baby and going through what I believe to the baby blues..

With my first son, I want to say I had severe postpartum anxiety that cleared up by the 2 week mark. I can't remember exactly when, but it was time for my two week appt with my provider to check on my incision, I remember distinctly having a conversation with her about how I had the blues but was feeling better. I remember being up 24/7 crying all the time and refusing to sleep eat or do anything outside of take care of my son bc of how awful the anxiety was & I think it was so awful because of the lack of sleep..

About 5 days postpartum partum this time, it hit me like a truck the same way it did with my first. I felt like I had ice or fire in my body and just cried because hated the way I felt. I kept replaying how I felt with my son and how awful it was.. The previous days, I would weep only when the sun went down and then after that I would be okay. After the 5th day, when I forced myself to get some sleep, I felt much better..I had some anxiety that lingered, and quite honestly at 8 days pp, I had SUCH a great day that I thought it finally ended for me. It came back slightly the next day but nothing severe. All of a sudden this morning at 6am it hit me again, and the anxiety is coursing through me and hasn't let up. I tried to sleep and for a whole hour I just was in and out of sleep waking myself back up with anxiety, it was awful... I know I've been through this before with my first, in the exact same way, I know that it passed, but had anyone else suffered with the baby blues really badly and it ended by the two weeks?? I'm so terrified this won't end soon and might take longer. I think having a timeline in my head makes it worse bc I expect to feel better by then.

The reason I'm thinking this is just the blues is because I developed a form of postpartum depression with my first a few months after he was born... and it was significantly less extreme. I would get sad and cry, but it never kept me up at night or gave me severe anxiety. And the fact that I dealt with this exactly the same as with him..",,"

395,"Hi my fellow moms. I’m a first time mom (30 years old F) with a previous history of anxiety and panic disorder. I’ve always wanted a family, and a baby and suffered a miscarriage last year around October which broke me. Me and my husband tried again and a few months later in Feb I found out I was pregnant again. I was so excited and surprised at the time since I had no pregnancy symptoms compared to my first. Fast forward a few months in the pregnancy, I remember taking a shower and feeling panic over the thought of being pregnant and having such a huge responsibility of caring for someone and being a mom. I had a panic attack but my husband held me and reassured me it’s ok to feel this way and that I’d be a great mom. Long story short the pregnancy was not easy. I had horrible pelvic girdle pain and back pain, had to leave my job which left us a financial strain, and unaware to me has elevated my anxiety to a whole other level. 

Now 6 weeks postpartum out of nowhere I started experiencing very dark intrusive thoughts of harm OCD and compulsion and urges. Things that just don’t make sense to me considering I wanted a baby and everyone who knows me has always said I’d be an amazing mom. I would look at my son and visualize him not there or harming myself (which I would never do) and then my anxiety kicks in and I would feel a loss of control and even more panic attacks. I feel depressed, anxious all the time, I don’t eat, I’m scared to be around my child at times, as if I’m a liability or a danger and I can’t seem to understand why this is happening to me. A few weeks ago I was happy, never occurred to me having these intrusive thoughts, happy to have a family and already talking about more kids with my husband and now I feel lost. I spoke to my husband about all this, and went to see my Ob and was prescribed Zoloft. I’m not a medication type of person, never been on any meds always just dealt with my anxiety disorder and was wondering if anyone else experienced this and if the medication helped? Asking for some reassuring words on here from other moms who may have been in similar situations or having a hard time adjusting or experiencing harm ocd and how it was managed and that everything will be ok. Thank you and sending much love.

398,"Hey all, 

I just finished Zurzurvae two nights ago to treat moderate-severe postpartum depression and anxiety. Prior to taking this I took one dose of Zoloft and it gave me tremors, suicidal thoughts (with no plans), rocking back and forth uncontrollably and insomnia. Before I took the one dose I had tremors here and there and insomnia with some crying. With the Zoloft if I tried to cry it would turn into a laugh. 

The Zurzurvae worked well for me for the 14 days more or less. I still cried here or there but it was controllable for the most part. 


Now that I’m two days off I’m back to chest pain, tremors, panic attacks with random crying fits and just feeling in a hole. Throughout the day I’ll have moments I’m ok but moments where I breakdown. I have an incredible support system. However, my in-laws are going to be leaving in less than a month and I need to get this under control before they leave so my husband isn’t dealing with this alone. 

I have a call with my psychiatrist in 2 weeks to decide if I should be on a longer term medicine (I am terrified and have been trying to avoid this but don’t think I have much of a choice). 

For context I’m 5 weeks postpartum and have historically been able to manage mild anxiety through talk therapy but this is a new level. The thing freaking me out the most aside from my brain not feeling like it’s mine is all the aches and pains I have being described as normal (aside from the postpartum preeclampsia I had). 

My deepest wish was the Zurzurvae would be all that I need but it doesn’t seem to be the case. Any advice or hope is welcome (medicine related or not). ",,"hey

399,"We have a 3 yo autistic and 1 yo. We moved countries because of economy, he had to go back to the country we moved from to get a visa because evn tho we got married and had children in the country we moved to (home country) the first time visa to stay as a family member has to be done outside of the country. 

He promised He would be back, we were having some issues having a deep connection with all the changes in 2024 and some history and me being focused on being the breadwinner and he the househusband.. everything was fine until 18 days after he left when he started having doubts and asking for time and I was like ""you are away for 3 months how much time do you need"".. and it all came to a stop a few days ago when he cancelled the return ticket I bought because ""he doesn't want to feel pressured about having a deadline to figure himself out""

He is stuck at a deadend job that doesn't even give him enough to live on his own in the country he is in. The child support we have agreed on doesn't cover half of our kids and I had to fight because he wanted to give way way less.. school alone for them is $620 per month. At least that's what I got from him now.. instead of 300 he wanted to send. He only makes 1200 a month, he won't work extra... he was being the main caregiver and he just blindsided me and abandoned us

He doesn't want to give me a divorce because it causes him anxiety to think about it right now, and he hasn't asked much about the kids since I stopped sending updates and waiting for him to ask since 3 days ago.

And I can't leave this country because he didn't gave me any notarized power because he was supposed to come back...

404,"I had my son (my fourth child) last June, and was diagnosed with “major depressive disorder” in August. They put me on Zoloft and it ended up making my life a living nightmare. After nine days of trying to “push through”, I got off of it and decided I would just try to fix myself without medication. 

Over the next several weeks I ended up spiraling deeper into the depression and anxiety. Fast forward to October and my OBGYN diagnosed me with PPD/PPA that was on the severe end of the spectrum. 

She put me on Lexapro and it started to make life easier. It also calmed down the panic attacks and helped bring my appetite back (I’d been losing weight very rapidly). 

I’m now 7 months PP and still struggling. I’ve been on the Lexapro for three solid months. And while it has helped improve my quality of life, I feel like my mind is still very unwell.
Every day I’m battling suicidal thoughts and obsessive thoughts about losing the people I love (my husband, my children, and my mom).

My thoughts are very dark. And I feel very fragile…as if one painful event would be my undoing. It’s been a tough two years. My husband is battling cancer, my baby was born with a heart defect, and I found out I was in the precancerous stages of cervical cancer when I was 6 weeks PP.

But nothing has compared to this pain.
I feel broken and scared that things aren’t going to get better. 

With all that being said, my doctor mentioned that if the Lexapro didn’t help me, we could add in an antipsychotic medication on top of the antidepressant.

I’m so scared. I was already very hesitant to get on the antidepressant (several of my family members have a history of alcohol/medication abuse and I’ve always tried to avoid medicine). 
I don’t want to get on a second medication but I don’t know what else to do.

I was meeting with two counselors (at different times) but I’ve had to switch twice for various reasons. I’m currently waiting to meet with a new counselor on Friday.

Has anyone had to take an antipsychotic on top of the antidepressant? I would love to hear your stories.

405,"I just need some reassurance that things get better. 

I’m seven weeks postpartum and I’m only now starting to feel some sort of hopelessness. I struggled with emotion regulation during pregnancy and never felt joy of being pregnant among the difficult symptoms that came with pregnancy. 

There was a lot of change that happened all at once. My boyfriend moved in after a year of dating and I immediately got pregnant. I’m diagnosed with ADHD and mild OCD. Medications stopped once I found out I was pregnant and I struggled with control which caused arguments with my boyfriend. I will say that he tried hard to limit these arguments and most of them were started from me. I’ll take accountability for a lot of our arguments but I felt like I couldn’t control when I got controlling and angry. I tried and looking back, I could have tried harder. 

Our baby girl is amazing. I never experienced a love like I did when I first looked into her eyes and she was placed in my arms. I would die for this little human. I felt like I did well with recovery and up until this point but arguments between my boyfriend and I are more intense than they’ve ever been. 

I know it’s adjustment for both of us. Finical responsibility has fallen on him and care for our child is mainly on me. I knew this would be the case and prepared as best as I could. A reoccurring argument that gets brought up is I’m not making him feel appreciated and loved in our relationship. I have a different love language than he does and I think that’s the cause. It’s been so reiterated that when I try, it falls on deaf ears and I know that’s my fault. 

Our lives changed and mine changed long before his did. I was the one who dealt with the emotional and physical changes from the beginning while he got to keep his normal life a little bit longer. I’m struggling with being stuck at home with no source of socializing. It’s really taking a toll and I miss being able to get out of the house without packing up a baby and considering her naps and now long I’m out. 

I know I don’t do enough to reassure my boyfriend and sometimes I don’t take into consideration how his life has changed and focus on just on my feelings. There are other things happening that would take too long to get into but I need someone to tell me this passes. I don’t want to break up with him and it has never crossed my mind but he brings it up sometimes. Whether he means he wants to leave or not, it just brings me down when he does bring it up. He says he doesn’t want to leave but I can’t help but think he does when he says it. 

I don’t know how to express I appreciate him in the way he wants. I have a lot emotions I’m trying to work through and I feel like making sure our baby is taken care of is my top priority. I’m emotionally spent. I feel like he thinks I’m using this as an excuse and don’t understand what he’s dealing with too. I do. I wouldn’t have paid less attention to protection if I didn’t feel like he was worth having a baby with. 

I want to try to better but he doesn’t accept my tries because of our past. I’ve explained all of this to him and it still causes issues. All the pent up emotions are just overwhelming and I’ve cried for the last couple days. I don’t think I’m at the point where I need to schedule an appointment to discuss alternatives but maybe I am. 

Has anyone dealt with this? What were the outcomes and things you’ve done to make things better? How do I not get some emotional and what can we do to move forward. Cause right now we either go backwards or at a stalemate with arguments. ",,"need reassurance thing get well

I hope it’s okay to share this here—I’m a third-year film production university student currently producing my graduate short film, *Matrescence*. The film tells the story of a new mother struggling with postnatal depression, and our goal is to raise awareness and help break the silence and stigma around this incredibly important issue.

We’ve spent a lot of time researching and consulting to ensure we tell this story authentically and with care. Our team feels so strongly about shedding light on this subject, especially as it’s something that many mothers experience but often feel unable to talk about.

We’re currently crowdfunding to help make the film a reality, and if anyone is interested, you can read more about our project [here](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/matrescence). Even if donating isn’t something you’re able to do, sharing the campaign or offering feedback would mean the world to us.

Thank you so much for letting me share this with you, and if anyone has experiences or insights they’d like to share, I’d love to hear them—our priority is to portray postnatal depression as truthfully as possible.

415,"Update: 

Please read anything here if it adds to your data in search for Zurzuvae info. But my case was complicated by a quick benzo taper (8 days taper after 1 year treatment on them), and I couldn't figure out if I was headed for the mental hospital due to withdrawal from benzodiazapines on top of untreated severe panic disorder, or the Zurzuvae, or both. 
As of yesterday, day 6, I did not take the Zurzuvae night dose and don't plan to anymore. My panic attacks on day 5 were Soo severe I was going to be landing in an ER. I decided to go to a slower benzo taper and see where I'm at after that (which will take a lot of time.)

Good luck to all struggling with PPD. I wish I could've given a full picture that wasn't too complex. But my case was too wacky to get a clear look at whether Zurzuvae was beneficial or harmful or what. 


Original post:
Hi! I used to ravenously look around Reddit for experiences with Zurzuvae and came across a few posts that spelled out their experience. I thought I would contribute. I started Zurzuvae yesterday.

I can put real updates as each day goes along. The first thing I noticed is that both myself and my breastfed baby slept extremely deeply last night. 

I also noticed that, despite feeling tired from it, I have this pretty defined boost in mood and a sense of ability to just do things rather than get really dramatic about how hard they are how bad at them I am lol.

That could be a placebo effect, I just don’t know yet.

As soon as my baby woke up, she said a few words in order and this is the first time she’s spoken that way: she’s eight months old. She said very distinctly hello mom, and when I took her in to see her dad, she also said hi dad. kind of freaky! I need to note something controversial here. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder which I started being treated with benzodiazapines in my pregnancy about exactly a year ago. I just did a benzodiazepine taper this past week. This means that my baby's receptors are also going through a withdrawal of some kind just like mine are. The thing about Zurzuvae is that what it does is: it enhances the GABA effect in the brain in and on the same GABA receptors both extracellular and intracellular as benzodiazepines. But it up-regulates these receptors rather than down -regulates them. Part of why I decided to taper off of that class of medication for anxiety is because it had down- regulated my receptors so much that I had to keep increasing the dose of medication in order to control my anxiety levels, and it just felt like there was no end in sight to these increases. I wanted out. So that taper ended two days ago and I was feeling it. It did not feel good. But after taking Zurzuvae, the withdrawal feelings lightened considerably. For the first time in a year, I didn’t wake up with heart, palpitations, and anxiety. We’ll see where this goes! I know that a lot of people had ups and downs with this medicine. They would have really good days and then they’d have a really bad day. So, I am trying to remain neutral and not hope for too much.


Update edit: 3.5 days in
Below you will see a rant on how I was going to stop this medication due to feeling it triggered an outbreak of herpes simplex one. I spoke at great length with my Doctor Who spent actually quite a bit of time looking up the validity of whether or not this medication could’ve triggered such an outbreak. There’s actually a study done that this type of pregnelonone can be more anti viral with this virus if it’s resistant to typical anti virals. She convinced me to keep going but to take high dose Valtrex to get the infection under control. I’m here to say it seems to be working!! I asked my pharmacy to refill the valtrex generic I was taking with a different generic company and that seems to have done the trick. The generic I was on is notorious for being ineffectual so I switched and the medication worked to put my cold sore outbreak into remission.

I’ll continue to provide updates.
Notably, my baby has a cold and is 8.5 months old. This is the first time she’s ever gotten sick. I leave it to the unwritten history of the present and future to come to the conclusion whether scientifically her immune system is negatively impacted by the Zurzuvae in my milk.



2.5 days into treatment:
I am going to discontinue this medication. The reason for this is not because of how it makes me “feel” psychologically. I think it was actually helping me a lot in that way, doing a lot for me in terms of helping the glutamate in my brain and Helping me feel even -tempered. The reason I’m stopping is because apparently since it’s a steroid, it has caused an enormous outbreak of herpes (oral )on my mouth, which no amount of antiviral is stopping. Since a child, even one pill of valacyclovir has caused a cold sore to start to recede. I have taken four doses of this treatment and The cold sores are only spread spreading faster and more painfully. This hasn’t happened to me since I was eight years old and I didn’t have any type of treatment to stop the outbreak. Having this is extremely dangerous for my eight month old baby. And she’s getting this Neurosteroid through my milk as well as being exposed to the herpes virus. I’ve had two outbreak since she was born and was able to stop the attack within hours by taking my prescribed antiviral pill. This is now 2 days Without improvement. The cold sore on my lip appeared within five hours of taking my first dose of  Zurzuvae. ",,"update

424,"My little lady recently turned 4 months old. She’s perfect. In every way. It’s hard for me to say anything beyond that about her. 
I’ve become quite jealous of the amount of sleep she gets. If only I could sleep for that long, uninterrupted. 
I had a pretty rough pregnancy, being put under short term disability for the last few months of pregnancy as my job is quite active and difficult as a large pregnant woman. I was induced at 39w2d and was then forced to have a C-section the next day due to infection. I was in and out of the hospital for the following month due to infections and incompetencies in the hospital I gave birth in. Luckily, my husband was there to help me (for the most part). 
The following month, right before my 8 week leave was up, my husband had a major back surgery, which brought his father to stay with us for his 6 week healing process. Little needs to be said, other than at that point, I had to not only care for my baby, I also had to care for my husband and his father. While working 12 hour shifts, 4 days a week. 
I’d wake up at 430am, feed the baby, clean the house, prepare dinner for that night, and make sure that everything was in perfect order so that I wouldn’t have to do a lot when I got home. But yet, somehow, even though I had made sure that the house was clean, I’d come back to the same mess as before. (And continue that on rotation for 6 full weeks). 
Finally, after my husband had started to feel better, I could see that he was actively trying to make it easier for me. Unfortunately, his father didn’t feel the same way. I’d come home after my 12, and he’d want a congratulatory cookie as ‘he put the spoon in the dishwasher’. I dealt with it. 
As thanksgiving rolled around, he was still at the house. We went to my brother in laws. With my husband still healing, it’s hard for him to transverse stairs- especially with large dogs attempting to also go up and down the stairs. We agreed to go on the condition the dogs aren’t going to be in the way to trip over. We felt we weren’t listened to, as dinner was held in the basement, with the 8 dogs that were at the house. 
We brought the baby and my father in law had asked to have a picture of his grandchildren. In the beginning, I had told him no. I don’t want the boys (7yr & 5yr) to be holding my (at the time) 2 month old. She is small, fragile and can easily be hurt or sick. 
This was brought up again right around Christmas. I caught a slight attitude because he calls my daughter (whom has a beautiful name and lots of nicknames that could be made from it) he calls her TINK. I told him to use her name. A version of her name. There’s plenty. I am now (according to my FIL) somehow the worst person in the world because I wouldn’t allow my daughter to be called something so offensive to people. But no, it’s “a term of endearment” for him. No, it’s offensive and rude that you can’t respect my daughter’s name enough to even call her by it. He also told me that I needed to respect him more as my FIL. I bit my tongue, as I’ve cut off my parents due to the same lack of respect for me as a human adult, an individual.- and he brought up how “they never do anything for me like HIS family does”. I’ve accepted that my parents aren’t in my life, they are toxic people. At the same rate, I’m not the person that is telling my husband to cut off his family. I DONT want him to lose his family in the same way I’ve lost mine. 
I’ve done everything in my power to be the best wife and mother I know how to be. But yet, somehow, I feel as if I’m not doing enough.

I have a history of clots in my pregnancies due to a clotting factor FVL. I’ve had DVT and pulmonary embolisms in both my prior pregnancies. I’ve had the same high risk OB throughout all my pregnancies. My last pregnancy (he’s 9 months old now) was absolutely traumatic. I followed the same OB. She knows my history and even specializes in clotting factors in pregnancy. I had very painful contractions that would show up on the monitor throughout my entire pregnancy. My OB blew me off and even sent me to a social worker because of how often I’d call to get checked out because of my contractions and severe back pain. The point of the social worker was to put together a “trauma plan” because of being gaslit in the past during pregnancy (they missed the dvt and PE in my prior pregnancies) so I had a lot of PTSD… I ended up hemorrhaging in the middle of the night and was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital that was not affiliated by the OB I was following. It was very scary but thankfully me and baby were safe as I delivered 4 weeks early. they suspected an abruption the entire time but confirmed during a pathology exam of the placenta after delivery including a clot in the placenta…. My baby and I are safe which is ALL that matters.. I’m angry. I’m very upset I was gaslit and not monitored more closely. Should I bother to contact a lawyer for negligence on the OB part?

432,"STM mom here with a 6 week old and a 2 year old.  I was on the fence about having a second after having a difficult first born who I love with all my heart.  She was colicky in the beginning and I fell badly into PPD because of it.

Unfortunately my second born also has colic.  Except this time it’s a night.  My first was during day.  Idk what is worse.  At night you’re stuck- just you and your partner.  Our daughter cries and is plagued with painful gas from the early evening and on.  I tend to break around midnight and make my husband step in while I go cry in the car.  I won’t get into how much we have tried in order to improve this.  Numerous doctor visits, lactation consultant, formula, breast milk, bottles, nursing.. following wake windows, not letting naps go super long, offering full feeds, etc. Not to mention tons of Mylicon and gripe water.  If someone tells me to try gas drops again I am going to scream. 

Things are so bad now I’ve almost given up tracking anything now.  I feel helpless.  As a last ditch effort I am taking her to a pediatric chiropractor and also set up a consult to get her posterior tongue tie and lip tie released.  It’s a lot of $$ but I am desperate for her to start sleeping at night and tired of seeing her in pain with the gas and digestive issues.  

I can’t believe I have put myself through this again.  We had enough on our plate with our first born.  I am total anxiety ridden right now and have an appt next week for my 6 week follow up.

440,"This was a much wanted pregnancy after IVF/a hellish journey to get here. 

I am grateful for my son but honestly, when I found out the gender at 3 months pregnant, I was heartbroken; I have experienced so much male violence/SA in my life, and have been scarred by misogyny, that I just couldn’t imagine raising a son. Not to mention having an estranged relationship with my own mother, I wanted to recreate a positive mother daughter bond so badly. I have so many negative associations about teenage boys, patriarchy etc. So much of my identity revolves around being an empowered woman in an industry often dominated by men. So bringing one into the world felt really hard.

The mother-son bond seems weirdly discouraged by society (see r/JUSTNOMIL). So I feel scared I’ll not have an enduring relationship with him anyway, and have no positive template for this.

Everyone said I’d feel differently when the baby was here but if anything, I feel worse. I am on the verge of tears whenever I see a mother daughter relationship on TV, or walk past girly things in shops. I know it sounds shallow but it feels like a dream has gone and I’m now in scary territory.

I’ve been on Zoloft for just under 2 weeks, and had therapy throughout pregnancy, but nothing is working. I feel so resentful of people who “got their preferred gender”. My baby deserves better, but I almost fear bonding with him as so many men grow up to hate their mothers that I feel downright helpless.

I also feel like part of my own girlhood has died bizarrely, like I can’t even fully relate to being a woman anymore if I have borne a son. 

I think going through infertility and IVF really fucked up my brain and made me covet anything others have that I don’t, which has now applied itself to gender.

Any advice, or positive experiences of raising sons?

443,"My son is almost 5 months old. But it has felt like years. These have been the hardest, worst 5 months of my life. And I’ve been through some things in my 32 years. 
5 months of feeling like every day is hell. Every night is hell. I don’t get a minute to myself. To be me. 

My whole life Ive been rather indecisive. But I always KNEW that I wanted to be a mom. I was always excited to have kids. To raise them. To have a family. I didn’t rush it, but was always excited for that stage in life. I’ve never been a huge baby person, but I love actual kids. But I figured if it was my own baby, I’d feel differently. 

I have PPD. But this depression goes beyond that. It is also situational. 
My pregnancy was difficult. I had every bad symptom in the book. I hated being pregnant. My delivery was terribly excruciating. 
Then, my newborn was extremely colicky and had reflux. The colic has finally started to die down, but, though he is smiley and cheeky, he is still very fussy. This is not one of these lovely unicorn babies you hear about with an easy temperament. I have spent every day since his birth trying to keep him entertained and not crying/screaming. 
The days we’re finally starting to get easier, and then the nights went to shit as the four month regression hit hard. My baby is up every 45mins to 1.5 hours. And will not, no matter what we try, go to sleep before 10pm and will always be up by 7am. I know if I even had an hour or two in the evening and morning to just be me and do my things and spend some time with my husband, everything would be different. 
I wanted this so bad but now that it’s here I feel like I’ve ruined my life. I had an amazing job that was my whole life and identity and was my community and second family. I had passion projects and friends and enthusiasm and a life. Now I have nothing. I’m stuck in the house all day with a screaming baby. I’ve never felt so dark and so bleak. I love my son, and am forever grateful for him, but I just want to feel somewhat alive again. 

If you had PPD or a similar experience, does it actually get better? Did you look back a year later and truly wish you could go back and tell yourself how great it gets? 
I could really use some success stories right now as I feel this desperate hopelessness.

Struggling deeply and profoundly at 7 weeks pp. I had such an amazing pregnancy, and was so excited to start this new chapter with my husband. All those feelings evaporated after my birth experience. I labored for 20 hours, developed an infection called chorio, and had to have an emergency c section.

I suddenly feel insecure and like any woman would be better than me for both my baby and husband. Since my mom died, I isolated myself over the years and I’m entering motherhood with borderline no friends and also a very shitty support network. I’ve never been so low in my life.

447,"I wanted to post my experience with Zurzuvae since when I was researching about it I could not find anyone who had taken it for the complete two weeks and had any update on how they felt after. I took it for two weeks and it has been a month since I have taken it. 

**Background** 
I am 30 years old and I had a healthy easy pregnancy and a positive delivery. I felt a slight sense of depression when I got home. I felt overwhelmed and I felt like at night I would get the night scares. I also was very tired and the lack of sleep really got to me. His cries made me what to shut down, but at the same time felt my heart racing. The witching hour/purple cry really got to me and I could not care for my son for two days I remained in bed and did not leave it. 
My OB does 2 week postpartum checks as well as 6 week postpartum check. At the 2 week appointment I took the depression survey and as soon as I saw her started tearing up and she told me I was moderately depressed and rx zoloft. I took zoloft for a month and felt like it did nothing so I stopped it. I continued to be depressed, but high functioning and tried to suppress it. Then I rejoined therapy and was told about Zurzuvae which I was interested in once she told me it was only a two weeks treatment. 

**The process of obtaining Zurzuvae**
My therapist reached out to my OB who then asked to see me. When I saw her she talked to me about the side effects the main one being central nervous system depression. She recommended I do not work for two weeks since I am a nurse and to definitely not to drive for two weeks and informed me to take the medication with high fat dinner at night. 

Once I decided to go ahead and take it. I made arrangements to have my mom fly in from out of state to help me and my husband took time off/wfh to help as well. I got the prescription and had my insurance cover it since it is a specialty drug it cannot be picked up at your local pharmacy. In my case it was the specialty cvs and they mail it to your house. This is the part that I wish someone had told me **from getting the rx to me having it in my hands it took 1 week** so in my case my mom had to stay an extra week because I did not have the drug. I just assumed I could pick it up the next day. 

It also cost me $5,000 with my copay! But when I called they told me the manufacturer discount would bring it down to $0! So make sure you talk to your insurance/pharmacy. 

**Taking the drug**
I took it at night with a high fat dinner (eggs, salmon, avocado etc) and I would take it around 8 pm after putting my son to sleep. The first night it made me drowsy and I fell asleep after 30 mins. The feeling of the medication throughout the two weeks makes you feel like you are drunk (hence the no driving and working). It made me feel drunk during the day and dizzy probably until 1 pm and I did not feel like myself until 4 pm. I did not work for two weeks because I am a nurse, but even if I was not I do not think I could work and function regardless. I went to an orientation for 3 hours for work and I felt like the powerpoint presentation were going fast, but I was being slow. I felt like everything was going quickly and I was going in slow motion and just felt dumb to be honest. I drove a short distance 5 mins on day 13 in the afternoon and I felt so confident that I could drive and once I did drive I was like this is not safe. So please do not drive on this medication. 

**Did it work?**
Day 1-2: I felt like my depression got worst. I was crying 2-3x a day which I had not done in a while. I felt like a failure for taking this drug and felt like a burden to my husband and my mom for taking time off and flying in to help me. I felt sorry for my son for having a mom like me and just cried looking at me. 
Day 3-7: I just felt the same way I felt before the medication. Depressed but highly functional not like day 1-2 where I was truly the deepest depressed I have ever been. 
Day 8: This is the day that it hit me that I did not have that feeling or voice of depression. It had quiet down. I felt a sense of relieve, but at the same time was worried that this feeling was fake and my mind was playing games with me. 
Day 9-14: I consistently felt the feeling of getting better and it  plateau to a constant feeling of normality and that voice and anxiety had decreased. 

**Final thoughts/updates a month out**
I think it was worth it and it saved me. I was moderately depressed, yet highly functional. I felt a sense of doom and did not enjoy my son to be honest. Now after taking the medication I feel kind of a sense of being robbed of time since I took the medication postpartum 9 months. I look back at photos of my son when he was younger and feel like I could have enjoyed it if I did not have the depression. 
It truly felt like night and day for me now. I find enjoyment in being a mother and feel like I only made myself more miserable by not seeking more help before. 
Now when things happen I am not spiraling or getting mad. My husband is no longer tip toeing around me to make sure nothing triggers me. No when things happen with my son that would have easily upset me before does not affect me. I just breathe through it and I am able to power through. This is when I knew the medication had worked. I had this fear of the what if it doesn’t work? What if I had my mom fly in and my husband to take time off only for it to not work? But that is when my husband told me what if it does? And if it doesn’t we will find something else. But in the end it did. I am glad I was able to finish the treatment as it truly did help me. 

**please feel free to message me if you have questions. You are not alone and you are a great mother**

448,I’m having a hard time connecting with my husband after having our daughter. He’s counted how many times we’ve had sex this year and constantly reminds me bc it hasn’t been a lot. But I don’t really have a sex drive and when we do have sex I feel like I’m just doing it to please him and I’m not really into it. Part of it could be that I’ve been so irritated it’s almost turning into resentment. Ive brought my issues up to him before and he acts like I’m either being a brat or tries to let the day go by and hope I forget. Very anti confrontational. Our LO is 6months now and I have PPD that comes and goes in waves. The only thing that keeps it at bay is staying busy and getting out of the house every other day. The few times I’ve wanted to go out with my friends he’s guilted me into being home by a certain time and acting like I’m immature for wanting to be out all night when I’m the one whose here with her the most and sometimes need a break. Meanwhile he has gone on multiple trips for fun or out with his friends. The only time I ever asked him to come home I couldn’t stop crying for no reason and wanted to see him and he said he’s almost done golfing which then lasted 3 hours. He travels for work a lot and his schedules unpredictable which makes me feel like a single parent at times. I started therapy and she suggested having him come and it’s been 6 weeks because of his work schedule. It makes me mad bc I feel that he puts work ahead of everything and when I bring it up he tells me that we wouldn’t have what we do without it. I understand sometimes work has to come first but staying out at a bar because other people want to entertain you is not important imo. He doesn’t FaceTime every night he’s gone which is fine but when I go out he makes comments ab me not wanting to be with her. He made me feel horrible through my nursing experience bc I wasn’t making a lot and I was so exhausted and stressed he read articles ab how to increase supply which was thoughtful but pressured me so much. When I said I don’t want to do it anymore he said he had a say and I told him they are my boobs and my decision. I just feel like we are on 2 separate trains trying to get to the same goal. I don’t want to hurt his feelings but he isn’t listening to how I feel and pushing it off like everything is fine and for me it isn’t. I just feel so out of love now and idk how to get that feeling back ,,hard time connect husband daughter count many time sex year constantly remind bc not lot not really sex drive sex feel like please really part could irritated almost turn resentment bring issue act like either brat try let day go hope forget anti confrontational lo month ppd come go wave thing keep bay stay busy get house every day time want go friend guilte home certain time act like immature want night one whose sometimes need break meanwhile go multiple trip fun friend time ever ask come home could not stop cry reason want see say almost do golfing last   hour travel work lot schedule unpredictable make feel like single parent time start therapy suggest come   week work schedule make mad bc feel put work ahead everything bring tell would not without understand sometimes work come first stay bar people want entertain important imo not facetime every night go fine go make comment ab want make feel horrible nursing experience bc not make lot exhausted stress read article ab increase supply thoughtful pressure much say not want anymore say say tell boob decision feel like   separate train try get goal not want hurt feeling not listen feel push like everything fine not feel love idk get feeling back,1.0,0.505446386753182

I haven’t had sex for 3weeks with my partner. I can tell he is frustrated about it but somehow he manages his sex needs( libido).

He thinks I can have sex 6weeks after birth. But I found articles about postpartum-depression. Even if I don’t get this symptom, it might take a long time to get my libido level back to normal.

461,"Hi all, this will be long so I really appreciate anyone reading long! I had my first baby in April 2020 and had terrible PPD and OCD for 18 months. It took that long to start to feel better and the road to there was horrendous. I felt like I was locked out of my life, couldn’t feel any positive emotions etc. But when my daughter turned 18 months or so, I felt myself coming out of it. Since then I’ve been pretty much recovered, except for some anxiety and lingering OCD. It took me a long time to even consider having a 2nd baby because I was terrified of it happening again. 

Fast forward to last December 2023, I had my 2nd baby, who arrived 5 weeks early. He spent 8 days in the NICU but came home very healthy & happy. Despite some initial anxiety, I had the most wonderful first year with him. So much so that I was considering a 3rd baby! I felt like I had totally healed the broken part of me that was robbed of that experience the first time around, we had an amazing bond and I felt so much joy. I had huge issues with guilt for *not* having that experience with my 1st but overall, it was a great year. 

Cut to 2 weeks ago and I was due back to work from maternity leave. I’m in Ireland so was off for nearly a year. I had anxiety about going back to work as my son is EBF and I’ve only spent a few hours away from him. My mom looks after my daughter who attends school now and was also taking my son. I work remotely so they were downstairs, not even far away. That first day I had what can only be described as a total mental health crash. I was extremely anxious and started experiencing derealisation. Everything felt weird & foggy. I pushed through till day 2 but it got worse. I could feel myself declining rapidly so I went to my doctor who agreed I was medically unfit for work and signed me off. I don’t know what’s happened but now I have this horrendous depression. I can’t feel my connection to my son or ANY positive emotions at all. I’m existing but the colour has gone out of life, I’m not enjoying anything. I’m absolutely devastated as I’ve gone through this during my son’s first Christmas, like I did with my daughter. I’m on meds as I never came off them during my 2nd pregnancy. I do think I’m burned out from the last year where I took zero time for myself, despite having a supportive husband. I’m back in therapy in January but I just feel so scared, alone and distraught. Could PPD happen nearly 1 year postpartum? Please share your experiences & stories, I feel so heartbroken.

463,"Context: My husband has always been so obsessed with me. Always very patient, kind, soft, loving, and such a good provider. 

After having my baby (8 months ago) I was going through a lot. Trying to balance a marriage while also trying to be a mother while also trying to take care of myself. I was also very particular about how things were done with my son and I probably didn’t come off very nice to my husband (who is a very hands on father btw) I wasn’t very nice to him, never name calling or yelling just talking down to him. I never realized how much I did it until I realized he was unhappy and told me how I made him feel. I have been making a conscious effort everyday to be better, but also really struggling with my own internal battles at the same time. 
He says everything I do just seems fake. He is so cold towards me and tells me he doesn’t know if he can look past the way I made him feel in those few months. I was battling so much and truly at my lowest. I completely lost myself in motherhood. I am not the wife I once was but I am really fighting to work through that. 
Our relationship/marriage has always been so easy.. we’ve never had to try or put in effort because it’s always been so natural to us but with a baby it’s a whole different story. He thinks it’s been long enough since we’ve had a baby and we should basically be getting back in our groove by now but I think otherwise. I think it takes more time than just 8 months to try and figure out how to manage a baby and a marriage at the same time. 
I feel really sad that he tells me he sees me differently after seeing me at my lowest postpartum but I know he is going through things too. He is actually debating on divorcing me over it. I guess I never realized how much I hurt him during those months but I wish he would be more understanding of what I was going through or of what I am still going through. I do all the night wakes because he works so I can stay home so I haven’t gotten solid sleep for 8 months.. I hold some resentment but I’m trying to let that go and work through it but he says all I do is make him feel guilty.

Im taking an AD (Vortioxetine) but it feels like it doesn't lower my anxiety level enough for me to sleep, I'm wondering if a change in meds is needed (I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a few days so maybe I can bring that up then) or if there's some tricks I can try to be able to take care of her without being an anxiety mess

Thank you :)",,"hi everyone

I went to the ER immediately and my daughter is with trusted family. Id been taking Zoloft since August and I saw no improvement whatsoever. It actually made things so much worse. Today wasn’t any better and we’re getting ready to have dinner and celebrate Christmas Eve. I feel like I should be happy like everyone else but I just feel sick.

I’m a FTM to a 9mo and my best friend is also a FTM to a 7mo, but our PP journeys have been very different, her baby was a lot more demanding while I had it easier. 
Recently she has changed her behaviour a lot, not picking up the phone, not returning messages/ calls, avoiding meeting up, not even responding in group chats she was very active previously. I suspect that she might be avoiding me because I have a considerably easier time with baby, and there might be some subconscious resentment.
Obviously I understand life changes after having a baby, but I’m a bit worried about her and suspect that she may be experiencing PPD. She’s trying to make everyone believe her life is amazing and she loves life with her baby girl, so on the few occasions I’ve tried to ask if she’s okay she gives a vague answer and never really shares anything but I can see she’s not as happy as she presents.
Which comes to the point, what can I do to support her? I want her to know she is loved and supported whatever she’s going through but I don’t know how to “reach her” anymore.

Any suggestions and advice welcome!! Xxx ",,"hi guy first time post

I didn’t remember them doing it, and when they came in the room I was preparing myself to get the check. (I always had to prepare myself because the process was so uncomfortable because of my history with SA and rape.

I posted here about 2 months ago, I was not doing well at all and since then I've been trying to get better, got on meds, went to the hospital for a week, was put on sick leave (I'm still not back a 100%) and well it got a bit better until it didn't..

I was the sole provider of the household but my husband got a job offer a few days ago, the problem with it is that it's shift work.. meaning I will be by myself to take care of our daughter most of the time now. I cannot sleep when I'm taking care of her. Like right now she's asleep next to me but I didn't sleep a wink. I don't know how I'm supposed to be taking care of her by myself (and go to work myself)... The thing is my husband struggled really hard to find this job so it's not like I can tell him to refuse it because it's also very hard for me to be the sole provider so there's no good compromise.

So now, I just don't know how I'm supposed to survive, I feel like it doesn't get better and I have no choice but to put my feelings aside and take care of everything. And I can't. I'm so freaking tired of it all, I feel like I can't breathe.. I realise that I'm kinda preparing to die, like I'm soaking it in when I'm holding my daughter or when she wraps her little fingers around mine, I've been telling her I'm sorry, I've been researching how I could proceed etc. I talked about it with my husband, I told him that I wanted to die and I think he doesn't know what to do but I don't either.

Of course he has never said it but I can just tell he does by the way he looks at me. When I talk, he is uninterested. When I dress up and look hot, he is uninterested. He tells me he doesn’t know why he can’t be happy in the marriage anymore. I am trying everything I can while at the same time trying to find myself again after having a baby.

479,"Hi everyone! I’m a 25M husband to my beautiful 24F wife, started dating when we were 19 and got married 2 years ago. A little backstory before I get into it. About a year into our relationship we both started talking about kids in the future and she expressed she had a fear of going through postpartum mainly because Bipolar depression runs heavily in her family, she’s been in therapy since she was 14 for her anxiety and said her therapist told her she hasn’t shown any signs of BPD so when we found out she was pregnant both of us kind of went in with high hopes and positive thoughts, thinking everything would be fine. 

The pregnancy went smoothly, some mood swings here and there but nothing too rocky. And then 9 months later she’s just popped out our little girl and as soon as we got home from the hospital it was like an instant shift in her energy. She’s naturally a calm and laid back person, but this time I could just tell the difference between them. Our conversations were short, she responded with one worded answers or shook her head yes and no when I asked questions. She just went completely blank all around. It was like talking to a wall.

One night I sat her down and tried to talk to her and she just broke down, and sobbed, screaming crying for hours. It was so heartbreaking that I started to cry as well, she’s never cried in front of me like that before. She had cried herself to sleep and the next morning I didn’t want to rush her or make her uncomfortable by asking what happened last night so we never ended up talking about it

Fast forward to last week and she’s doing her usual one month check in “she’s had to switch from weekly to once a month since the baby”. The room she does her sessions in is right next to the laundry room and I was in there grabbing clothes and I overhear her crying. Obviously as a worried husband I stop to listen and I hear these words “I feel so guilty being here. I don’t know why god gave me a child, I feel like I’m not deserving of motherhood, I just can’t be here anymore. I’m so tired” and more suicidal thoughts that she’s had.

I need my wife, my daughter needs her. But god would I do anything to take away her pain and carry that suffering for her. I just want to see her smile and laugh again, I want her to feel beautiful, and loved because she deserves the world. My heart just breaks for her, and as a husband I feel like I should automatically know what to do. But I don’t. I’m so stuck.

So for any mothers out there that have dealt with something similar what can I do to support her?

It was a mixture of hormones, past trauma, my husband 34M checking out, and  job related PTSD (last responder care). I’m on Zoloft now and attending therapy (group and individual). Although my spirits are lifting and I’m receiving the much needed help things are still the same with my husband. We had a great relationship prior to our LO being born which is why I moved in with him, got married and had a baby with him! I was very adamant about not wanting any of that with previous partners until I met my husband. Yes, we had our moments but we overcame it all with ease and conversation. 

Now… I don’t even know. I’m the primary parent to our LO and homemaker. I endure the restless nights, feed, bathe/dress, attend all doctor appointments, and financially provide for our LO (we have separate accounts) including all the cooking and cleaning. Hell! The first two months I lived on the couch while he had a full 8-10 hours of uninterrupted sleep in our bed. Not even a diaper change! Like most of us… I went without food, sleep and showering. Going to the bathroom was a task in itself. 

But moving onto why I’m here in the first place… holidays. Thanksgiving was a doozy - he was sloshed by dinner time and LO started teething. So, I was really looking forward to Christmas. This will be LO’s first Christmas and I was really looking forward to spending the day with family. We typically have a nice brunch, play games, and lounge around while catching up since we all live apart. 

I told him literally for weeks in advance how excited I was and looking forward to LO’s first Christmas. What I was planning on making and asking him for suggestions. After all that… he booked tickets to watch a movie with a friend on Christmas day. If everyone lived closer and we didn’t have to travel that morning to meet with everyone, I would have been okay with him stepping away for a bit while we all lounged about. But we have to travel 2 1/2 hours the day of - no, Christmas Eve is not an option because of work schedules. He booked his movie tickets to a theater 30 minutes away from where we live, mid afternoon, and made plans to hang out prior to/after the movie like he usually does with this friend. 

I know LO will not remember their first Christmas but this year was rough… I was looking forward to seeing all the family and having my little family there, too.

My partner is so distant-moody-cold and obviously hating his life with us now. I have PPD and him being so unhappy with our family when things were wonderful before baby #3 is making my depression feel all consuming.

Our pregnancy was normal, with some hiccups, and I was very supportive and present the whole time. I don’t see this as a chore, I am excited for parenthood. Labor and delivery was very hard on my partner and I have been trying all I can to be at their service.

488,"Hello, I’m 2 months and half postpartum. And I’m thinking of getting divorced after being married for a year and half. Reason being I don’t feel loved. When I was pregnant my husband would tell me I was beautiful when I complained about my weight gain and we were doing the deed until I was like 4-5 months pregnant. But since I gave birth he hasn’t called me beautiful once. The ‘i love you’ has become ‘love you’. The hug he gave me before he left for work or somewhere else seemed awkward, the ‘should I go in for a hug’ type of hug. He doesn’t seem interested in me unless I talk about our baby. He would rather masturbate then do it with me, and I addressed that to him and that I’ve been sexually frustrated too, he said he just needed to clear his mind for work, that was 6 weeks postpartum. Then we got intimate again for like a few days, when my mum was in town helping with our baby. Then it stopped again and I thought it was because my mum wasn’t here to help, but now that she’s here again, and been here for a week already, and our baby has been in her room, we still haven’t gotten intimate. I wore new nightgowns and stuff and it seemed like he didn’t at all. We have been arguing a lot after I gave birth, and he keeps saying we have to stay together for our baby. Since we got married we only went on a holiday just the two of us once. We spent our engagement celebration with his mum, my wedding wasn’t even about me but his friends, the whole time I was getting my makeup done I had to keep looking at my phone sorting transportation for his friends, then we spent our honeymoon with his friends and family, and again our wedding anniversary with his family. We were supposed to go on holiday together just the two of us today for two days, and let my mum stay at our house and mind our baby. But then I found out a few days ago that the schedule of our holiday consist of him going to the gym with his friend, and us having dinner with his friends. So I got upset and told him he could just go by himself then if that was the goal, so we argued, and he called me selfish. Also he had a pre Christmas party organized by his workplace which he didn’t bother asking me if I wanted to go with him, though he knew my mum would be here that day so I could go but instead he said he assumed I didn’t want to go. I asked him if he still loves me and why. He said yes and because I take care of our baby well, just that… no other reason. I don’t think it’s enough, at least not for me. Would it be selfish i decide to get divorced because I don’t feel loved? I don’t want my baby to keep seeing the unhappy me, I want him to see the happy me but I need to feel loved by my husband which at the moment it seems impossible. I’m lost, I feel like my life is over. I quit my job to be a stay at home wife, and lost my identity along the way. I love my baby so much, he’s so young, like he wouldn’t remember those time I took care of him… but I’m finding it hard to stay alive.

as the title says, i’ve been institutionalized. i’m currently waiting to be taken to my room as a write this. 

my partner has been manic for a month and completely detached from reality. now he’s in another hospital. i’ve helped him in the past but my ppd/ppa made it so i can not be there in ways that i once was. especially now that i have to take care of our daughter. it is difficult as a lot of his delusions right now involve me being against him. regardless of what i say or do, it is taken negatively. 

this stress of his delusions and hospitalization combined with financial struggles, relationship issues, and family illnesses/deaths in the past few months have become too much. i realized i cannot be there for my daughter. i thought i could be strong for my child and my relationship but i can’t.

now my daughter is with my mom (which i am so so so grateful for) but both of her parents are in different psych wards. i feel absolutely terrible for putting her into this situation. i knew i was at high risk for ppd and went to therapy and took medication but it was too little too late. i truly believe, even now, that i need to die because it’s my fault her life is so chaotic. i feel terrible that i barely mentioned her in this post because i am so focused on my own issues. but i’ve learned that ignoring them doesn’t help either (as now i’m here). 

idk what to do or why i’m writing this. i have a small circle and needed to confide. somehow. i have no idea what my daughter’s future looks like. i just want to get better for her. i’m scared and worried for her dad/my partner. but focusing on him is not going to help me get better now. thanks for reading this if you did. i appreciate it.",,"hi not usually make reddit post need get chest hope ok post

I was diagnosed with moderate/severe PPD at 2 weeks post partum, I experienced some horrific thoughts and feelings as well as quite substantial difficulties bonding with my baby. 
Fast forward to today, I’m now medicated and under the care of the perinatal mental health team. 
My depression is slightly better, I am mostly stable, albeit with the occasional drop in mood and tearful day I can get on with my day to day life fairly well. I have a fabulous bond with my daughter now; and I do believe I am her favourite person as she can spot me a mile off and greets me with the biggest of smiles. 

Recently, myself and my husband have been bickering. He works full time and also works extra shifts to earn us more money while I care for our daughter 24/7 (including all of the night wakings). My husband’s states that he is stressed, and thought that things would be different by now and that I would have recovered. 
I know full well that the journey to recovery is a long and rocky road, filled with a lot of setbacks and potentially relapse. 

I don’t know how to make him understand how I’m feeling, I often hide my bad days and don’t really discuss my thoughts and feelings with him through fear of adding additional stress. He also states that he is really tired, and although I do appreciate the amount that he works, he appears to disregard that raising a child is also a full time job, and I’m waking up through the night with our daughter while he gets a full nights rest. 

We both love each other and by no means am I suggesting that our relationship is at stake, I just wondered if anyone else has been in my shoes and maybe had any ideas on how to make him understand that this isn’t a choice, I am unwell, depression is an illness and that maybe, someday, things will be as they once were.

I'm a first time mama and by the title you should know that I have no one to talk which is why I've resorted to reddit. I'm 10 months postpartum with my beautiful baby boy and I couldn't be happier to have him choose me as his mama. The way he smiles at me just instantly clears my head of any of the thoughts I'm having. He's a cute little velcro baby who literally can't stand to be held by anyone but me and his dad on occasions. That being said, I'm burnt tf out and extremely lonely. I moved from NYC to a whole other country across the world to be with my family to support me through this new stage in my life. The same way they supported my brother with his first born. That being said, things are not going as expected. The village I thought I had is pretty much non existent and it hurts. I witnessed my mother be a grandmother to her first grandkid and was so excited to bring my own life into this world to see how she would treat him, but he isn't getting half as much attention as my niece and my mom uses the excuse that he's a ""mammas boy"" and that she's getting ""too old"". I've also been seriously hurt by my sister in law who is a manipulative snake. She gave birth to her second baby around the same time as me giving birth to my first and completely ripped the moment away from me. Didn't let me have a welcome party for my son because she wanted to have a welcome party for her son around the same time. She also complained to my brother that my mom wasn't helping her when my mom explicitly told her that she would help her once she made me food. My mom had offered to make me food because i was sleepless with a colic baby and also had stitches down there so could barely move which made it hard for me to get food for myself. My brother comes up to me after his wife complains to him and starts yelling at me asking me why I couldn't wait to eat because his wife needed help and no one was helping her. I immediately lashed out and started crying hysterically while I was breastfeeding my baby. At the time, we were all staying at my mothers but once that fight happened, I packed my bags and left. So ever since then I pretty much haven't been getting the support I needed from my family. My husband has been helping as much as he can but even he's burnt out. We haven't had sex in almost two years and I physically cannot have sex because the nurse at the time of my delivery over stitched me so I need to go back to the hospital and get a reconstructive surgery so till then we haven't been intimate with each other and that's also causing some trouble between us. We've tried to go on dates before and left the baby with my mom but she called us and told us that she couldn't do it and that he was crying hysterically because he only wants to be with me so since then we haven't had time alone.

Hi so quick question and long post. 

I had a baby in August and since then my body is not the same. I need to know if anyone has experienced something similar? 

A backstory: 
About 7 weeks postpartum I was experiencing a light green discharge. Went to the dr. And was told I was fine. Did a bacterial panel, STD panel and all was clear. I went back a month later with persistent green discharge and now pelvic/uterine pain and cramping. Was told I’m fine and it’s a physiological change to pregnancy after further bacterial testing came back negative. 
I felt like something was wrong and got a second opinion. I was placed on prophylactic antibiotics for the green discharge and an US was ordered. Finally, this month (4 months later) I was told again I’m fine. I did a transvaginal US along with another bacteria/STD panel and everything looks clear with the exception of some trace free fluid in my uterine cavity. Which my doctor told me could pose no issue since my US was clear otherwise. 
The only issue is I still have the discharge and pain. The discharge happens at least once every three days. And pain is daily. I would describe it as varying from sharp to dull to cramping to achey. Nothing triggers it and it’s affecting me working out, having sex etc. 

I should add I had ICP and discovered to have preeclampsia at my birth that went undiagnosed due to hidden symptoms. Otherwise healthy pregnancy and baby. 

I just feel sort of hopeless since I’ve been cleared from a gynecological standpoint and was wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar after having their own baby. 
This is my first baby. I was completely healthy otherwise. So to be struggling with this postpartum is really bothering me. I would also be lying if I said I wasn’t experiencing any anxiety about these persistent symptoms when it came to the discharge and pain. I just want to know if anyone has experienced the same thing and got better over time?

504,"Hi all, new to this sub and new to parenting. FTM 28. 

I dont know if I have pp rage, depression, or anxiety or a fun combo of all three but I feel like I’m drowning. I do have a history of mental illness, mainly depression and anxiety led by my bipolar disorder but I haven’t felt like this in years. I would also like to preface, I love my husband he is a good man. So if you feel the need just keep it to constructive criticism. 

I’m struggling really hard with being a mom, I love my daughter ( a month today!) I never even thought I could get pregnant, but I am exhausted, touched out and at my wits end. When she’s not using me for a pacifier, she’s eating, then sleeps for a short period before waking up absolutely pissed about any number of things. Hungry, gassy, just wants to be held, a dirty diaper (which she’s even more pissed to be changed, don’t really get that but okay). she is a fairly good baby, I definitely wouldn’t classify her as colicky, she just is a well a newborn baby. But I also can’t get anything done, right now in the main caregiver as I’m EBF and my husband works full time as we discussed me taking a full 3 month maternity leave. It’s also RSV season so I’m isolated at home, I’m sick of looking at the same 8 walls (bedroom and living room) everyday. My poor animals are getting neglected as by the time that they actually want attention I’m so sleep deprived or touched out that I just want them away from me. I feel horrible because they just look at me like I broke their hearts. I’ve been having issues with my supply, it was my fault I wasn’t being consistent because I was desperately sleep deprived and my bipolar is really bad idk I don’t get sleep, so I’ve become angry and defensive over that. I literally cried over spilled breast milk last night because it was the last 3 oz in the fridge and I was just done being touched for a little bit but then had to feed her anyways because I spilled it. I’ve been having severe upper back pain that’s ruining this stage for me. I don’t wanna hold my daughter because it makes the pain 10x worse. So instead of enjoying my newborn snuggles I can’t wait to get her off me. Which in turn makes me feel so guilty, because I haven’t enjoyed any of it. I didn’t enjoy pregnancy because I was sick or in miserable pain the entire time and now I’m not able to find the joy in being a mom. Don’t get me wrong I have my moments where she’s off me and calm and I’m so overloaded with joy I just cry because I love her so much and I’m so happy, but the times I’m not make me feel so bad. 

My husband helps when he can, he’s totally down to go to work sleep deprived so he can stay up and settle the baby, or feed her if I have milk pumped. Anything with the baby he’s all in for, but he’s stopped caring to take care of me. I know I’m a big girl and I can care for myself, but I’m so busy caring for another human I don’t think about me other than survival. Eat, drink water, pp care, sleep. Sometimes I’m not even eating because I can’t get to the kitchen to make myself something because I have a baby attached to my chest or who refuses to be put down and all the food we have has to be cooked in some form. If I want something from him I have to ask. Which I guess is fine? He will do anything I ask with out hesitation, but sometimes I just don’t want to expend the mental effort to ask him to do things. I just want him to see the need and fulfill it. We’ve got boxes and trash piled by our front door because he won’t walk it to the dumpster, dishes that need to be done, a dishwasher that desperately needs a clean because it smells like death??? I’d like him to get up and want to make me breakfast because I’ve explained 65 times that I need it (this was an issue over pregnancy as well and he wouldn’t make me something till I was physically ill every morning). I want him to want to sweep, mop, and vacuum the floors, pick up after himself to not add to the mess, ask about me and how I’m feeling, offer to rub my back before I complain or am in tears, just simple things. I don’t want to have to ask for every little thing. He knows this as we’ve discussed it, and I feel bad for putting so much on him, but I just need him to take care of things so I can focus on the baby and myself. It’s just me and him. My mother lives 2-3 hours away and we are for the most part estranged, and my mil while only 40 minutes away is sometimes overbearing, sweet as can be and her and my FIL  have done so much to help, I just don’t want to sit with them while they coo over the baby. I feel so horrible that I’ve become this mean rage filled person in my relationship, but I don’t feel good. I’m tired of being asked stupid obvious questions by my husband who’s just unobservant, I’m tired of asking for every little thing, I’m tired of being tired, I’m tired of being home 24/7, I’m tired of the acne, feeling ugly and being frustrated by my husband loving on me and trying to make me feel attractive by making out with me, because it just reminds me that I have maybe another month of recovery before I can do anything sexual with him. I don’t want to tell him he can’t do things he enjoys to unwind from work or be his own person, but I feel totally alone and I want him to want to not do anything else. He’s a gaming YouTuber so he often plays games or is recording or editing a video if he has any true free time. 

I feel guilty that I have a mental health disorder that requires sleep for me to be able to manage it well and I can’t sleep because I have to take care of her. I feel guilty that I’m not enjoying this as much as I should, that I haven’t enjoyed ANY part of my pregnancy or postpartum at all. I feel guilty that I don’t enjoy breastfeeding. I feel guilty and like a failure I tapped out during labor. I feel like a failure and guilty because her rooms not even done. I cry at some point in the night every night and sob because I feel so bad about so many things. I just feel horrible and now I’m pissed off all the time too. 

Sorry this was so long I just needed to rant maybe to people who would understand. Because no one in my life I can talk to would get this. Any advice? Anyone in solidarity? Or have i completely gone insane and I’m just a bad mom and wife? Help. ",,"hi new sub new parenting ftm

505,"I found out I was pregnant, and had a miscarriage that week. I was going to get an abortion, but it was still very traumatic to suddenly have the choice taken from me. 
This was about 5 weeks ago. I knew I was miscarrying because while passing some blood and tissue on the toilet, I started cramping horribly. I called for my bf and fainted in his arms shortly after. I was out for about 10 secs. I went to the hospital, where they confirmed I was miscarrying, gave me fluids, told me to take Advil and reach out to my obgyn.
My obgyn told me to take ibeprofen for pain while I passed all the tissue/miscarried at home. 2 weeks go by and I now have a follow up. my doctor saw me for an ultrasound to check everything had passed, and it hadn’t. I was scheduled for a D&C but had to wait a week to get an appointment due to the holidays. I finally have a D&C. 
It was really scary and anxiety inducing for me, because I don’t like needles and doctors already. Now it’s been a week, and I’m feeling less (but still quite a few random harsh) cramps, not bleeding too much at all, but still so tired/fatigued and achey. 

The worst thing though right now is my emotions. I feel so spun out of control. It’s like my highs are so high and my lows are so low that there’s no time for anything in the middle. I know it’s hormonal. I’m usually pretty able to deal with my anxiety and emotions very well. Right now I feel constantly on edge. What do I do about this?

 I feel all sorts of stress from missing work and not being able to do barely anything for the past few weeks. I feel kinda weirdly sad but not sad in terms of grieving the baby I was probably gonna abort. I have had 2 abortions before… this just feels emotionally different, maybe a bit heavier. My partner has been more supportive and patient than I’ve ever experienced support in my life, and still I can’t help but be upset even at him sometimes and it sucks. I don’t even really wanna work, or see any friends, I just wanna stay in my room and order Uber eats until I’m back to normal me (obviously I won’t do that I’m just saying what it feels like). Help?

I have a really bad fear of being sick which is why I’m always so scared to start new medication.    I was prescribed this a few weeks ago and decided that I want to wait to start it after Christmas.    

If this medication caused you dizziness or caused you to pass out. Please DO NOT TELL ME!!!     It is my worst fear to be dizzy and pass out. 

How was your experience with this medication?   How long did it take until you started feeling happier ?   Did it help with anxiety as well as depression ?   Did it make you throw up?   What side effects did you have and how long did they last ?  Is there anything I can do to make it easier for my self ?   

My main question is will I ever feel normal again ?  My anxiety started when I was 14 years old.   It came on so suddenly out of no where.   It was Halloween night 2021 and my ex boyfriend got extremely paralytic drunk.  He was throwing up blood and I thought he was going to die. It traumatised me.   Since that night I started having panic attacks daily and stopped going to school. I developed severe emetophobia ( fear of being sick ).    Things have never been the same since.   It always gets better in the summer.  I am able to leave my house a little more often than in winter and feel less shitty generally.   I dropped out of school and never went back. So I missed the last two years of high school which is a real shame because I was so smart and had really good grades.  I’d always dreamt of being a neonatal nurse.     I could leave my house by my self without giving it a second thought.  I could go into town with my friends and do whatever I want with no worries at all.     I have tried counselling in the past and i hated it. It didn’t do anything for my anxiety or depression.   My mum also paid a lot of money for me to have private hypnotherapy. And again that was a big waste of money and didn’t help me at all.   Will I ever be able to do that again ? Or will there always be some of that anxiety in the back of my mind. ?

Due to the lack of mental health resources at the time, she was committed to an asylum and died several months later due to ""loss of flesh"" (starvation, as she had lost the desire to eat.)

I've never thought about the women who came before us, who laid the groundwork for the maternal mental healthcare we have today but in this moment I am eternally grateful that I can help manage my symptoms with modern medicine and therapy.

512,"So I'm trying to navigate being 4 months postpartum and having to go back to work a month early. My gynecologist has been dismissive of everything. 

Childbirth was hard on me. It's my first child and my gynecologist was dismissive of all my worries. High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes run in my family her response was I'm fine I don't have anything to worry about. I was extremely dehydrated no matter how much I drank so my primary ran test and said I was pre-diabetic and to monitor my glucose because it was high. Feet were swelling bad on top of it. But she still insisted I was fine. He wasn't a big baby 8 lbs 11 oz. I was worried because both my sisters had huge babies and had to have c-sections. Again all I got told was oh doesn't mean I will. 

I had a natural birth but suffered tearing. Not sure if it's normal but she didn't tell me I had second degree tearing and had stitches. I was also running a fever due to covid during my labor so I wasn't able to have my support system outside of my husband. Who while I love, kept off to the side worried about being in the way. All I got told for my after care was don't wipe or use soap. Had to Google for how long and tiktok was basically how I knew what to look out for and what to do to help ease the pain. 

I spent my first two weeks in tears because of the pain and being unable to get to the baby or hold him. I'm still having pain 4 months later. My lower abdomen and hips are still hurting. Mainly getting up from sitting or off the bed can be extremely hard on me and hurts. Sometimes I have to hold the table or the wall. And now I'm back to work it's increased and someone else has to move the baby around for me at the end of the day. At my 8 week follow up she said i was healing fine and had extra scarring (???). And claimed the lower abdomen pain was my period coming back. Mind you yes I've had my period last month but the cramps were different than the pain I was feeling. My anxiety was also high once again and she did prescribe me a low dosage of my former medication.

Once again it was my primary who ran test and referred me to a different gynecologist at this point. I still haven't been able to speak with a therapist and won't for another 2 weeks. I'm told this could be PCOS, which I had and had to get on metformin to get pregnant, and or endometriosis. I had to go back to work due to my paid family leave running out and it barely covered my bills as is and had been putting my health insurance on my credit card.

My anxiety has increased even more. I'm starting to feel stressed from everything due to the gynecologist. I'm depressed from feeling like I'm drowning. My husband tries his best and we have my parents but I'm overwhelmed. Sometimes the baby crying triggers me but I don't want him to be away from me. I can't even go back on disability because I can't afford to keep putting my insurance on the credit card ($550 a month, me & baby). I did get medi-cal but have had 0 luck getting ahold of those doctors. Call goes straight to voicemail that literally only has the generic voicemail and doesn't even say it's a doctors office. No call backs so I don't even feel like I have that for a fall back.

I do see the gynecologist my primary recommended this week but it's stressing me even more. I'm worried I'll be told I should go back on disability due to my pains. It's visible on my face and in the way I walk. I also got recommended to a endocrinologist but his office is busy and has yet to return any of my calls and that online booking also says unable to.

I just feel like I have no help. No time to breathe. Especially now back to work. And I feel like a failure because I can't always hold my baby or soothe him when he's crying. I worry I'm going to drop him due to the issues. I'm bottling everything in because I know my husband tries and does a lot. I don't want him to feel bad. But I don't know what to do. I have no idea how to navigate this and motherhood.

518,"Sorry for the long post in advanced. Never in a million years did I think I would be posting this about having PPD but here I am. I’ve stopped breastfeeding almost a month ago and over the past few weeks have been overcome with anxiety, depression and paranoia. The smallest things trigger me and make my spiral with no end. As soon as I start to have a good few hours and feel like myself, something negative happens that sends me through my next rollercoaster of emotions. I get  postpartum rage like no other and try to ground myself with EFT tapping but the way I get angry over the smallest things is terrifying me. Not only that but paranoia started to creep in and I get crazy thoughts that I have this negative being watching me when I’m alone and intrusive thoughts set in. 

I’ve told my boyfriend and I know he wants to help but has no idea how. Sometimes he will have an attitude with me and I’ll snap and lose myself emotionally. He’s getting to the point where when I tell him how I’m feeling he just sits silent and lets me cry. I know it’s not his fault but I’m sure he’s exhausted from seeing me miserable all the time. I know it’s hard for him but I wish he could understand that I don’t even want to be with myself. 

I’ve reached out to my primary to try and get some answers on what to do next. I’m just lost right now and don’t know who I am and I want to be able to enjoy my life and be present for my 4 month old.

519,"Can anyone please help me understand my wife? We just had a baby 2 weeks back. I’m noticing very apparent changes in her mood. She is usually a fun loving person but nowadays even though I’m still able to make her laugh, I feel there is a constant sadness deep within her. I know breastfeeding has been hard on her because that is something she said explicitly. Her mood is especially bad in the morning, at times she cries just after waking up. I’ve tried to open her up and tell me the issue but she does not say anything. I’m 100% sure that something is wrong but I don’t what it is exactly or how to help her. I can take her to the doctor but without her willing to go I don’t know how to do that. 

One more thing that I’ve noticed but I maybe wrong as this is my observation is I feel a lack of bond with the baby. She gets irritated that the baby has to feed this much. This is first baby for both of us so I can’t really tell as an observer what is normal. But I definitely don’t see any joy in her while she is breastfeeding.

Another thing that she has mentioned is that I leave her alone. We have a lot of help at home so the workload is definitely not something that would bother her but me going to office or golf, could it be something that might bother her emotionally?

I know I’ve not given enough information but this is all I’ve. What should I do?

Edit: thanks for all your recommendations and support. I’ve tried to get actively get more involved and just be there for her and things are significantly getting better. You all gave me some perspective which I didn’t have earlier.

523,"My 12.5 year old Pomeranian  Eevee was diagnosed with late stage heart failure in May and was given 3-6 months maybe a year to live.  We were given meds to keep her comfortable and to maintain her daily life. I was suppose to be due in September and had major anxiety she wouldn’t make it to the birth. She was my light and comfort during my pregnancy journey. I know I was suppose to mentally prepare for the worst but every day she looked and acted like the happy little pup except for the terrible coughing fits she had all day and night. I prayed that she at least make it to the birth to meet her human brother and she did since he came a month early in August and she lived up until he was three months. I’m starting to have a lot of guilt, that maybe I didn’t give her enough care or attention during my pregnancy and afterwards cause I was tending to my son and that she felt neglected when I had to close the door on her at night cause her coughing would wake the baby up. Then I felt bad that maybe I should’ve waited to have a baby so that her last years would be full of my attention.  I start to think that maybe I could’ve taken better care of her health, done more for her quality of life. Then I also feel bad that I didn’t take enough photos of her and my son or even me and her. The day before she died she collapsed and I could tell she wasn’t right even when she got back up and was semi normal. I wanted to take her to vet but my son needed to feed and nap and by the time i finished the vet was closing and she didn’t seem bothered. I was gonna take her in the morning if she didn’t seem like herself again. I spent a little extra cuddle time with her before I had to put my son to bed and I don’t know why I said it but I told her if she was in pain and needed to go it would be okay and that I loved her.  ( I feel selfish for thinking maybe if I hadn’t said that she would be here still and maybe she took it as I didn’t want her to stay anymore.) I woke up at 5am dec 10th to change my sons diaper and she raised her head to look at us but didn’t follow like usual so when I was done I came back and noticed she was laying too still. All i remember was a blur and she died in my arms. I feel guilty that she waited for me to wake up and she wasn’t the first thing I held or that I left her in the room for a bit before holding her.  And now I can’t stop crying and feeling sad and I don’t want my son to feed of that I feel like a bad fur mom and a bad mom cause I just feel like I haven’t handled anything right and I can’t give my son my full attention without getting sad and seeing her during our normal day routine with him.  Like I didn’t have enough time to grieve her before I dropped her at the vet cause my son needed me. Everything felt rushed and like a dream. I’m just overwhelmed with emotions.  I just don’t know what to do anymore. My parents who originally didn’t want her but then feel in love are also sad but they keep telling me I have a son now and I need to put my grief aside for him. I know they mean well and they are very old school when it comes to emotion (Asian parents with very little emotions) but I just can’t seem to stop crying.  When does this get better.

529,"Hi everyone, I’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling a lot lately and wondering if what I’m experiencing might be postpartum depression.  

I have two young children—a 6-week-old newborn and a 1-year-old. Most days, I feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and filled with moments of uncontrollable anger, often directed at my husband.  

My relationship with my husband has been strained since my pregnancies and during this postpartum period. He does help, but his efforts often create more work for me. For example, if he feeds the baby, he might lose the bottle lid, leaving me to search for it later when washing bottles. He doesn’t take initiative and rarely does things without me asking, which really irritates me.  

Stressful moments are the worst. If the baby has a blowout, I’m left frantically cleaning her up and looking for clothes while she’s crying, and he just sits there—either ignoring me or watching. The crying overwhelms me to the point where I start shouting, and his response is to go silent, which triggers me even more. We’ve talked about his inaction in these situations, but it feels like we’re going in circles.  

He recently told me he tries to leave the room or spend time alone because my shouting makes him feel triggered. This, however, only makes me feel more abandoned. I desperately want us to spend time together—not just for me, but for our kids.  

Arguments follow a predictable cycle. I say horrible things out of frustration, and he goes quiet. After a few hours or the next day, he starts acting like nothing happened, which makes me feel dismissed. It’s as though my feelings don’t matter. I feel invisible, as though my emotions and efforts don’t matter, and I’m constantly battling loneliness and frustration

I love my kids deeply, but I feel so disconnected from myself. All I seem to do every day is shout at my husband, say hurtful things, and cry afterward out of guilt and loneliness. 

Another thing I've noticed is that sometimes when my toddler won't stop crying I get sudden burst of anger and I shout 'stop crying' and I feel insanely overwhelmed.
Then I feel guilty and sad for shouting because he's just a baby, I feel like a terrible mother.

I’ve thought about reaching out to a GP or health visitor, but I’m terrified they’ll judge me as a mother or, worse, think I’m unfit and take my children away. As I'm writing this right now I'm sitting here crying because I feel like I'm failing as a mother and my children deserve better.

Could this be postpartum depression? Is postpartum rage part of it? If anyone has experienced this, I’d be so grateful for your insights or advice.
 
I have a health visitor visiting today so I'm wondering should I say anything? If so, what? I don't want her to think I'm an unfit mother and take my children away (that's my biggest fear) but I also want to know if this is normal and if there's help I can get. Btw I'm from the UK.

533,"Hey, my wife and I just had our second baby. We have three kids (I have one from a previous marriage.) One moment we’re happy and she’s fine and the next moment she’s pissed at me. She tells me I’m a good dad and I help with the kids, then the next moment she says I’m a child and I’m selfish and hard to deal with. We have ZERO romantic relationship. I try to make an effort but she doesn’t care at all. Today I was late picking up one of the kids from my parents, I was gone 1 hour. It takes 20 minutes to get there and back. I talked to my mom for 20 minutes. She freaks out, turns it into a huge argument. I mainly watch the older two while she watches the baby. I feed and change the baby, but it’s hard for me to help at night cause she’s breastfeeding. I feel super under appreciated, I cook almost every meal, I clean, I watch the kids, I take the oldest to school, I work nightshift. I make an active effort to consider her and get her things. One minute she loves me and the next moment she hates me. Tonight she said she wants to “give up.” I told her she needs to go to the doctor and get put on medication/therapy. It’s ruining our marriage. It’s like if one thing doesn’t go as planned in her head she goes off. I do have my faults, I can’t be 100% all of the time, there are times where I’m exhausted too. I make crude jokes but I always have since we were together it’s just how I am and I don’t really mean anything by it.  Our second child is a hard child, he’s into everything, constantly throwing tantrums ( 1.5 yo M). It’s almost impossible to be around her, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, I just wait for her to explode. She blames me for everything. I don’t feel like she loves me at all, she says we don’t have a relationship. I can tell she is disgusted by me, she hardly ever touches me. I do whatever she wants, scratch her head or back, get her whatever she ask. I feel like I just serve her and the kids. I don’t feel loved at all by her. My life revolves around how she feels, and if she feels bad she takes it out on everyone around her. Her family has told me that she’s been that way since she was a kid. I can’t tell if I’m the asshole or if she’s gaslighting me any time we argue. Help please our marriage is falling apart.

But as I said, the friend has distanced herself from us and will post cries for help on social media. They have just hit a point where they want to protect their own peace and not reach out to our friend dealing with PPD currently.

541,"I’m 5 weeks pp today and I had my baby at 33 weeks and 3 days due to sudden severe preeclampsia and preterm labor. I ended up having a C-section. My boyfriend of 2 years has suddenly decided he is not sure if he wants to be with me anymore now. His reason is because I haven’t been cleaning and apparently I have never cleaned enough. Back story is, he moved in in April when I found out I was pregnant because he was going to be on house arrest due to a DUI and I became a SAHM in August when I quit my job to help take care of him after a motorcycle accident ( he is all healed now). I feel very blindsided by this but the PPD is kinda helping with the numbness I guess so I’m just like slowly processing it and I’m not overly upset. He has an alcohol problem that is suddenly becoming a problem again and I made him aware of the a couple days ago which obviously upset him and he denied it being an issue. He never offered to help me clean the house and I ended up asking my mother to come help me by sitting with my other kids and the baby so that I could clean because he left to go stay with his dad tonight and tomorrow I guess. 

I spent almost 3 weeks everyday at the NICU breastfeeding my son I was there from 7am-7pm every day. Ultimately the only reason he got to come home was because I stayed at the NICU for 48 hours straight breastfeeding because he didn’t do well with a bottle at all and the feeding was the only thing that determined how long he stayed. He’s only been home for 2 weeks now and I haven’t slept much so I sleep in fairly late after I take my other kids to school and try to make it a point to get up and clean something every day when I do get up. He’s had multiple days off work due to cold weather and spends his time drinking in the garage. Never offers to help and frankly I don’t want him to hold my newborn while he’s drunk anyways. He held him the other day for an hour (when he was sober) while I did some dishes and stuff and then mentioned his arm hurting and he can’t just sit in one position for that long. So I didn’t get much done. I’m just like confused how suddenly he doesn’t want to be with me because of a mess, but doesn’t want to help and was just saying how lucky he was to have me just a couple weeks ago. When I mentioned him helping he said “I didn’t make the mess and I pay the bills you don’t”. I didn’t realize I guess when I took on the roll of a SAHM I was going to be doing it completely by myself with no help at all. I also didn’t realize that months later he would decide to leave me where I have no job and 2 kids and a baby to be responsible for. I just don’t even know what to say or how to even feel.

548,"My daughter is 4 months old, and I feel like an absolute disaster. Before she was born, I was fiercely independent and a workaholic. My husband and I have been working together for the past seven years.

My pregnancy was unintentional, but it went smoothly. We live with my widowed MIL, who has always been difficult. She says the most hurtful and insensitive things, but I used to manage by retreating to my room for personal space. Even after all these years, I’ve never felt like this house is mine. I tiptoe around her—not because I fear her, but because I dread her comments that hurt me deeply.

She doesn’t let me cook and babies my husband like he’s a child. She constantly tries to prove she’s closer to him than I am, saying things like, “He held my hand when we went to [so-and-so place].” My husband never sees a problem with her behavior and always asks me to tolerate her because she’s a widow.

Everything changed after I became a mother.

When my daughter was born, my MIL became possessive to an extreme. At the hospital, she didn’t let my mother hold the baby. She took over feeding her formula and cleaning her, even though I was breastfeeding. Later, she told my SIL in front of everyone, “She already had the best time with her daughter while feeding her for two days.” It broke me—why does she feel the need to take over and act like she’s the mother?

At home, her constant advice and interference completely drain me. She calls my daughter her child and keeps emphasizing that the baby looks like my husband or my SIL. It’s like she’s trying to erase me.

She even told me, “Your daughter loves you now because you’re feeding her. Later, you won’t need to worry because I’ll cook for her, and she’ll forget you.” I want to cook for my daughter—I need to. But she controls the kitchen and creates a scene whenever I cook. Still, I’ve started asserting myself and cooking anyway.

I took a therapy session where the therapist suggested I should appreciate the help. But why can’t I have the freedom to raise my daughter the way I want? Why can’t I decide what’s best for her? I’m constantly anxious about the future—what if my MIL starts dominating me even more when it comes to feeding or other decisions?

I hate conflict, but I have to face her every day. She’s intruding on my life, and I feel like I’m suffocating. Every day feels heavier than the last. I wake up gripped by dread and anxiety.

I’ve also become very possessive of my daughter. I hate it when others, especially my MIL, spend time with her. I fear that my daughter won’t recognise me as her mother or won’t care about me. I know some of these thoughts are irrational, but I can’t help it.

I come from a small family and am extremely close to my parents. I don’t have many friends, so this situation feels even more isolating.

549,"Need to vent but also need advice. 

I’m sorry but life was so great before getting unexpectedly pregnant. I thought it was what I wanted, but the poor decisions I made while being pregnant and post partum have ruined everything. 

I got pregnant, then spontaneously bought a house 9 months pregnant. I then had the baby. I then worked through my maternity leave from home because I was too concerned about losing money, it’s just not fair to have to go without pay for three months after suffering through the trauma of having a child. 

Then, my husband and I freaked out about the mortgage payment, so we stupidly listened to our shitty realtor and moved out of our BRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION BEAUTIFUL HOME to move back in (in a way shittier climate mind you- I used to live in Vegas) back to my mothers hoarder house in NY because we also missed family and I can’t handle the baby. 

NOW, my house isn’t selling, I am wasting $3k a month on a mortgage. I left the best and easiest six figure position I had back in Vegas which I now can’t get back. The closest offer I can get is a massive paycut to where I’ll be eating into my savings each month to get by. 

I’m now stuck and probably going to have to take a loss just to get out from under the house. I’m now stuck on the east coast in this miserable shit hole in miserable weather. I could go back to Vegas but for a fucking price as I’m going to be working harder than ever for less money, lonely (I do love my family and the company) and on my own taking care of this baby while my husband will probably go work another shit job on an opposite schedule because it’s that or spend a fucking fortune on child care. 

I’m miserable in NY, I was miserable in Vegas but realized the west coast and weather there was so much nicer- but also can’t stand the loneliness. And now the fact that I will be busting ass to barely make it by. Or, stay in NY like a fucking loser living with my mother with the three of us cramped in a tiny bedroom. I can either quit my job once the house sells and rot away doing nothing because there is nothing to do in NY in this shit weather/nothing to do period honestly, I’m a nature lover and there’s none of that living right outside NYC. Or, I can stay at my job that I took coming here where I make money but deal with a dangerous and lengthy commute every fucking day (I’m talking 3-4 hours of travel every day) and the best part? When I get there there is nowhere to park. 

I have the option to either take the low offer, get my house and the beautiful west coast, but be miserable in the low offer job and struggling financially, struggling with loneliness and raising a kid by myself, or, sell the house likely at a loss (not willing to rent as that is also going to be a loss that I’m perpetually stuck with), and live in my moms shitty house in shitty weather in the shitty state of NY, but at least there’s some family around to keep company. 

What do I do now? I ruined my life. I feel like I am never going to be happy again. I enjoy nothing. My life is such a mess now (I can’t even unpack my things because of how cluttered the house is) we don’t even do milestone pictures (I can’t find anything), I don’t even remember to take them. He doesn’t have the space to play like he did at our other house but has family in his life now. But he screams because all he wants to do is explore and I have t gotten the chance to clean the mess and child proof the house. 

I am MISERABLE.

550,"Hi, 

I’m 11 weeks post partum and while I absolutely love my son I still feel like someone just died.
More specifically me, or a part of me. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Every waking minute I spend worrying and thinking about my son. But all I really want most of the time is to run away and be free of all the responsibility. I keep feeling like he’d be better off without a mom who feels this way. I keep wanting to just go through the day without planning his bottles, his diaper changes, his tummy time, hearing him scream, sleep training. I just want to be me again. 
The only thing I do lately that remotely feels like me is go for a run 2-3 times a week. I put my headphones in and blast really loud techno and just run anywhere. It makes me feel for a moment I could actually leave. I never do. But it’s become such an obsession that I overdo it. I almost go every day. I’m scared because last time I obsessed about something like this I got an eating disorder. 
I also can’t sleep at all, the only thought that puts me to sleep is ending it all. Like literally thinking about it until I fall asleep. The weird thing is I don’t even have any plan to do it at all or even want to. It just feels like I am getting through the days and they all feel the same. I can’t even see a future further than a week from now. How am I supposed to do this parent thing for the next years????",,"hi

Postpartum is hard and mothers are not fully prepared for the immense changes that occur. If you’re a new or seasoned mom navigating postpartum, I wanted to share a space I’ve created. It’s a Discord community focused on support, connection, and self-care for moms who may be feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, or simply looking for a place to connect with others who get it.

Motherhood can be isolating at times, especially in the postpartum phase. Whether you’re struggling with your mental health, juggling the demands of parenting, or just needing a safe space to vent and share, our group is here for you. We also host weekly events designed to encourage mindfulness, wellness, and self-care, including:

\-Mindfulness Mondays: A space to reset and set intentions for the week.  
\-Wellness Wednesdays: Tips and discussions on how to prioritize your health, both physically and mentally.   
\-Future Q&As with specialists.

A bit of background, I was constantly stressed during my postpartum on whether I was being a good mother and wanted to follow wake windows. This caused me super depressed and stressed all the time. Now I am better. 

Well now, My friend, FTM, she is expecting and is currently at around 8 months. So I told my friend that it is not all fun and exciting because I always had the feeling that I would have prepared myself if someone has said this to me. But her response hurt me a lot. 

She said her close friend did not have the depression and managed it well and depends on people. She says it really is how well you could have managed it. She also said to stop bringing negativity to her and she will ask if she needs counselling. I was hurt when I tried to make her ready for what’s coming and all I got in return is that I did not manage it well. 

Now, I feel I am overreacting and constantly asking myself whether I was showing my weak self towards my baby. I am questioning myself “Did I not manage it well? Am I doing something wrong in telling people the actual reality?” I think this lingering feeling will never go away now. 

Edit: Reading all your comments has been incredibly reassuring. It reminds me that I’m not alone in this postpartum journey, and it’s comforting to know that the challenges I’m facing are shared by others. It makes me happy to realize that I’ve been doing my best, and there’s nothing I could have done differently to change the situation. 

I also realize now that I shouldn’t have initiated the conversation with my friend until she was ready to approach me herself. I didn’t consider how overwhelming or scary it might have been for her from her perspective. Thank you for helping me see things more clearly.",,"

I’m on the highest dose of Zoloft that is allowed (was on it prior to pregnancy, increased it in 3rd trimester and again a month ago). 
I think I’m actually getting worse. Caring for the baby is getting objectively easier, but I am so fucking low. I can’t stop thinking about how she doesn’t like me, how I’ve made a horrible mistake, and regret having her. I know that I did love her before, I know I felt joy and overwhelming love. It’s gone though. I don’t feel anything when I’m with her. It doesn’t feel like she came out of my body at all. We are supposed to have this bond and she seems honestly happier with other people. She is incredibly fussy for me to get her to nap, which makes me have thoughts of hurting her (I haven’t and I won’t). But for others she falls asleep easily. This is a huge trigger right now.

569,"She’s not technically mine. I came into her life when she was a toddler just three years ago. Her mom isn’t in the picture, really. I took on the maternal role by choice. Everything was fine until my third trimester. She started becoming difficult in her behavior and the way she’d speak to me and that’s when DH started expecting more out of me, except I was exhausted from all the swelling I had and being physically uncomfortable all the time.

I’m 9 weeks pp and I’m having the hardest time getting her ready for school without her screaming at me while I tend to a hungry, screaming baby. And then picking her up from school is a struggle because it’s when baby needs his nap but he gets so overtired and cries and screams in the pick up lane and all I can do is cry with him. There have been many times where after I pick her up I have to pull into the parking lot to tend to my baby for about 30 minutes. I tried talking to DH about having her ride the bus in the afternoon as it would help me tremendously. He said no. 

Also the only other way I’m able to keep her from fighting with me is to let her watch tv or play her game. But when I tell her it’s time to stop, the screaming starts back up. But when I talk to DH about it he says I need to spend more time with her and that I’m giving her too much freedom. But all I want to do is nap after looking over a colicky baby.

On weekends when he has to work a lot, I pack up to go stay at my parents. I take the baby with me, but I can’t even leave until she gets out of school and I have to take her with me. I wouldn’t mind doing so, but she is always so disrespectful and rude to my family and when I scold her, all she does is scream so that she doesn’t have to hear me. I always end up feeling bad for staying with my family because of this. I cry all time.

Even now as I type this, she keeps knocking on my locked bedroom door. I just needed a moment to cry in peace while I put baby for his nap. But she keeps knocking on the door, which wakes up the baby, and I have to put him to sleep *again*. I just can’t stop crying and there are so many times where I want to just miss a pickup and go stay at my parents house for a few days with my baby *but I can’t*. 

I never expected to feel this way, but I also didn’t expect postpartum to hit me like this. Nothing I do is working with her. I’ve tried backing off and letting her do her own thing to keep the peace, but my husband gets upset with me for letting her watch TV all day.
Nothing is good enough. I can’t be the parent he wants me to be. But I can’t tell him that. I can’t tell him I want to die and that the only thing keeping me alive right now is our baby. I can’t tell him I don’t trust him alone with our baby and daughter because he hands the baby to her to hold while she’s standing up. She’s six year old and too young to hold a newborn if she isn’t sitting on the couch. I’ve had to take the baby back every time because I’m so afraid she’ll drop him. He’s even tried to make her hold the baby when she’s in a bad mood a few times and I’ve had to step in and say I’ll take the baby because I feel like she’ll drop him or throw him out of anger.

571,"3 weeks pp. I'm all over the place. I'm not happy or sad but I want to cry. I feel happy when I look at him and hold him but I also feel so detached from everything. We had a good couple days when we got home from the hospital, my mom had to leave the second day and I miss her so much. Me and my boyfriend are doing okay but probably better on his side. Last week I walked in on him watching porn which 2 months ago wouldn't have bothered me but with my pp body, trying to breastfeed and pump to build up supply for work and then he's been on his phone so much, it hurt a lot. So many past and new insecurities came roaring up in my head, I shut down for a few days before I just started hysterically crying about it. He comforted me and apologized even though I told him he didn't need to be sorry about it, it's not a boundary that I realized I would have postpartum. 

I don't even necessarily care if he watches it, more just that he does it more discreetly so it's not in my head. But now it's all that's in my head, thanks to my ex who said horrible things about my body and cheated on me multiple times, all starting with him being on his phone alot more. All I can think is that he's looking for better options and I wasn't even good enough before so now I'm definitely not good enough now. And then I feel horrible because my boyfriend doesn't deserve these thoughts. He's the most supportive person I've ever had in my life, and I know he loves me but my brain refuses to accept that he loves me as much as he says.

And I've only been put of the house by myself twice and both were to the grocery store and i was panicking the whole time. But for him he still goes to school, he is going to a friend's birthday on Thursday and for him it's like nothing has changed when he's not home. He is beyond helpful and makes sure to give me my time to sleep when he gets up in the morning, he changes diapers, does tummy time and cooks food. I just don't know why I can't stop all of these negative thoughts, I want to go back to when we first got home and I wasn't thinking like this.

585,"I (21f) am 4 months postpartum with my first child. Everything seemed to be going great for the first few months, I got decent sleep when my husband or other family would take the baby, I was able to take care of myself and my kiddo, I ate properly for the most part (which is a huge deal for me because I've always struggled to eat enough). But over the last month or so, everything just feels like it's fallen apart and I don't know what to do. 

I didn't realize what it was at first. I would just get really angry out of nowhere and have to leave my lo in his crib for a few moments so I could step out of the room to calm down. My husband and I have spent a lot of time arguing over pointless things that have nothing to do with anything. My best friend and I (who happens to be our roommate in whose house we live) have had several arguments over stupid shit. 

And then all of a sudden about a week ago it hit me like a freight train. I kinda just sat on my bed, a little dazed at the realization of why I've been so upset. I thought about all the things that might have led up to that moment and realized how blind I'd been to my own emotions...

I've always struggled to keep my space clean but then I'd realized just how dirty my house is. I've never been consistent with scheduling but I realized how late I stay in ben now, and how it feels impossible to get up to do anything. A few weeks ago, I'd been physically ill and kept blaming my lack of motivation on recovery but I don't think that's the case anymore.

And my baby spends significantly more time crying now than he has in the past thanks to sleep regression and what I think might be the onset of teething, maybe? 

And then to top it all off, I tried to get help today and it sorta just ended in failure. I'd seen decent reviews on BetterHelp but it wasn't until after I'd payed the $50+ for the week that I'd found out how they don't hold up to their own standards so I canceled it without even thinking about it and now I feel guilty for spending the money to begin with.

Anyways, I guess I just needed to get this out there just in case my mental state decides to completely crash and burn...

Does anyone else feel this way this long after having a baby? I thought postpartum depression was an immediate thing? Everyone has always told me that if you don't get depressed right after birth then you won't experience postpartum depression... 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has responded, it means a lot to know that I'm not in this alone.

595,"I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Postpartum_Depression/comments/1b75ack/my_experience_with_zurzuvae/) so helpful when I was deciding whether or not to take medication for my postpartum depression, I wanted to add my own experience so other folks looking for help have more information.

TL;DR this medication saved me. I feel like myself again, and the side effects were tolerable. I will shout its praise from the rooftops

**Background**

I gave birth in September. FTM, mid 30s, I had an easy pregnancy. I've had several bouts of depression over the course of my life and struggle greatly with anxiety.  I have always been resistant to taking SSRIs due to a bad experience with Zoloft years ago and being impatient with how long they take to work if you respond badly to one.

I had a rough birth and the first few weeks of postpartum were mostly survival mode, but I started feeling the old ugly feelings of depression getting stronger and stronger around week 4. Absolute feelings of failure, crying a lot, just unable to feel any joy. Feeling way too overwhelmed, weeping when I would look at my beautiful daughter because I felt like I was failing her. Failing at everything . Along with strong feelings of self harm which really scared me because I've never had that before. I got flagged by the depression screen at my 6 week appointment and my doctor suggested Zurzuvae. I was intrigued by the short dosage timeframe (you only have to take it for 14 days) and went and did all my internet research on it. I decided to try to get it.

My insuranced needed a prior authorization, but the process all happened behind the scenes. My regular pharmacy couldn't fill the order so they sent it to a specialty pharmacy. The sticker cost was $16k!!! My copay would have been $60, but the pharmacy was able to apply a manufacturer coupon and it cost me $0.

**Administration and side effects**

You have to take it at night (my doctor said it was fine to take with dinner like 6-7pm but be prepared to zonk out after, more on that later) and with a lot of fat in a 400+ calorie meal so it absorbs properly. I found this easy to do! I would rotate through some mixture of the following if my dinner wasn't fatty enough: avocado toast, a couple hard boiled eggs and strips of bacon, or a couple spoons of peanut butter and a slice of cheese, a serving of cashews... ""girl dinner"". I usually took it around 8pm.

It made me SUPER drowsy the first few nights. Like I would fall asleep on the couch within 30-1hr of taking it. For the rest of the course of medication I found I could take it a little earlier in the evening and it didn't affect my sleep at all. It made me sleep SUPER deeply regardless. My husband does overnight baby duty and good thing - I literally would barely wake up to the baby. (I do think if she cried loud enough I would have but it was crazy how hard it was to rouse me).  I am lucky to have an incredible partner who was able to support me and allow me to get deep sleep every night so I could focus on healing my mind.

The morning grogginess was a whole other level. It was beyond grogginess. I was very wobbly and felt drunk most mornings - especially if my sleep was disrupted. If you've ever taken a Benadryl and stayed up afterwards, it felt like that. They are serious about not driving within 12 hours of taking it and I would wholeheartedly echo that recommendation, your reaction time is very off. I also had a weird side effect where my grip felt really weak in the mornings? Like it was hard to grasp things and I was kinda trembly. That went away after an hour or so every morning, and has not persisted since I stopped the medication. I was able to care normally for the baby during the day.

**Did it actually work?**

YES!!!! By day 2 I already felt it working. I literally felt my spirits lifting day by day. I stopped weeping. I started smiling. By day 4-5 that hateful voice in my head was already silenced, I started speaking to myself with more compassion and feeling like things were funny again. It felt like I was emerging from a deep, black pit and could see the sunlight again. By day 10 I remember distinctly thinking ""Wow, I feel so HAPPY"" and realizing I hadn't felt that in weeks. The best way to describe it ultimately is I FELT LIKE MYSELF AGAIN. It felt like it was a different person talking to me in the mirror every day while I was in the grips of postpartum depression and now I feel completely back to myself.

**Breast milk**

I was pumping at the time and ultimately decided to continue feeding my baby milk (we supplement 50/50 with formula). The studies on how much pass into breastmilk and what the effects may be are limited, but my pediatrician said she was comfortable with it and I trust her opinion. No effects noticed on baby, she is happy as can be and eating and sleeping well. I personally believed the benefits of continuing to give her breastmilk outweighed the unknown risks, and I was reassured by my pediatrician's response. I saw no effect on my milk supply negative or positive, but I was able to relax more and stop stressing / spiraling about pumping so much (iykyk).

**Other thoughts**

Other than the morning grogs, I had no other side effects and the benefits were immense. I will say it hasn't helped much with the anxiety side of things, I am still working through that. My doc warned it might not, so I was not surprised. I am doing talk therapy and starting on Buspar. But I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling with depression, I could not believe how well it worked and I am so thankful my doc recommended it.

I am curious to see how long the effects last (It's only been a few days since I stopped taking it). I can do an update post in a couple weeks if anybody is interested.

I’ve been dealing with postpartum rage as well that has been going on since 4 weeks postpartum. I am on medication and I am in therapy… just trying to be proactive since I have a history of mental illness and severe ppd from my first (5yo). 

The past two months have been HARD. But it’s not from the newborn… she’s been a dream baby. She’s been so easy! It’s my 5yo. It seems like everything she does just gets on my nerves. She is rude and sometimes mean. She’s been extra needy, too, which I get she’s a little kid and used to being an only child but it’s the whining I cannot stand. I get so worked up, like my body gets tense, I get filled with rage and it’s like I actually feel my blood pressure rise. I remind myself that she’s not annoying, I’m just annoyed…. But no. She’s annoying and there are times I cannot stand her. Im sick of hearing “mom” and “mama” every 30 fucking seconds. I feel so awful about it and I’m trying to work through it. I love her more than anything, but now I’m finding it hard to balance the baby and her at the same. I snap at times, but I’m working on coping mechanisms to control it, but I always apologize when I do. I try to turn it into a teaching moment and it also helps me to talk through it with her, but now she’s calling me a bad mom. It hurts my heart and a lot of times I feel like I am. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a mom. 

I dread picking her up from school every single day because it’s just the baby, her, and me for at least 3 hours until my husband gets home. I love her smile and how excited she gets when she sees me in car line, but then we get home and it’s like she purposely pushes all of my buttons and tries to make me mad. She thinks it’s hilarious. I will ask her what she wants for snack, something to drink, what she wants to do, but she never wants anything until I sit down to nurse the baby and now I’m stuck. I tell her she has to wait because I already asked her at least 3 times, but then she will throw a tantrum. Some days are really good, but others make me want to drive away and not come back. I love her soooooooo much, but why can’t I stand her a lot of the time?

599,"I apologise in advance for the length of this post. I just need to release all of this somewhere.

My baby boy is almost 11 months old and he is the sweetest, easiest baby and I love him to pieces. But I have found motherhood so hard from the start. I have suffered from anxiety for a long time, with periods of low mood, but things have been so so bad probably since I got pregnant.

The early days PP were terrible. Then things got a little easier and I started to feel more like myself again a few months in, but it’s been a constant struggle to stay afloat. Im in a constant state of burnout and overwhelm with all the responsibility and decision making, and have been finding staying at home very isolating. Every now and again I have brief periods of feeling a degree of positivity, but then the persistent low mood sets in again. 

I live in the UK and since autumn has set in seasonal depression has hit on top of PPD, then I lost a pet last week and now I am just at rock bottom. I can’t bear to be in the house alone with my thoughts anymore, but my baby is still non-mobile and has a nap schedule which means I am somewhat limited in what I can do to get out and about. 

I’ve started going back to work 2 days a week and this helped somewhat, but I’m a veterinary nurse and lost the pet I’m currently grieving at my workplace, so even this now feels tainted to me. 

I’ve also started just abandoning morning nap and getting out to baby groups etc or seeing a friend, because I just find mornings at home so hard, but then the naps are off for the rest of the day which comes with other challenges trying to keep a tired baby entertained for hours. 

I do a lot of walking to try and get sunlight (although as I said in the UK it’s so limited right now) and exercise, I’m on medication and see a therapist. But I’m so sick of feeling like this. I want to experience joy again. I look at other people and wish I could be happy like them. I feel like I’m constantly fighting through a fog and it’s so much effort. 

What else can I do? Has anybody else come through the other side of this? I just don’t know what more I can do and I’m so tired of feeling this way. ",,"apologise advance length post need release somewhere

I stopped taking care of myself, eating, making doctor's appointments etc. My husband was obviously really concerned that I was dropping my responsibility of taking care of myself and my unborn child and he tried to take on the these I was leaving behind. Immediately after birth, I suffered from a severe spinal headache and what I now know to be postpartum depression. I don't remember much, but my husband has told me that he had to make me breast feed my daughter even though that was my plan and desire and it was terrifying for him because our daughter would not take a bottle. He felt helpless. At the time I was constantly feeling unsupported by him even though he was doing 90% of the work with our newborn and waiting on me while I recovered from my headache. After the headache subsided, the depression remained and when he tried to talk to me about it or have me seek help, I denied everything and blamed him for what I was going through. I finally started seeing a therapist and taking meds about 6 months after my daughter was born but I still persisted in trying to place blame on him whenever I was acting or treating him poorly. This caused him severe emotional trauma and I am only beginning to understand and take accountability for the things that I did and said after birth. We still have horrible relationship issues mostly stemming from my not listening to him in the beginning stages of our ordeal and not taking any accountability for my actions until very recently. I wanted to hear the opinions and experiences of others who went through postpartum and how it affected both sides of the relationship. Were you able to heal?

610,"I am a single mother by choice. I conceived via IVF.
My pregnancy was not too bad, I had horrible hyperemesis and had preeclampsia  the very end of my pregnancy and posteclampsia. I had a c-section with my mother with me, then was immediately alone with my son. I barely slept for 5 days before baby blues hit. I was crying at the drop of a hat. At one point I cried because I saw a tree. I was exhausted and my son would be wide awake from 11pm to 3am every night. I was struggling as I didn’t have help. After the first month past things got easier. I lucky out immensely. He started sleeping through the night at 1 month. Our sleep regressions have been minimal. He eats well. He has CMPA and reflux, but all in all he is so good. He isn’t a crier, he longs just hanging out. Super chill. It wasn’t until right before the 5 month mark that I started to go down a dark road, it felt like the edges of my sanity were starting to fray. I knew what was happening and I could see I was being overly emotional and all over the place. Still no one said anything to me, but then again almost everyone pulled away from me. It wasn’t until a couple weeks later that I put the pieces together that it was PPD. I went to the doctors and got meds and started them right away, it was night and day.
When I talked to the people who were around me they went “ya we saw it, you stopped doing stuff for us”. Which was a whole other blow that I had to take. People only paid attention because I stopped doing things for them?

And that he only heart reacted his colleague’ s message because she was talking about our baby, he offered to show me the whole conversation. But I refused.

A few night later, we were cuddling, and this time our baby stayed in my mum’s room. Still nothing happened. I tried to touch him but he pushed my hand away saying he’s tired and then just cuddled me. I feel like I have no dignity left at this point and feel disgusted of myself.

The next day I messaged and asked him what did he mean when he said he wanted to take it slow, I asked how long, he said a week ( a few has almost gone past). I don’t understand, he used to have high libido and was the one who initiated it most of the time and now he just keeps rejecting me.

I yelled at a stranger in front of my 11-week-old I mean, really lost my marbles, screaming at the top of my lungs, I almost punched her. Why isn't important, nothing should cause that.  I did it in front of my partner and he says I violated a huge boundary. He hates public scenes and is embarrassed by me. I embarrassed myself. 

Then I tried to take a bath today during her nap and didn't hear my baby wake up and cry. My husband had to take her while he was on a work call. I then realized I forgot to change her. She had two blow outs back to back this morning (which I changed and cleaned her) and then she sat in the same diaper for 7 1/2 hours. She was leaking pee and I thought we had to size up diapers until my husband went to log the heavy pee diaper and realized my neglect. 

I feel so awful. I've been battling daydreams of suicide since the screaming incident but know that isn't an option now that I have my daughter. While I do think she would be better off without me, it would be too much for my husband to handle. And I think about my own mom and how much it would hurt her. So I have to stay alive, knowing I'm a worthless, terrible mother. Maybe it's a fit punishment for me?

She's a happy baby in spite of me, I don't deserve her. I just wish I could be happy for her because that's what she deserves. 

Living inside my mind is torture. I have a therapist but she cares more about the baby than me. I have a history of treatment-resistant depression and faulty serotonin receptors so SSRIs don't work. I've done ketamine therapy successfully pre baby but it didn't seem to work postpartum. I finally started zuzurvae but had to pump and dump for two weeks (tomorrow is the last day) and LO was vomiting the formula.

When I was talking to my therapist about it she recommended I stop the zurzuvae (at the time of the session I thought it was helping) when I texted her to ask for an additional session (we were every other week) after the screaming incident she asked about if the baby was keeping down formula and not about how I was doing. Then she canceled the extra session (reasonably) because she's sick. (There's a part of me that thinks she's avoiding me because she thinks I'm a bad mom too and doesn't know how to support me). So long and short to say, I'm trying therapy but it's making me feel more guilty and selfish, and I don't think the meds are working either. 

I'm so miserable and I know I'm making my husbands life awful by being like this. He's dealing with his own mental health issues and taking on way more than most fathers because I'm such a failure. 

To top it off I've developed urge urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence. I can't trust my own body and feel like I can't leave the house. I tried talking to my mom about it and she just said ""oh dear"" and changed the subject. She sent us some soup on Grubhub, she's a good mom just not good at the emotional support. (I'm in pelvic floor therapy, I started at 20 weeks pregnant because of a predisposition to these issues and it still happened) 

Who do I think I am bringing a child into this world? I'm not equipped for this, she's going to have an absent, depressed mother her whole life and I've ruined another soul. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this even. Maybe a catharsis? A confirmation that I'm awful. I can't stop replaying all the horrible things I've done. My husband took a cute photo of her today and all I can think about is that she's sitting in a full diaper in the photo. I cry every time I look at it.

628,"Yeah idk. Me and my SO met on hinge 2 years ago. We kind of instantly hit it off and have been inseparable since. In fact we got engaged fairly quickly and shortly after our engagement I had a car accident leaving me unable to walk for almost 5 months. We also discovered we were pregnant. He was amazing the entire time and took care of me in ways that nobody should even have too until we’re old and sick. I will forever be grateful for him for that. 

Well our baby came in June. Everything has been great and we love him so much and our relationship has never been better honestly. Our sex life is phenomenal, our late night pillow talk is back to how it was when we were dating, we have date nights together and we text more because I’m home with the baby and he’s at work. 

I am and have been suffering for quite some time with PPA. It been a little better baby wise, was hoooorrrible for the first month or two, and has now switched to other things including self image issues and my need to try to look better. I’m at my highest weight ever and as a girl who used to be able to go get her hair, nails and lashes done whenever I’m now a mom with very minimal time for myself. It’s been really hard. I’ve also been trying to loose weight bc it will make me feel better over all to be healthier, especially with what trouble I’m having with the repercussions of my injuries, that loosing the weight will make and help me get around better as a mom. (Before pregnancy 185, before birth 260lbs, now 240lbs and still going) 

So lately I’ve been feeling insecure in my relationship even though everything seems good with us. A lot has happened to us in our timeframe but I know we do love each other a lot. When I think about him (prior to this all of a sudden insecurities) he makes me feel safe, loved, heard and cared for. We truly believe we’re soulmates and I wouldn’t want to do life without him. But..

The other day we took the baby to his work for a holiday thanksgiving party. He introduced me and the baby and slipped up and called me Beth. Well my middle name is Beth, but his ex girlfriend who cheated on him with his bf while they were cling togethers name is also Beth. He corrected himself super fast and seemed extremely embarrassed and I didn’t even say anything to him about it because we were at his job and I didn’t want to argue about something like that when we never argue. We always talk things out. But for some reason my PPA wouldn’t even let me bring it up. It was like if I shattered our perfect relationship with an argument about it or mentioned  it I was gonna loose my mind. 

Another thing, he’s been weird about my best-friend. She currently going through a break up with her baby daddy. We both love her son like our own as he spends a lot of time with us. He keeps jokingly saying after we spend the day with them that he’s been “thinking” and that he and his mother (my bff) should move in with us. He says it jokingly as if he just wants them to do that bc he loves her kid but the amount of times he brings it up is starting to bother me. He also said something recently like it’s fine ik you guys love each other y’all can get married to each other and I’ll just marry you. Like no I don’t want to live and be with just you and not another woman thanks! Even tho I know he’s kidding it rubs me the wrong way?? 

Idk outside of all of this like I said has been great. We want another baby, he doesn’t even want to wait lol, and we want to get on with our plans to get married. He really is my bestfriend. Our families are planing to spend the holidays together and I’m just upset w myself for not just speaking up and letting myself fester in this way. Idk why it’s happening and it’s very unlike me. I think I’d I brought both of these things up hed be kinda shocked? 

Idk I just need advice and someone to talk this through w who is unbiased. Maybe someone who understands or has also had PPA or anxiety. 

We were both in really long relationships before eachother. Not ones that were good either. His ex cheated like I said and mine might have as he ended up with one of my ex bestfriends as well, so I think that that might have to do something with how I’m feeling as well. My ex and my ex bff getting together was a shock early into my pregnancy and I know I prob shouldn’t have cared but I was just taken aback that they could do that after being friends (10 years) and my bf (8 years) for so long… I think that I really felt blindsided and thought I knew my ex better than that and it’s seeping into this relationship. Like am I really just that bad at knowing peoples trie intentions when two very prominent relationships of mine ended and then they ended up together. Idk

I feel sick lol. Someone help I feel crazy ",,"yeah idk meet hinge   year ago kind instantly hit inseparable since fact get engage fairly quickly shortly engagement car accident leave unable walk almost   month also discover pregnant amazing entire time take care way nobody even old sick forever grateful

This question is mainly for the moms. Does anyone else feel uneasy at the idea of your children being left alone with male relatives. For whatever reason I don't feel comfortable with my son being left with alone with any of his 4 grandfather's. I'm constantly watching their every move. FYI I don't have a history of childhood trauma. I do however have postpartum anxiety/depression.

635,"Im 32 years old. Im a ICU and emergency room nurse. On January 22 2024 I was 7 months pregnant, I had hyperemesis gravidarum and was struggling to work, constantly nauseous and throwing up 6 times a day. I could barely eat, and missed a lot of work hurting me financially. My baby stopped moving while I was at work. He was stillborn at my job 2 days later on 1/24/24. I was completely broken as a person after my son died. A part of me died in the delivery room with him that day. I was horrified and traumatized. My pregnancy had been healthy outside of the hyperemesis and baby had checked out totally fine on ultrasound and tests. I got pregnant again very quickly, about 6 weeks after my son was stillborn. This pregnancy I had hypermesis again. It was even worse. I was throwing up 20 times a day. I ended up on a continuous medication pump as well as IV fluids. I had to take unpaid medical leave from work. Thank god I had short time disability, it only pays at 60%. Once again I suffered financially. This time I was out of work for almost my entire pregnancy. I tried to go back to work at 25 weeks but was violently ill at work. Constantly in the bathroom throwing up and throwing up in patient rooms. My anxiety during this pregnancy was horrendous. I worried constantly that this baby would die too. I was so sick and depressed and isolated. All I could do was lay in bed, throw up and cry. My dogs took care of me while my partner worked overtime trying to help us financially. I lost my health insurance. We struggled to put food on the table. My baby was born early at 36 weeks last week. She is beautiful and perfect and alive and I’m so relieved. The hyperemesis went away as soon as she was born, I was so relieved. I got discharged from the hospital. First day was happy and joyful. The next morning my car was repossessed. The financial  struggles continue, I have no money. My savings are long gone. The depression hit along with the hormone drop. On day 3 I had nightmares so horrible. I dreamed about my son being born dead over and over. I dreamed my daughter was born dead too. I woke up screaming and crying. I’m still too afraid to sleep. I feel so overwhelmed and depressed. I have been thinking about suicide constantly. I did this while I was sick too. It’s just this constant thought, what a relief from all the financial hardship it would be. I feel so guilty for thinking this way. I should be grateful my rainbow baby is here safely, but I just feel so depressed and sad. I feel so crazy and anxious inside.

637,"There are a lot of threads on Zurzuvae but not a lot with research or updates, so hoping this thread can be more useful. I almost didn’t take the med because of threads I read and I am so glad I did. 

Background: 3 months pp with my second with terrible PPD. Lots of suicidal ideations. Crying constantly. Instant rage. History of depression and have been on Zoloft or Wellbutrin prior. 

TLDR: On day 12, worked at day 4 and has kept working. If you’re experiencing PPD/PPA I promise you aren’t the problem. Your brain is failing you. Reach out for help! 

What I learned before taking Zurzuvae: 

The biggest side effect is  somnolence but only 36% of people experienced this (in clinical trial). Other threads make it seem like it knocks everyone out. They did a study and found 9 hours after taking it’s as if your blood alcohol level is 0.05 (legal limit 0.08). It needs to be take with a high fat meal (24-50%) and 400-1000 calories because it is fat soluble. The normal dose is 50 mg, they did have some people drop down to 40 mg with similar affect. It costs about $16,000 without insurance, my insurance denied it at first but approved it after appealing and no cost to me. The original study the moms weren’t breastfeeding. There are a few tiny studies with breast feeding moms and the amount is breast milk is less than 1% weight adjusted, so like taking 0.5 mg dose for us and it doesn’t reach that level until day 5. We tried to learn when the drug peaks in my blood to reduce exposure but they say it’s between 3 and 16 hours so too broad to say. They observed no negative affects with breastfeeding. It is a synthetic 

Side Effects (% of patients in trials): somnolence (36), dizziness (13), diarrhea (6), fatigue (5), UTI (5), memory impairment ( 3), abdominal pain (3), tremor (2), hypoesthesia (2), muscle twitch (2), myalgia/muscle pain (2) 

Side Effects I experienced: dizziness, memory impairment, muscle twitch 

Started Zurzuvae 50mg and here is my day by day breakdown:

Day 1: Took at 7pm (once kids were asleep) with high fat meal. Pretty shortly after felt drunkish or just off. I was worried I may not wake up overnight but did without any issues and was able to take care of the baby. 

Day 2: woke up and felt pretty normal all day. Still depressed. Took second dose at 5:30 pm since it didn’t knock me out like I expected. 

Day 3: Extreme depression (maybe from coming off Wellbutrin) and felt really off. Didn’t feel like I could safely drive all day. Talked to my doctor and discussed dropping to 25 mg but worried it wouldn’t be as effective due to limit data, so tried 50 mg again at 5:30pm. 

Day 4: woke up with energy (despite terrible newborn sleep) and didn’t feel depressed at all. No thoughts of wanting to kill myself. Able to handle unpredictability without crying. 

Day 5: tired but not depressed. I did stay up about 3 hours after taking it and had insomnia which I have seen others report. But Kids having meltdowns and I felt able to handle it. Actually handled the chaos better than my husband for once. All the side effects have gone away despite an occasional headache. 

Day 6-11: no depression or anxiety. I’m the happiest I have been since before my first was born 2 years ago. Have been taking everyday at 5:30 pm. 

Day 12: having moments where I feel like my depression is coming back but not certain. Very dizzy. Difficulties functioning during the day. 

Day 13: depression is back, so sad, and crying a lot. Hoping this is just a temporary swing. Dizziness and weakness again. Very tough day. I didn’t take my last dose bc I couldn’t handle another day of the side effects. 

Day 14: first 24 hours without meds. Feeling much better! Not as good as day 4. It seems like some rebound depression or mood swings are normal while brain rewires. 

Day 14-21: off zurzuvae. Definitely still battling some depression but the intensity is soo much better. I had depression before pregnancy so wondering if Surzuvae fixed dangerous postpartum depression and now I’m just battling normal depression. Started low dose Zoloft.

I would never actually hurt her but I hate that the thought even crosses my mind. during the day I become irritated so quickly because she's such an active baby and literally will not stop touching/climbing me or biting me, pulling my hair, pinching me, etc. I feel that if I had more help, I would be a better mom.

642,"I just have to get this out here because I don't think people really know or can understand what I went through. 

I gave birth in 2020 and experienced a good 3 months with my baby. I had crying spells due to a broken family. My mom died suddenly in a car crash in 2018 and I guess my family just couldn't love me the same.

I was basically alone with a newborn, which was fine until it wasn't.

I stopped breastfeeding at about month 5, cold turkey. I did not wean my baby off like I should have. I didn't have any experience and I didn't have the support around me to help me to understand what and how I should have done things.

At about month 6, I started to feel completely disconnected to my baby. I didn't know what was happening. I eventually tried reaching out to my aunt for help, but she wasn't talking to me. I kept to a routine where I fed him and bathed him. But I didn't really interact with him, which was different from the months I had breastfed him. I felt like we were two peas in a pod then all of the sudden I couldn't hold him without feeling tired, and I didn't want to be tired.

I kept him in one of those baby gardens, like a giant pack and play, with all of his toys cause I was deathly afraid that he would severely hurt himself.

I had known about ppd, but I thought that it was like general depression and I had been depressed before but this was completely different. I was hallucinating, at one point my baby started to talk to me, my 5 month old baby answered questions with a yes and a no. I thought he was possessed.

Don't get me wrong I was scared at first. I went to the kitchen, placed him in his bouncers and just started sobbing, wailing, praying for God to give me back my baby. My baby looked at me with pity at one point in the night.

Eventually, this passed and he returned to what I think was his normal. But every so often he would look at me with this smug smile, like he was better than me.

I figured I was just going crazy on top of not being able to be the mother I wanted to be with him. But I still loved him with all of my heart regardless of what he looked like to me.

Fast forward to almost his 2nd birthday, I was being evicted from our house. I had made plans to go to a university 1.5 hours away and was looking for housing in that town. I couldn't hold a job because I couldn't stop crying while I was working. I constantly thought that I had somehow killed my baby, that either his death or my death was coming. 

I heard voices in my head that sounded like my family. I didnt want to hear from the family that shunned me, I thought they were all mad at me and was constantly confused and scared when I would hear them.

I visited family and told them that I was getting evicted but all I got was, you can't live with us. My estranged dad's wife asked me, while we were driving back from shopping, to their house, with her teenage daughter in the car ""Why don't you come to college in the town we live in?"" But since they didn't ask me to live with them, I didn't know that she was asking me to live with them. I said ""No"" as I had already registered to go to a college. Later, I found out this was supposed to be a formal offer to live with them...

So, I went back to the house I was getting evicted from and looked for housing in the college town. I thought I had found a good prospect and had borrowed $2500 from my grandma for the down payment and first months rent. It turned out to be a scam. So, I went to the college town with my child and thought I could book a hotel and look for housing around there. I ended up not being able to find housing, so I thought I could stay at an extended stay hotel. 

When I went to the extended stay hotel to confirm our room for the month, a cop car pulled up and brought someone from the hotel down in cuffs, so I canceled my reservation and started looking elsewhere. 

I ended up booking an Airbnb for a week, which took $1200 out of the money I had for housing.

While staying at the Airbnb, my neighbor told me that the owner of the house I was being evicted from started taking all of my stuff out of the house. 

I was super overwhelmed, so I stayed in the college town while all of my memories, clothes, and furniture got stolen or taken to the dump. My neighbor said that they had put a tarp on my stuff, but I didn't have the means or the mindset to move all of my stuff and take it to storage by myself. I didn't even reach out for help then as I had asked for it multiple times and had been denied. 

At this point, I had lost everything and barely had a penny to my name. I called my best friend's mom who had helped us move in to our house. I asked for money, but I didn't tell her what was going on. I could barely think straight. She said she would think about it. I called my best friend in a panic, it was a couple nights before her wedding and she told me her mom said no.

I stayed in the Airbnb until the last day. The cleaning lady came and I had it in my mind that they wouldn't throw out a single mother who had lost everything, really I was thinking that the house I was staying in was owned by my best friend's mom, who owns property over 600 miles away...

The cleaning lady came and I wouldn't let her in, stating ""I'll clean the house ""

Eventually the cops came and kicked us out. I didn't want to get arrested so I grabbed my baby and started walking down the street in our pajamas. 

When the cops left I went back, as my car was in the driveway of the Airbnb.

I got in the car and started driving, not knowing what I was going to do.

I called my grandma trying to get help, but she didn't answer. 

Eventually I came to the towns airport. My ex was an airplane mechanic who lived 600 miles away. I thought he was going to randomly show up at this airport that we had stopped at.

I took my baby to the bathroom to change his diaper. When I realized he didn't have diapers in his diaper bag, I broke. No one was at this part of the the airport, it was like for private customers, the only person there was a janitor.

Me and the janitor locked eyes, then I left to go to the car without my baby. I left him with the janitor.

I drove back to the Airbnb and called the cops, saying ""I lost my baby at the airport."" 

The cops came to the Airbnb and arrested me. 

My baby was taken into DCS custody and I was taken to jail. 

This is also what PPD looks like.

I’m a 29-year-old first-time mom, and this past year has been the hardest of my life. My first pregnancy was high-risk, and I went through it alone because my child’s father didn’t want to be involved. Despite almost losing my baby, by the grace of God, he made it out healthy.

But just four days after giving birth (four weeks early), I lost my grandmother, who I was extremely close to—right before my birthday. Then, only two days later, I lost my brother to a blood clot in his lungs.

The grief and stress have been unbearable. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum anxiety (PPA). I started on Zoloft, but the side effects made things worse, and my doctor switched me to Lexapro. Now, I feel trapped in my own body.

It feels like no one cares—my job, my friends, even my family. I’m at a breaking point. I don’t know how to keep going, and I feel so alone in all of this.

I just want my son to be loved and cared for, but I feel like I’m failing him. I’m desperate for advice, encouragement, or just someone to remind me that things can get better.

646,"Hi all. 

I did not have a great start to breastfeeding as I didn’t get a session with the lactation consultant before leaving the hospital. We were re-admitted at 48 hours old due to jaundice and baby losing 13% of his body weight. I pumped and fed around the clock (they actually wanted me to try breastfeeding on top of that but it was too much). 

Saw LC multiple times at the hospital and a clinical setting and whenever I tried to feed (with nipple shields can’t BF without them) it would be frustrating because he wouldn’t be getting enough, he was hurting me even with the nipple shields and I still had to bottle feed after.

I think this gave me an aversion to nursing because I no longer feel like I want to or want to be the sole food source for baby and I’m enjoying having others help me when I need a break or nap. 

I’ve been pumping occasionally throughout the day but the milk only amounts to a couple feeds during the day. I hate the feeling of engorgement and I’m not producing that much (probably because I don’t pump that frequently). I totally can’t pump every 3 hours like the recommendation and now I’m up with baby in the morning, feeling engorged and the pain and swelling is really bothering me and making me upset. 

I don’t think this classifies as DMER and while I haven’t gotten a formal diagnosis for any postpartum mental health condition but wondering if anyone else really doesn’t desire to breastfeed like me when I feel like everyone I talk or posts something online talks about how much they want to breastfeed and how hard they’re working to increase supply when I really don’t feel like I want to or have the energy. I also miss my pre-pregnancy/breastfeeding boobs a lot and I think the body image aspect has a big effect on my postpartum experience. Overall feeling low and heavily relying on others around me for help when I can. ",,"hi

647,"Just a little something I ended up writing at midnight, and I thought this was a place where I could share it without being judged.



The room was cold, the lights too bright,  
I had dreamed of calm, of a softer night.  
I’d planned to breathe, to feel her near,  
But things unraveled, sharp and clear.

They said it was time, no words to spare,  
An urgent need, they cut with care.  
The dream of natural washed away,  
As I watched my hopes dissolve that day.

No one asked, no one knew,  
The battle inside that no one could view.  
I tried to hold on, tried to be strong,  
But everything felt deeply wrong.

My body failed, or so I thought,  
A scar remained where I had fought.  
She’s here, she’s healthy, perfect, and small,  
Yet I still feel like I lost it all.

The shame seeps in like a quiet storm,  
How can I feel distant from a life I’ve borne?  
Her tiny hands, her newborn cries,  
Yet something inside me silently dies.

I didn’t talk, didn’t share,  
The guilt inside is too much to bear.  
Everyone smiles, says she’s a dream,  
But they don’t see my silent scream.

I love her deeply, more than words can say,  
But why does my heart still feel this way?  
There’s a distance I can’t explain,  
A fragile bond wrapped in pain.

They tell me I’m lucky, she’s safe, she’s here,  
But my mind is clouded by fear.  
Did I fail her? Am I enough?  
This journey, it’s been far too rough.

Her eyes meet mine, they’re bright and new,  
And sometimes, I can almost feel it too—  
That connection I thought would be,  
But then the guilt washes over me.

I’m scared of this feeling I can’t shake,  
That I’ve somehow made a mistake.  
I carried her close, through all the strain,  
So why does it feel like I’m lost again?

I should feel proud, relieved, at peace,  
But the fear and guilt, they never cease.  
She’s here, she’s healthy, my baby girl,  
Yet my heart is heavy in this broken world.

Maybe, one day, I’ll feel whole inside,  
The shame and fear will finally subside.  
For now, I’ll hold her, try to heal,  
And hope one day, I’ll truly feel.",,"little something end write midnight think place could share without judge

656,"I’m going to be 5 months pp in 2 weeks. I gained about 15kgs by the last month of pregnancy and lost 10 right after giving birth. However, as I started breastfeeding and my supply established I gained all the weight back. I’ve been eating almost the same except for adding 2 eggs to my diet for protein. 

I was very fit pre pregnancy and lifting pretty heavy and doing HIIT regularly. Unfortunately I had to stop working out at 20weeks pregnant due to a hematoma. And now I feel like I’ve lost everything I spent years building. I’m not able to do pushups, one round  of HIIT makes me feel like I’m going to die. Clothes don’t fit the same. My boobs are much bigger and so is my butt(not in a nice way). And the weight just won’t budge.
I miss how I used to be and I just miss feeling healthy and like I can do anything. Now I just feel exhausted and my body starts hurting when I exert myself. My body feels foreign to me at this point. It makes me wonder if this is how it’s going to be forever and I’m having a hard time accepting it. 

I’ve heard moms say you lose weight once you wean off breastfeeding. That’s going to take me another 6 months. My periods are back but very very erratic. Will I never get my body and health back? I already feel like an afterthought and like I’ve lost my sense of self since having the baby.

657,"I'm 19 with a 4 month old baby. I moved in with my boyfriend (now ex) at 18 after only a few months of dating him. I got pregnant right after. Very long story short, the relationship was extremely toxic after that. He didn't want our baby and blamed me for it. He was very controlling and wouldn't let me get a job because he didn't trust me around other guys. He lost his job, though, and refused to get another. So we struggled for food and eventually lost our apartment. I finally ate my pride and just moved back in with my mom. We broke up a few days after I had a 28 hour induced labor for preeclampsia and then a c-section with semi-failed anesthesia, which I also hemorrhaged during. Right now I, embarrassingly, rely on my parents. I'm struggling to get childcare so I can go back to work since nobody can watch my child for long enough. I'm struggling to get a license because nobody has time to teach me. I have one friend who lives states away from me. I am not in the right living situation to be comfortable dating again. My ex does not help provide for my son, but since birth he decided he wants to be a father and see him. I let him visit when possible but I refuse to let him take our son anywhere. 

I know another girl who works with my mom. She's my age and bought a house recently. Met a man a bit ago and moved in together after a month of dating. They're expecting a child now. I also found out that my ex is in a new relationship.

The point of this post is just to vent about how jealous I am. I am very happy for my mom's coworker. She seems very happy. But I'd be lying if I said that it doesn't hurt me to see her living the life that I wanted so badly. Why is it that she gets to be happy bringing her first child into the world but I didn't? Why does my ex get to brag about how happy he is with his new woman to me when I'm struggling to take care of his child? I'm not trying to say that all those mothers with happy relationships and their own homes don't have issues, because I understand that they do, but I just wish I could live some of their life. I want my own home. I want to be in a happy and healthy relationship. But now I don't know if I'll ever be able to even trust another man because my ex hurt me so badly. I just want to know how it feels to be a first time mother and actually feel happy during it (I love my baby more than anything, obviously, just the situation I was in made it hard to be happy).

660,"Hey everyone,

Dad of 2 kids. Most of my friends don't have kids so I’m reaching out here because I start to struggle to keep things together, and I’m hoping some of you may have advice or words of encouragement to share.

My wife recently started experiencing a sudden onset of tinnitus, and it's been a nightmare for her. We’re about 3 months postpartum with our second child, and she’s barely able to get any sleep because of this relentless ringing in her ears. This is all so unexpected. When we had our first, she never had to worry about getting up at night; I took over all the nighttime feedings to help her body and mind recover. It worked well that time around, and we figured the same approach would help us get through this second postpartum phase.

But now, the tinnitus has changed everything. My wife is absolutely exhausted—physically and emotionally. She’s at a breaking point and spends a lot of time crying and hiding away in the bathroom. She's been passing out majority of the days from sheer exhaustion. She’s in such a rough place, and it’s heartbreaking to watch her go through this without being able to make it better. It's also hard in Canada to get access to medical professionals or have them to take you seriously when the symptoms are not life threatening to them.  

Our 2.5-year-old is extremely attached to me because I have been her primary caregiver since birth, so balancing time with them while also caring for the baby is a huge challenge. I recently returned to work from paternity leave and am working from home, but I’m caught between meetings and taking care of the baby. It’s constant juggling, and it feels like I can’t catch a break or truly be present for either kid.

If anyone has experienced postpartum tinnitus or has suggestions on how to get through this rough patch, please let me know. And if nothing else, please send good vibes our way. We could use them right now.

Thanks for listening.",,"hey everyone

662,"My daughter is almost 7 months old and during pregnancy and until she was 5-6 months I was in a good place mentally, very relaxed and happy (besides the fatigue and a few tears from the sleep deprivation, since a few weeks she is waking me up only 2-3x a night in stead of 2-5x).

Is this a combination of 7 months of sleep deprivation and the start of the fall or could this still be PPD?

He is a great dad, and does a lot of things around the house. But I can’t help but get upset and angry over little things and lash out at him by yelling. 

And when he touches me, while I’m breastfeeding or afterwards— I lash out physically without even thinking about it. I have told him many times I do not like to be touched because I’m completely touched out by the breastfeeding but he keeps wanting to initiate intimacy. 

Not sure if this has any effect, but I also just had the Kyleena IUD inserted for birth control.

667,"Today is so incredibly hard. I woke up this morning feeling so anxious before I even got out of bed. I needed to go to the grocery store this morning and also find some time to get in some work for my job. Now that I’ve had this realization that this life isn’t all what I want, my soul aches more than ever to be free.

I have dreams of leaving everything behind and getting on the next plane to a tropical paradise. I would have my daughter with me, and we would arrive and find a nice little outdoor restaurant to get some food. We would meet some of the local people and ask for their recommendations on nice places to sleep that night, and we would figure out the rest from there. No more bills, no more job, no more appointments or grocery shopping, no more chores. No more people to answer to or responsibilities of taking care of a house, possessions, and relationships that I don’t even want and don’t even serve me. Just nothing but freedom to go anywhere I wanted, do anything I wanted, and show my daughter the world.

In his book “Instructions for a New Life,” Markus Rothkranz talks about how all of this is possible. The only issue is that it’s much easier when you don’t have a child and have to get consent from another parent to take the child with you. I mourn that I didn’t have this realization when I was still single and completely unencumbered - if I could go back, I would give away all of my possessions and be on the next plane. I know I will figure it out and I will be free, but I now hate and resent having to wait. 

I had originally planned to make my move after the holidays, but I’m not so sure now. If the rest of my days are anything like today, I don’t think my mental health can take it, which is my top priority for not only myself, but my daughter’s sake. She needs me to be at my best for her, and I’m so committed now than ever to make that happen for her.

So we’ll see if I’m able to wait another six whole weeks or not. I feel a strong surging in my spirit that something may have to happen before then, and maybe it will be the crazy leap of faith that I’m needing to finally catapult my life in the direction it was meant to go.",,"today incredibly hard wake morning feel anxious even get bed need go grocery store morning also find time get work job realization life not want soul ache ever free

668,"So I'm a young-ish mum, I'm 20 and have a 6 month old baby girl. 
I've been struggling with PPD and PPA since giving birth, I've been diagnosed by a professional yet still the only ones who seem to take me seriously on that are my mum and husband. 
I have a traumatic birth, so much so that just going near hospitals will now trigger panic attacks.

[Birth Experience]
I had to have an induced labour as my daughter was overdue by 4 days, however just minutes after my induction I went into labour. The night nurses were insistent that I wasn't in labour as they not long started the induction and it was just normal contractions, that I wouldn't recognise labour as I was a first time mom. I was left on the ward by myself for hours, screaming in pain, eventually I started noticing there was severe blood loss and since no one was answering the call button by my bed I had to try walk to their office, resulting in my collapsing on the floor from exhaustion. Still the night nurses wouldn't take me seriously, calling me dramatic and yelling at me to stop crying. 
3 hours later the day nurse, bless her heart, came in for her shift and rushed in to check on me after hearing me screaming for help. My daughter was crowning then and since I had been in active labour for over 7 hours by this point I was exhausted and couldn't push her out. I was put onto a wheelchair, and pushed down a freezing cold corridor to the delivery ward where I was told I couldn't have a c-section as she was already coming out, however I also couldn't have ant painkillers as I had to focus on pushing my daughter out. By some miracle I managed to push her out, but I don't recall anything after that until the next morning as I had fallen unconscious from the blood loss and my heart had momentarily stopped. 
I had my friend and partner in the room with me and they said that the room went deathly silent after the heart monitor showed I had no pulse and then multiple midwives rushed in and began doing CPR and using defibrillators. Meanwhile another midwife was handling my daughter who had been born with her cord wrapped around her neck and wasn't breathing. 
I'm forever grateful to the midwife who saved my daughter, and the midwives who saved me. 
After being sent home to recover my husband and mum urged me to report the night staff for medical negligence but after months of trying to get justice for what happened to me and my daughter the hospital still didn't take me seriously, blaming the situation on me claiming that I should've been more assertive. 

My family are all aware of this but the frequently blame me saying that it was my fault for having a baby at such a young age anyway, and that I should've had an abortion. My husband and I always wanted to start a family and were delighted when we found out I was pregnant, and we followed the pregnancy through as there was 0 complications, both me and my baby were incredibly healthy. 
Despite them all blaming it on me, they are still pushing me and husband to try for another baby so my daughter has a playmate, not caring about the trauma childbirth has put me through. 

I really don't know what to do anymore, I love my daughter so much but sometimes I just feel miserable, unable to motivate myself to do anything. I'm lucky to have my husband here really as he is a big help but even still we struggle, some days I'm fine and able to go out and do fun things, but most days it feels like I'm just stuck in a void. 
I've tried going to therapy to help but the therapists I've been to were horrible, eventually saying that they couldn't have me as a client as they found me intolerable as it was my fault the entire experience happened to begin with.
I'm running out of ways to cope, and I'm scared of losing my daughter because of this.

Married 8 years. 3 kids.

I have a married friend whose wife cheated on him 1 year into their marriage. He stated he was very supportive during the pregnancy, and she was fine and didn’t say anything during or after the pregnancy. The guy she cheated on him with was an ex-bf. When they were dating, this was the same ex-bf she was going back and forth between him and my friend. He stated that she would be out all night until 3 am with the ex-bf friend during their first year and half of marriage and say it was nothing, they’re just friends. She lied about the cheating when he asked so they went to marriage counseling….and she lied about the cheating in marriage counseling. She finally confessed to the cheating on their fifth year wedding anniversary and blamed it on postpartum depression. He went into a dark place during this time, stated that the cheating broke something inside of him and that he was embarrassed to be cheated on. He kept saying he did everything right and still got cheated on. He wanted to leave after the cheating, but she threatened him and stated that he would never see his daughters again if he left her, so he stayed.

676,"I have a history of depression since high school and anxiety since I was a kid. I've also been diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. I've worked with therapists and med management and was doing ok before I got pregnant. I had a miserable pregnancy, so honestly after like the first week post C-section I felt pretty amazing. Yeah, newborns are hard but compared to how depressed and sick I was during pregnancy I was honestly on a good high. Then my anxiety has been gradually worsening over the last 6 weeks and I reached out to get back on some medication which was helping a bit.

Basically since then I've been struggling so much with increased anxiety and low lows. Even starting to get suicidal ideations which I have struggled with in the past but not in years. Don't worry, no plans on acting on anything - I care about my baby too much and am also aware of the fact this is a mental health issue I need to get treated. I've been drinking too much too which then gives me crippling ""hangxiety"" the next day and messes with the little sleep I am getting. I am well aware I am going down a slippery path. I know I need to start doing things to improve my mental health and life choices. I'm overwhelmed though and struggling getting in to see a therapist after needing to switch from my last one who wasn't great with anything around having a child.

677,"I had the idea to start this diary today as I was taking a walk with my 4-month old daughter. It’s a cold, gloomy day here where I live, and I was yet again feeling the horrible angst of anxiety lingering in the background. How was I going to “get through” this day with nothing on the calendar to keep me distracted?

I’ve lived with anxiety for almost as long as I can remember, and recently started experiencing depression to go with it for the past 3 or 4 years. I always used to wonder what was wrong with me, why I was so broken, and rage about how unfair it was that I was raised with some kind of thought pattern or belief system that kept me in this prison.

At its worst point, I thought about ending my life almost daily. I told myself the world would be so much better off without me as I saw what a drain and toll my depression was taking on my marriage and those around me. I didn’t see any point in continuing to try all the self-help techniques I learned in the thousands of dollars I spent on courses and books. I seriously believed that in a world of “survival of the fittest,” some people just aren’t cut out to handle all the mental and emotional challenges life throws at us, especially when you don’t really know what they are in particular.

To elaborate, I often really had no idea why I was depressed. I was born into an upper middle class family and always had anything I needed or wanted. I make six figures a year, and I have never had to worry about money or where my next rent check was coming from. I’m married to a man who also makes six figures and we’ve always lived in beautiful apartments or townhomes with nice new fixtures and stainless steel appliances. I’ve taken all kinds of vacations and stayed in some beautiful resorts.

Then, my baby girl was born in July of this year. Because I had already struggled with depression before I was pregnant, it’s no surprise that postpartum anxiety and depression hit me like a ton of bricks. Not only was I now struggling to get through each day with the feeling of emptiness I had already been carrying for years, but on top of it all I had a tiny, very needy little human who needed my attention almost 24/7. The hands-down worst part was that she hated (and still hates) the car seat, so even if I did want to try to go somewhere or do something with friends to try to enjoy life and feel some sense of connection, I had to mentally prepare myself for the heartbreak of hearing her scream and cry for the duration of the ride.

But amazingly, after struggling through postpartum for the 16 weeks of my maternity leave at work, I had a beautiful realization while on a walk with her one day as I tried to fight of the anxiety yet again. As terrifying as it was, the truth started speaking to me and I had one of the most beautiful, clean, bright moments of clarity. The reason why I was depressed suddenly seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and all I had to do was admit it to myself.

What I finally had the courage to let myself feel was that I was not at all happy with the life I had spent the last seven and a half years building. I hated my job even though my job title always garnered the admiration of other people. I regretted marrying my husband and getting married at all, and realized I had pushed myself to do what society says and “fight” for my marriage. I hated the townhouse we chose to live in and the area of town we were in, even though it was brand new. And most startling but matter-of-fact of all, I never wanted children. I had just wanted to avoid disappointing others (my husband very much wanted children and my and his parents were dying to be grandparents) and the judgement that is automatically passed on a woman who doesn’t want children (she’s selfish, she just hasn’t met the right man, it’s biological and she’ll “get it” eventually).

Ordinarily, I would have been horrified to admit these things (I had already spent the last 7 years refusing to allow myself to feel them) and been sobbing uncontrollably as I realized that I “got it all wrong.” After all, I was a huge perfectionist and my life was supposed to be perfect, not to mention how hurt other people were going to be if they realized this is really who I am and how I feel.

But recently, I had been reading authors like Markus Rothkranz, Bob Proctor, and Louise Hay, and I realized that the truth is really all we have and all we can rely on. Living our truth the only way we can be really happy, because what’s the alternative? Continuing to pretend and hoping it magically gets better someday? I don’t know if you’ve ever pretended not to be in pain when something is actually physically hurting you, but it’s pretty obvious that you can’t do it forever.

And so, I’ve decided that from now on, I will start being completely truthful with myself and ask myself what I REALLY want. Not what society or my parents or anyone else would be impressed by, or what even I myself “should” be impressed by, like choosing to be married. While I do want a partner who I love more than anything, I’ve realized that committing to them legally through marriage may not be actually what I want, and that’s totally okay. The sad part is I would have normally judged others if they felt that way, which I why I believe I snuffed out that part of me for so long.

My plan is to begin refusing to live parts of my life that are inauthentic to me, starting with my job. Maternity leave was perfect in that it forced me to make a decision between staying at a job I hate and staying home to raise my daughter. I chose the latter, and my last day at my job will be in six weeks. My family is pushing me to look for another remote job to replace that one, but I won’t be. I’m stepping out on faith that the work that I truly love doing will find me, and money will come as a side effect.

I am telling my husband I want to separate in a few weeks’ time. I don’t want anything from him and will let him take anything he wants from the house we share now, and I will be giving the rest away for free to anyone who wants or needs it. I have always wanted to completely start from scratch with my clothes, furniture, and other crap that I have accumulated over the years that doesn’t even make me happy. I am so looking forward to having a blank canvas to start living a minimalist lifestyle and thoughtfully build up my possessions with items I love and bring me joy.

Even though I never really wanted children, I love my daughter with all my heart and soul. I am dedicated to being the best parent I can be for her and being nothing but a support system for her authentic personality to come shining through and for her to express herself in the world in the way that makes her the happiest. I have been reading books like “Unconditional Parenting” and “Parent Effectiveness Training” so that I can be extremely mindful of my unconscious habits and patterns and hopefully break generational curses.

I don’t know what starting all over at 28 will be like, but I can’t wait to find out. I know there are moments where I’ll probably be more depressed than ever and doubtful that blowing up my entire life was the right thing to do, but I’m also choosing to accept that it’s just part of the process. I’ve already told one person about my plans and have asked her to support me when times get tough.

I’ll be sharing my diaries mostly as an outlet and a form of reflection for myself, but I do hope that in the process I can inspire others who may be in a similar situation to realize that they can do this too. It hurts my heart more than anything that so many of us struggle with mental illness today and don’t know why, but that the answer could be so painfully obvious, it’s too scary to even consider. I hope you all will follow me in my journey and wish me luck along the way, and I hope I can be brave enough to show anyone who’s reading this that changing your life is entirely possible.",,"idea start diary today take walk month old daughter cold gloomy day live yet feel horrible angst anxiety linger background go get day nothing calendar keep distract

678,"My wife is 1.5 months post partum and wearing me down with constant abuse even while I try to help. Everyone has told me it is PPD/A/R, but she refuses to see a therapist and constantly wakes me up at night during the half of the night when I'm supposed to sleep and she is feeding the baby such that I'm getting 3 hours of sleep a night on a good night and sometimes less. I do not wake her up while I am supposed to feed/tend LO.

But sleep is not even the half of it. She is sometimes indifferent to me (only speaking to direct me to bring her this or that), but frequently nasty about totally nonsensical issues (e.g. did not wipe the floor with the rag she normally uses) and sometimes actually abusive (throwing things at me). Our whole relationship seems to  have become transactional and/or negative. She shows minor signs of improvement from time to time, but almost always goes back to her bad behavior after a few days. 

Every now and again we joke or flirt, but it's often coming from me and on her end it's few and far between. This says nothing of what she has done with my MIL against me to make me uncomfortable in our own home. I can express no negative emotions (e.g. tiredness) lest I earn myself a round of loud reminders that she is more tired and I shouldn't complain. We can have no serious discussions where I do not immediately agree with her, otherwise she accuses me of manipulating her into yelling/throwing things (I try not to argue, but we still have to make decisions).

I have tried to remind her of how we met and fell in love and all the good times to conjure some good memories for me and for her, but it doesnt really seem to alter her attitude toward me beyond the few minutes when we have these conversations. I try sympathizing with her feelings of being overwhelmed, frustrated etc, but she denies having any such feelings. This is not the woman I married. Read other posts for more details.

Recently, we talked to my mother on video chat about entirely innocuous stuff (health, showing the baby, every day issues). My mother showed more concern, warmth, and love for me in that call than my wife has since our child was born. Afterward, I was noticeably emotional because I felt the loneliness and the hardship of being with my wife redouble in contrast to my mother's warmth and kindness. 

While I was blurry eyed and trying to suppress crying, my wife looked at me with contempt on her face and said ""whatever your problem is, we are not talking about it tonight, I need my sleep."" My heart went cold at that--like I don't need sleep too--and that she could say such a thing when I am obviously hurting. When I did actually discuss it with her the next day, she said ""you're just being manipulative"" and refused to own up to any bad behavior. 

Now here's the catch: because of local rules (not living in NA/Europe) my wife controls most of our money including savings even though I am the primary breadwinner (she's on unpaid maternity leave). I told her, ""I need X amount, please put it on this card so I can pay for therapy this month."" She says: ""it's too much, not this month."" I know she does not like my therapist, because my therapist has encouraged me to draw boundaries with MIL, for instance, and money is also not an issue. When she said this, my heart turned to stone for the second time because therapy is honestly my only lifeline right now.

I told her she needed to give me the money and I reminded her of our previous agreements not to leverage money against each other and that she would give me money I deposited on her account when I needed it. 

I got upset with her when she just kept saying ""no, no, no"", ""I'm not listening"" etc and I reminded her that her ex did the same thing with money to her and she hated it. After that, she simply shut down and refused to discuss it. In the end, when I insisted she transfer my salary from last month back to me, she said that if I persist with asking for money back or money for therapy, she will divorce me. I am so gobsmacked right now and feeling super vulnerable. I happen to know how to get my hands on a small portion of what she has deposited (enough to carry me through the end of the month without therapy), but I think if I take it out, it will be the end and she will actually kick me our of our home/seperate/divorce. 

I feel like I have to take this money for my own well-being and possibly survival, but the thought of it ending my marriage and probably any real access to LO, breaks my heart.

Advice would be welcome, but mostly perspective--I need to know if I sound insane or not. Am I being dramatic here or am I really in as bad a situation as I think I am?",,"wife   month post partum wear constant abuse even try help everyone tell ppdar refuse see therapist constantly wake night half night suppose sleep feed baby get   hour sleep night good night sometimes less wake suppose feedtend lo

I had a terrible experience with Lexapro and would like to know if anyone else has had a similar reaction or can offer some insight.

I was prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro and took my first dose yesterday. I also take Adderall for ADD, but I skipped it yesterday to see how the Lex would affect me. After having breakfast and taking a postnatal vitamin, I took the Lexapro.

Within an hour, I felt somewhat energized. However, after 2-3 hours, I began to feel very strange—dazed, sluggish, with a racing heart and confusion. When my husband came home briefly, he said my pupils were ginormous, which really freaked me out. I told him I felt weird, almost as if I hadn’t slept in days. He thought I was overthinking things and left for work. I was terrified when he left because I didn't want to be home alone with the baby. 

I called my doctor and spoke with a nurse, who suggested my symptoms might be related to the Adderall. I explained that it had been almost 24 hours since my last dose of it (10 mg IR). She then suggested I might be experiencing anxiety and advised me to take it easy but to continue taking the Lexapro. She also told me to call or go to the ER if my symptoms worsened.

I know how drugs feel. I was high, and not in a fun way. It felt similar to a comedown from Molly (MDMA) or a speed bender with no sleep. This unsettling feeling lasted about 4 to 5 hours before improving, but I felt on edge and strung out for the rest of the day. I realize this isn’t typical for SSRIs, but I can’t dismiss what I experienced. It didn’t feel like an anxiety attack; my body was reacting poorly to the medication.

Could this have been mild serotonin syndrome? I’m curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. I want help for my postpartum depression, but I'm terrified to experience this again. ",,"

691,"Hi all, wasn’t exactly sure where to post this so hopefully this is the best place to reach anyone else out there who has experienced this. I’m 4.5 months postpartum and overall doing better but definitely still dealing with my majorly traumatic birth. I have been dealing with terrible PPD/PPA and finally started Lexapro which has been a game changer. Super long post warning-thank you to anyone who actually makes it through the whole thing! 

Got induced at 38 weeks due to my history of high BP and worry of pre-eclampsia and baby measuring large. Started with miso, things actually started moving quite quickly and had a foley bulb placed about 10ish hours later (HORRIBLE pain inserting and the contractions after…OUCH). It also worked, out in 3 hours and 3cm dilated. Started me on pitocin nice and slow. Finally, started working. I guess I should also say that I have a history of cervical cancer and have been through the wringer with OB stuff and majorly trusted my OB and really wanted her to be the one to deliver my daughter. She actually picked up a shift just so she could be there. So…she gets on shift at 7pm. Comes and checks me, 5cm dilated and baby was only at a -2 station but she broke my water anyway. I had mild polyhydraminos (extra amniotic fluid) so it was like a geyser. My contractions were IMMEDIATELY horrible. I then asked for the epidural. Got up and went to the bathroom and while in there heard the anesthesiologist come in so I came back out and my doctor was already back in and said she wanted to check baby. Ended up telling me I’m getting a VERY emergency c-section and ended up calling a code blue in the hospital bc baby’s cord had come out with all my fluid. I got put on my hands and knees with a nurse’s hand up me holding baby’s head off of the cord. I’m pretty sure every nurse in that hospital was in there and they raced me to the OR. On my way getting rushed down the hall, someone asked the nurse for a pulse check and she said she didn’t have a pulse, it scared the living shit out of me but apparently she just meant she wasn’t checking the cord for one since she was holding baby’s head. Better communication would have been nice. Since I didn’t have an epidural yet, they had to put me under general anesthesia so I missed everything � my parents and my in-laws got to meet my daughter before me. I don’t even remember meeting her because apparently they gave me a medication to hopefully help me forget some of the trauma but I remember every single second and only don’t remember waking up and meeting my daughter. From the time the prolapse was discovered to the time she was out was 9 minutes. It was insane and the most traumatic thing I’ve truly ever been through. I am SO grateful and thankful and all the things that my sweet girl is here and healthy with no lasting effects and that I made it through ok as well. But man, if I’m not still struggling to work through that and the loss of those firsts that I will never, ever get since she is our only baby. I still cry myself to sleep sometimes replaying it all. I just wish we would have talked and gotten me the epidural before breaking my water. Or just kept waiting to see how my body continued to react to the pitocin. I think the hardest thing for me is I went in with basically NO agenda/plan except for some hopes of delayed cord clamping, no wiping off of the vernix, immediate skin to skin, that kind of thing (which I got none of, of course �). I legit told my doctor the week before when discussing options that my ONLY fear was an induction that ended in emergency c-section under general anesthesia. She told me “that only happens every 2-3 years and is super unlikely”. I was ok with a vaginal birth, c-section, medication, whatever. Just NOT general anesthesia because I knew what that would mean. My heart is just totally broken over it all.

Some information: 
I’m a stay at home mom, my husband works.

On his night shifts, I stay at my parents because I’m too afraid to stay home alone. 

He recently took some time off, which meant I had him home for a while. He just went back to work and I’ve been having such a difficult time staying home - and the “root” of the problem is being afraid to spend wake windows with my baby.

I grew up with a deeply disturbed, narcissistic mother and an enabling father, with whom I finally went no contact with last year. All my life I wanted to be a mom and give my family a better life that my siblings and I had. I’ve spent years in therapy getting professional help and finding medication, and am in a very happy, healthy marriage.

Now that I am a mom, though, I’m absolutely miserable. I want nothing to do with my son or motherhood in general. I stay home while my husband works and every day when I hear the front door close after he leaves I burst into tears because I don’t know how I’m going to do another 10 hours alone with him. My MIL is great and helps with him a ton, however even after a full day without him I dread picking him up. 

I had a really hard time bonding with him for the first few months and it got better for a bit, but now it’s like he’s not even my own baby. I feel responsible for taking care of him but I look at it like a chore. I absolutely despise myself for feeling this way - I have a happy, healthy, and sweet baby, which a lot of people would do anything to have. I feel broken. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me or why I am this way. He is just a baby and hasn’t done anything and doesn’t deserve a mother who doesn’t want to be around him. I cry constantly because of the guilt. My husband comes home and is completely obsessed with him and it makes me feel so ashamed of myself. 

I am the first of my friends to have a baby and he wasn’t planned. My therapist says the way I feel is normal for a new mom but I just can’t imagine any other mothers wanting nothing to do with their child the way I do. I’m so terrified of accidentally becoming my own mother, who was self-centered and unaffectionate - but it’s like something inside of me is incapable of motherhood. I don’t know what to do. 

I had bad postpartum and my PMDD returned after giving birth, both of which I have found great relief from in hormone therapy in the last few months, but I’m not hormonal I’m just miserable.

This will help me complete the assignment obviously, but it will also help me refine what I want my non-profit u/postchoicefoundation to offer.I know I'm a doula, I promise I'm not going to pitch services to you.

6. What are your emotions, what moves you, what motivates you? What keeps you up at night?

7. What do you actually say and do? What are you telling others? What do you say vs. what do you do and what do you think?

8. What do you really need? what are your biggest frustrations? what prevents you from seeking help, or achieving your goals? what fears are present when thinking about the risks associated with achieving these goals and getting what you really need or want?

The world spins on. Well meaning people ask about more children and comment on the way my body looks.

That depression, anxiety and anger would color my first year with my child. The holidays would feel scary and again worries that I was being selfish oscillating with feelings of anger that people were unaware of my experience. That returning to work at the hospital would turn into heart wrenching trigger that I should feel grateful that my daughter is healthy. The sadness felt unjustified. The shoulds swirled in my brain. This is nothing like I expected. Like so many families, we needed my salary and health benefits. Just keep going. Push it down, with time the memories will fade. Memories would pop up “Am I going to die?” The look of panic on my care teams faces. But you are fine, your daughter is healthy… keep moving forward. Be gracious, be thankful, be appreciative.

Don’t make too much of a fuss, just keep going. Did you write your thank you notes? You don’t want to be an attention seeker, deal with this in therapy. Keep it to yourself! Be polite and gracious, they are well meaning. What’s the most polite way to grieve? It’s been a year, it’s time to move forward.

722,"Hey.

I’m 29 years old and have four small children (ages 7, 4, 2, and 5 months). I had pretty easy recoveries with my first three babies, but since having my youngest son, I have been in a mental health crisis.

For me, it started within a month of my son being born but I didn’t realize what was happening until a few months postpartum, and I delayed reaching out for help.

My PPD/PPA is marked my extreme sadness and anxiousness, feelings of worthlessness, guilt, panic attacks that sometimes last for hours, difficulty eating, intrusive (sometimes suicidal) thoughts, and hopelessness.

The depression and anxiety has been exacerbated by several life stressors. My husband has been battling cancer for two years, and he was recently diagnosed with a second (unrelated) cancer. Also, our son was born with a heart defect and stayed in NICU for 9 days and at my 6 week postpartum checkup, I found out I was in the “precancerous stages” of cervical cancer.

These have been the darkest days of my life. I’ve lost 20lbs in two months. I’m blessed to have a strong support system from my husband, parents and older sister. I’m currently meeting with a therapist weekly and taking medication (Lexapro) to aid in my recovery.

I thought I would be better by now. It feels like the mental anguish is stretching on without end. Between the feelings of hopelessness, the panic attacks, and the intrusive thoughts, most days it feels like I’m all alone and things won’t ever get better.

I’m thankful I found this forum.

Thank you for taking the time to hear a little of my story. I hope to make connections with other women who have made it through to the other side. �",,"hey

A little backstory, I’ve been breastfeeding for 7 months (we combo feed with formula, but it’s usually mostly breastmilk) and I got my period back a few months ago. It was unexpected, but fairly normal for the first couple cycles. This cycle however, has been a complete nightmare. I’ve always been very sensitive to hormone changes and have struggled with PMS, to the point where I believe it could be PMDD but my doctor refused to diagnose me because I did not have any suicidal thoughts/ideations.

728,"I’m getting more angry by the moment. Yesterday, I went to my counseling session and on the way home almost ran over my 6yo boy. He rode his sled down the driveway and into the bushes at the end. I was worried about if my van would make it up the driveway and was contemplating how much I should accelerate or just ease up into the driveway. I was so mad and scared he had done this. I had specifically told ALL the kids no sleds and no shovels (they leave the snow shovels out in the yard and lose them when it snows). 
My daughters 15, and 13 were supposed to be watching the kids. The 15 said she had checked on the boys outside every few minutes and didn’t realize he had gotten the sled. I believe her but I was so shaken and sad yesterday and last night.  
I’m going to counseling to feel better, not to come home and almost run over my own kid. 

So this morning I want to go to the gym and I am scared to leave the kids at the house. I can take 2 small ones to the gym daycare and then at 11 is parent teacher conferences. My husband is working out of town. So he wasn’t here last night to help with kids and he is not here this morning. I texted him and told him I was scared to leave the house with the girls watching the kids. He thought it would be ok if I just took the baby and the 6yo to the gym. But what about the other kids? So I suggested maybe I should stay home and do a home workout instead. The intensity won’t be the same and the kids will interrupt me and pester me while I’m working out. I’m doing a 6 wk workout challenge so I have to work out.  
It’s not fair I am left at home to figure this out. This always happens to the SAHM. If I was a man I would have a wife and I could just leave when I wanted and go have my workout and not be bothered to worry about the kids. 

Yesterday, we had a long conversation before he left. He asked me if I want to leave or divorce him bc I keep telling him that he deserves someone better than me. I just want to disappear. He asked me what would make me happy. I told him I would like to somehow quietly extricate myself from him and the kids. They don’t need me and he just needs someone different than me. 
I honestly can’t think of anything good about myself. I feel like I am worse this week than I was last week.

I have moments where real people don't 'feel real' to me anymore, typically people who have hurt me. I'm starting to feel like that with my baby daddy. I was thinking of him not too long ago, and suddenly every memory I have of him feels more like a dream. Like it never actually happened. I can barely remember what he looks like in person. I can't remember any other sense, like touch, smell, etc (I used to be able to). I'm not quite sure how to explain it further than that.

I have experienced this with small things here and there, too. Like I'll text someone, then forget I did, then think about it later in the day except I'm not sure if I actually texted them or if I dreamt that I did. I'd say about half the time it was a dream, half the time reality.

At first I wasn't too worried, because I just figured it was a side effect and the immense stress I'm in and sleep deprivation. But feeling like my baby daddy is not real is putting me through even more stress. I'm not sure if this would be considered derealization, or something else.

My marriage feels like it’s sinking. I’m 2 months post partum today. I have 4 daughters, ages 5, 3, 2, and the 2 month old. I have had postpartum depression with all of my pregnancies, including my first pregnancy where I had a stillbirth at 38 weeks. I have noticed symptoms I dealt with previously making an appearance again. I feel like when my house is a mess I can’t breathe. I feel like I can’t do anything without my newborn. I really wanted to be able to breastfeed this time. With my first, I could never get her to latch and didn’t have any idea how to pump at the time. With my second, I breastfed her and bottle fed her breastmilk until 8 months when my supply disappeared because I was pregnant with our third. With my third, I don’t even know how long I tried breastfeeding her before I gave up for my mental health. She was my only delivery without an epidural, and unfortunately I think because it was so traumatic for me, I didn’t bond with her as much and that affected my breastfeeding journey with her. My newest has been difficult to even try to get her to take a bottle with breastmilk in it. She only wants boob. She won’t take a pacifier. I’m not against formula at all, but it breaks my heart to even think about stopping. But I also feel relief when I think about stopping. I feel worthless. My husband has always treated me wonderfully. He’s always there for me when I need him. But I know I’ve been nasty to him lately, but I feel like it’s not me talking. I feel like my family would be better off without me. I don’t want to take antidepressants because I dont believe in medications. I know there’s people who believe that’s the only way to get through things, but I know there has to be another option for me? I feel like I’m single handedly tearing my family apart.

742,"I'll be 3 months postpartum on 11/3. This is our 3rd baby after a long hiatus, our other 2 are 9 and 7, so it's been a while since battling these feelings. We also live on our own in another state with very disconnected families, so there is no help outside of my husband coming home from work.
I don't know why, but since having our daughter, I immediately jump to thoughts  of divorce when I start feeling alone and down and I don't know what to do to stop it. I'm waiting on my next therapy appointment but I always feel gaslit when talking about postpartum depression symptoms.

I work a full time job from home and I have the baby with me, we don't have a sitter or daycare. I feel like I'm working 2 jobs when he's gone, then my older kids come home from school and I juggle all of the kids and dogs and cat and try figuring out food, homework, cleaning, etc. It's a lot.
When he comes home I try passing the baby to him as she's like velcro to me, I can't put her down unless she's napping, and I end up with her repeatedly for the rest of the evening, even when I'm not breastfeeding.

749,"This last week has been tough. I switched meds and they had some serious side effects: suicide ideation. I made a list of my belongings and what should be done with them upon my passing. I haven’t told my husband this but we did have a talk about going to an emergency room if I felt I needed it. That the kids would be ok at the house and we would sort things out. 
On Tuesday The kids ate a whole box of Nilla Wafers I bought for them on Sunday. I was so mad so I”quit” being a mom. I told them I am not cooking or cleaning or parenting any of them for a while. I have older girls so they have been taking care of things. My husband is out of town. He is working through his own hardships and is trying to get us more financially stable. 

He sent me a reel last night about a lady who said she was trying to do everything ie feminism and live up to the hype of social media. She said she “thinks” men want a nurturing partner to produce offspring and create a peaceful home.  
So I asked him why he married me and he can’t give me an answer that isn’t tied to me being a mother. I kept asking and he said it was because I was kind and loving and wanted to improve myself as a person. He also commented on my looks quoting the Song of Solomon.  
So I told him that I guess I am looking for a specific answer that he can’t give me. Other than I’m “nice and kind”. That just affirmations to me that I am not “special” or “unique” in any way. He could meet up with any number of women and determine they are nice and kind and want to improve themselves. His answer just affirms to me that I am replaceable and he can find happiness with someone else who is not me. Someone who is smarter, prettier, funny, and better at everything else. 

Tell me I am not wrong for wanting a better answer than just he likes me for “being giving and helping other people”. 
What kind of an answer is that? I know I’m not the prettiest and my body isn’t what it used to be. I have lots of grey hair that has appeared within the last year. My face is tired and saggy.

753,"My Dad recently made a ""joke"" that has been hurting me ever since. 

For context, I'm 19 and I had moved out at 18 with my boyfriend at the time (now ex). We both had stable incomes. After I got pregnant, I lost my job and a couple months later he lost his. After we found out I was pregnant, the relationship got very toxic. I don't want to go too into detail, because it's not relevant to what my dad said, but to put it simply, we lost our apartment and broke up and now I live with my parents again. My baby is currently 4 months, and my ex doesn't do really anything at all to help provide. My brother helped me out a lot with watching my baby for the first couple of months, especially since I had a csection. I appreciate all the help, but one thing I struggle with is feeling disconnected from my baby and not feeling like a mother. I was insecure about my ability to parent and thought that my baby didn't recognize me and would think that my mom is his. My brother would also make jokes whenever my baby would cry whenever I'd hold him and say that my son didn't like me.

My Dad told me a couple weeks ago that my brother spends so much time with him that my son thinks he's his mommy. Then he made a joke that my son is secretly calling him mommy behind my back. Idk if this sounds like not a big deal, but that hurt me a lot, especially with everything I was already thinking about myself. It still hurts me now and makes it hard for me to ask for help even though I know I need it. I feel ashamed for the situation I'm in and feel like a terrible mother.

Sometimes I regret having a baby. And it hurts so much to write out because I'm holding my baby right now. I love him so much, I really do. But I'm tired of everything I'm going through and people making me feel worse for it. I hate that my ex can live freely and I can't. I feel like I'm a horrible mom and my baby deserves more. I'm tired of crying in front of my baby but having to smile through it bc I don't want him to see how sad I really am.

I just got used to it I guess, preparing myself everyday to a battle (that I guess will never end). 

So during my 6 weeks postpartum check-up, I was referred to behavioral health which I still haven’t process until now, they diagnosed me with PPD plus PP mood disturbance, I just told them the guilt that I felt when my milk supply got lost and I can’t do anything about it but honestly it is more beyond that, like I really can’t cope up with this role, I feel like Im failing, I feel like shit. Everytime my LO cries I just really want to scream and sometimes I really do scream at him and that scares me and feeling terrible and guilty after. I mean I really do love him but this is so hard.
I never had thoughts of harming my baby but many times to myself, I usually tell my baby and myself that “Lord please just let me die if this will be my life every single day night.” And sometimes I do feel like I just really want to hang myself, it’s just so overwhelming like I don’t know what I’m doing wrong each time my baby cries and I do feel jealous with mothers who have easy babies.

758,"So to start with some context, I have recently diagnosed audhd and I have had depression and anxiety from a very young age. I've gotten that under control with the right medications and therapy, but not without a handful of bumps along the way. I am so lucky to be married to my best friend and to be starting a family with him. He is kind and patient and funny and just the best I could've ever asked for.

I have had some turmoil with my in-laws within the last 5 years or so that began when we overheard my (now) husband's mother scream crying that she didn't want him to marry me a few months into our engagement. (Now I know I'm not nearly as wonderful as my husband; I am tarnished with childhood trauma and I'm working hard to prevent spreading any of it to my son.) But she was a big part of my childhood (my husband and I were neighbors and good friends growing up), and I looked to her for wisdom and advice and she was a real inspiration to me. When she let out her true feelings that she didn't like me, my world shattered and I instantly threw up invisible barriers to protect myself. So we act totally fine and catch up like all is well when we see eachother, but I can only handle seeing the in-laws maybe 2 times a month. By the end of each get together I am drained of all emotional energy. They are inherently good people, but they are in their own little bubble they've established, with very few friends or family involved in their lives. It's hard to be one of the few people they have around, especially since my husbands brother moved across country last year. It feels like they're more reliant on us to fill that gap wince they're empty nesters now. When we slowly started to come over less, they seemed mostly fine with that, and the relationship with them felt much less rocky.

I just gave birth to our beautiful boy last week and I have never been more happy in my life. Truly, I have never loved my husband more than when I see him being a daddy. I have never felt more purpose and contentment with my life. 

However, the second our baby was born, my MIL has swept in to try to be with us as often as she can. It is my biggest pet peeve when someone tiptoes around their real intentions as if I'm dumb or complacent. My MIL is insisting on coming by everyday to drop off something to ""help"" us with. That sounds like the right thing that people should do for new parents, sure, and I'd love it if she'd been this way the last 5 years. But she has shown time and time again that she doesn't like me for her son and thus, this ""help"" feels transactional and wrong. I'd even let that go if she hadn't already blatantly disrespected us and our boundaries with the baby.

It's often debated what boundaries parents set, and if they're reasonable or not. I made it clear throughout this pregnancy 1:do not kiss the baby by any means and dont put your hands on his face 2:do not invite yourself or others over.

My in-laws kissed my son at least 30 times and when confronted said ""oh we agree babies shouldn't be kissed on the face, but we just did the top of his head"". Then I was told she invited aunts and other people to come see ""her baby"".
Now I respect that she's his grandmother and she has every right to be excited and to love him. 
I've been emotional as hell since this boy was born and it is almost all joy. But then the stress of having to set boundaries with this difficult person that I can never fully cut off has put me into a spiral. Every time she messages I feel my chest swell with anxiety and anger and I end up sobbing uncontrollably and screaming like a banshee at how mad I am at her. I then cry from how guilty I feel for being so upset when this should be the happiest time of my life. My husband has been the perfect dad and spouse and I've been making things so difficult but I can't control my emotions. My baby's eyes and my husband's hugs bring me back to earth but having a newborn is already hard on a relationship. I don't want to also have to be the bad guy with my MIL because ultimately, while I'd rather not have her in my life, she is my love's mother and I do respect that bond.

I am sleep deprived and my body doesn't feel like my own. I don't feel like myself and I miss who I was pre-pregnancy. But I'm also so in love with being a mom. It's an absolute Rollercoaster. I'm joining a post-partum program soon, but I'm afraid a great deal of healing will only be able to be done if I confront my trauma and issues with my MIL. I'm going to offend her and probably mess things up for a little while but for my own sanity I think these feelings need to be addressed with the source.

That was a lot but I needed to sort out my thoughts and vent. I already feel a little better now, whether or not anyone responds to this.

Thoughts? I'm not opposed to hearing that I'm a pos daughter-in-law because I have considered that theory as well.

Ever since having my baby I feel like I no longer matter. Aside from my husband and maybe two of my friends, all communication is about the baby. My mom isn’t around, my dad uses my child as a social media prop- coming over for 15 minutes a week to hold/take photos and leave. My in-laws are the “come over if you need us” kind of people, and my mother in law is 12 hours away. She would help if she could, but distance makes that understandably difficult. 
I had a pretty traumatic birth, and my baby and I both had complications from it. He was in the NICU for almost a week and I was in a specialty care unit for a few days. My husband had only a week of paternity leave, and it was all spent while we were hospitalized. I’m alone all day in the house tending to my newborn without any support. I feel like my own basic needs (bathing, eating) are falling to the wayside because of this lack of support. I’m scared to welcome people into my home because the housekeeping and self care have been so lax and I don’t want to be judged for it. My husband helps as much as he can after work and at night, but I dread the days because I feel like I’m constantly in survival mode. 

I just have to believe that it gets better.

763,"Sorry if it’s a bit confusing on the way I write but it’s my first time.

Hi everyone, I’m a mom in my 20s with a 5-month-old baby. I’m currently a stay-at-home mom (SAHM), and while I absolutely love my baby and would never do anything to hurt them, I’m feeling overwhelmed, lost, and constantly crying myself to sleep. Lately, I’ve been battling suicidal thoughts, but I need to clarify: I would never harm my baby—it’s just that this new life is starting to crush me emotionally.

Financially, I feel like I’m drowning. We’ve always been careful with our money, but now my husband checks our budget every week. It used to be once a month, but lately, it’s gotten so much more frequent, and I feel like I’m being micromanaged. I know saving is important, but it’s getting harder to breathe under the constant pressure. I miss having financial freedom, and I’m beginning to resent being a SAHM. I want to work, to feel like I can make my own money and decisions again but I guess this comes down to getting married where it’s no longer “ My” but “ Our money”.

One of the reasons we haven’t opted for child care is that it doesn’t sit well with us. There have been constant news/stories about daycare centers overdosing kids with patches or drugs to calm them down, and we’re not keen on the idea of someone else teaching or influencing our child about things we don’t want them to be part off . It’s just unsettling.

I probably know why I’m feeling this way but this is a background story. Growing up, I had a very different lifestyle. My mom was a widow and worked hard to provide for us to the point her business boomed, she also hired help—nannies,stay at home helpers —to manage things. I never had to do much in terms of chores, and I always had people taking care of me when I was young . I know that sounds privileged, and it is, but that’s the life I grew up with( my grandparents are against the idea of having people around to do houseworks and stuff coz they think it’s gonna make us lazy.
). 
When I finished my degree in pharmacy (which was more of my mom’s dream than mine), I decided I wanted to live my own life and I was encouraged by my uncle (It’s probably a way for him to make me independent). I told my mom I was moving to a different country, and I asked for her help with just the processing part like plane ticket and atleast $2k pocket money and that’s it—I wanted to do the rest on my own. It worked. I didn’t want to rely on her money, and I managed to build my life from there.I’m a nurse now and manage to pay all my bills by working 2 or 3 jobs while I was studying.

Fast forward to now, and it feels like I’ve gone from being independent to completely dependent again. My husband sometimes jokes that I should manage to take care of our baby because my mom raised four kids, but I have to remind him that my mom had help. And now I’m pressured that he’s talking about a second child,him and almost all the people around me.
He does his share of housework because I told him from the beginning that I wouldn’t be doing it all alone unless we were rich enough to hire help. But lately, I’m feeling resentful. He listens to podcasts and videos about parenting, but I wish he would focus more on searching how to physically help with the baby. He works from home three days a week, I just want him to step up and I don’t want to be a nag or doesn’t want him to feel that I’m ordering him around . He doesn’t have initiatives. Instead, I have to ask him to do it, or remind him when it’s time for a bath.He constantly forgets about it and I feel like he doesn’t even know his own child’s routine. We talked about it and he started taking our baby out of our room with him every morning coz our baby wakes up early so he got time to play with her while I continue to sleep. 

I get that he might be under pressure, too, but if he expects me to stay at home for the next five years or more( which he expects me to be and do home schooling), he needs to level up financially. I’m not willing to live a life where we constantly struggle. His mom can’t help on weekdays, and my family isn’t in the country, so I’m feeling even more isolated.

I never thought being a SAHM would feel this suffocating or financially restricting. I love my baby, but I’m not loving this life, and I feel guilty about that. Has anyone else been through this? How did you cope with these feelings or find a way to gain more control over your life? Any advice would mean the world to me.

Thanks for reading.

764,"I am almost certain wife has PPA/PPR but she refuses to look into it or even read the descriptions of it I send her. It is our first LO. She insists she is the same person she was before, but she isn't. She's cold, cruel or indifferent to me (though she's slightly improved on this--from 100% cruel in all situations to being cruel only once a day but otherwise mostly indifferent--she did this, though, only after I gave her a mandate and deadline to stop screaming at me for leaving the microwave door ajar). I want to forgive her, but she gaslights me when I mention that her behavior is wrong and I can see in her body language that she still feels rage to me. (This from a woman who told me women use period pain as an excuse for their character flaws / bad behavior). 

I try to be positive and help her recover. Her mom babysat for an hour with pumped milk and we went to have a meal at her favorite cafe. 75% of the time she was on her phone looking for items for the baby. She buys countless things that even the doctors have told us we do not need (e.g. a billerubin test device even though baby is now at almost normal levels and the doctors say it will resolve in a day or two). In the first few days, she cost us thousands of dollars by running overdrafts without moving some money from savings and I can only alleviate this by hourly checking that she hasn't spent another $500 on something and overdrafted (I mentioned it to her and she says it's my responsibility but i cant press because she cant take it right now) meanwhile I am the real villain for forgetting to take out the trash. 

I'm up with the baby at night with her to burp baby, but she refuses to bottle feed so neither of us get significant sleep. (I also cook breakfast and clean and do diaper duty). She refuses to acknowledge the liberties her mom takes in our home (while MIL is also helping) and screams at me if I try to set healthy boundaries for MIL--such as not barging in unannounced while I am naked.

Ladies: what did your husband do to help pull you out of this cycle? I sat her down to watch her favorite comedy TV show yesterday while the baby was feeding and she couldn't even recall what the 20 minute episode was about because the whole time she was reading something about the best soaps to buy for baby (we already have 5+ designer soaps for babies and the doctor said there's nothing wrong with her skin and to keep using what we're using but just to wash with soap once or at most twice a week).

I'm thinking we can have a five minute dance off or something, but I've got to pull her up and out of this because she is destroying herself and our relationship too and I can't take this too much longer. I read somewhere that mental illness explains behavior, but it doesn't excuse it and there are / should be consequences. 

My latest idea is to try to get her to dance for 5 minutes...silly but I'm trying everything.

But now I’m struggling deeply with ppd. Before getting pregnant I struggled with my mental health… I always have since I was a teenager. I’ve been hospitalized a few times and medicated on and off for years. I have shared with my boyfriend that im struggling a lot right now and he seems like he understands but then responds with “well, this was your dream to have a baby… so find a way to be happy” I continuously tell him that I’m allowed to struggle even though I wanted our child. Sometimes he seems understanding and then other days he seems mad at me for being so sad. He often tries to tell me that he’s having an equally hard time. But after carrying our child for 41 weeks and 3 days in my body having a 30+ hour labor and then going into septic shock from an infection from the delivery with coming to terms that I’m 25 and my body looks awful and my hair is falling out with a baby screaming 24/7…. Oh and not to mention exclusively breast pumping… I feel like things might be a little bit harder for me

I’m starting to resent him and feel like I made a mistake having a child with him.

770,"Hey guys. I’m new here, just had my baby girl 7 days ago. I wanted to just post here to get some feedback/ advice? (I do have an appointment booked with my therapist for next week also) 

So to start off, I had a pretty traumatic birthing experience. Long story short, I labored for 30+ hrs in the hospital, had some complications come up, and then ended up having an emergency c section. (Also relevant: I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past) 

Labor started Monday and I had her Wednesday. Then I had to kick into mom mode and figure out having a newborn and adapt to her while also now trying to recover from having a major abdominal surgery. (Very thankful for my husband because he was there the whole time, was the one that advocated for us and ended up saving our daughter’s life). 

Anyways, all that to say: my brain never had time to catch up and realize or comprehend what just happened. It’s now the following Tuesday and I’ve been having extremely intrusive thoughts (never to hurt my baby) but of ways that my baby COULD be hurt. To the point where I feel like leaving my bed is a danger. Now I try to move past these thoughts because I obviously can’t keep us in bed all day and I do get up and around but my problem is, once I slow down, they come back. And my anxiety is through the roof. Not only with the intrusive thoughts, just life in general. I have horrible anxiety when my husband goes to work (just feeling him gone hurts for some reason). In addition to the normal emotional roller coaster of crying because I love him and her so much. 

I keep myself busy to the point of constantly moving to do something. Doing laundry every day, pumping every couple of hrs, cleaning my breast pump tools, cleaning her bottles, feeding her, changing her, doing and catching up on my assignments (I’m also in school full time for masters), etc. So when I sit down (mainly at night when my hubby is sleeping and my brain won’t shut off, I panic and overthink and cry and worry and everything else under the sun. I dread night time coming because I know what is about to happen. Every day so far. It’s like I’m trying to stay busy to run from my mind. 

I don’t know where the question is here to be honest. And I’m sorry this ended up so long. I just guess I needed to type that out. Is this normal? Is it just postpartum? Or could this be leading down the road of PPD/ PPA? Thanks for reading �",,"hey guy new baby girl   day ago want post get feedback advice appointment book therapist next week also

My wife had an unexpected C-section as our lovely daughter decided she wanted to come 2 weeks early. Thankfully she was born healthy and beautiful! The reason for the semi emergency c-section was that my wife started to have preclampsia. This was an obsticale in its self. 

That day she told me she was going to go home because her BP was high, I told her to meet me at the ER as it was high enough to warrant an ER visit. She would not listen to me though and insisted on going to her OBGYN instead, I tried to tell her to just to to the ER but no luck, obvi the OBGYN was like why are you here and go to the ER. So long story short the Inducing and c-section was not planned (and have come to find out it is a risk factor for developing PPD, along with a few other risk factors I have now found in my own research.) 

So the PPD/A.. 
The days before the birth my wife had a few red flags that in retrospect I should have seen. She mentioned things like she ""wished she never got pregnant"", and that ""our lives would be much better if she didn't get pregnant"", etc. I brushed these off as normal things to be scared of because I mean you know... First Time Parents lol. 

After the birth while in the hospital she was trying to not have the baby come to the room as much as possible. I could understand this to get our rest as the first two days we were both exhausted, as this was all unexpected. She did not have anything packed for the hospital stay, I on the other hand had everything packed ready to go for me and the baby thankfully. On the third day in the hospital I told her we should have the baby overnight so we can get used to feeding the baby at night and if we have any questions we are in the hospital and can ask them. She was very hesitant about this, but I insisted for my own comfort too as I too am a first time parent. This should have been another sign to me though as everything was going okay otherwise, but she just did not want to spend time with the baby.


After getting home, everything was fairly smooth sailing for the first couple days, she seemed depressed and down but I just took that as the ""Baby Blues"" and the extreme fluctuations in hormones. After about 2 weeks though things began to progressively get worse. I noticed at night she would become extremely anxious and flustered and just looking around the room like she didn't know what was going on. At her 2 week OBGYN visit the Dr. Said that she only had the ""Baby Blues"" and it was okay and normal. A few days after this I told her to have the OBGYN call me. (I didn't have her personal number) I spoke with the OBGYN and let her know that things were not getting better and that they were in fact getting worse. The OBGYN then prescribed her some Lexapro. She started taking it for two days before the below event. The OBGYN also suggested a few psychiatrists and a hospital to go to in case of an emergency. 

This all culminated to an event Saturday night at midnight. She was trying to breastfeed the and she was looking extremely flustered and anxious. I noticed that she was making a fist with her hand (although I am sure she was not going to hit the baby) but she made a fist still in her anxiousness. I gently took the baby from her and said that I would feed her. (At this point we were doing both breast feeding as well as bottle feeding with the breast milk so she would have time to rest and not focus on trying to feed every 2 hours.) After I took the baby from her to feed her she broke down and started yelling at me ""the baby's going to die, the baby's going to die, the baby's not going to be able to eat, the baby's going to die."" 

At this point I called her family because I did not know who else to call at midnight to help in this  situation. There is a language barrier between myself and her parents, specifically her mother, as they speak Spanish and I'm only learning right now and I do not know enough to explain this situation effectively. (It is something that I am working on though.) So her aunt and her parents came to the house and spoke with her as I fed and took care of the baby. Her family and I decided during this time that it would be best for her to stay the night with her parents away from the baby crying etc, and I would stay with the baby to take care of her for the night alone and she could get rest. We would re-evaluate the next day. 

On Sunday we decided that it was best to take her to the psychiatric hospital to be evaluated to see if there is any thing that can be done to help her. Well... they decided to keep her for the week. (FML) This devastated me, as I felt that I let her down by taking her there and having her be admitted there for a whole week. I spent nights crying that week while she was in the hospital hoping and wondering if I did the right thing. She has said multiple times that they did nothing for her. She felt that it was ""a summer camp that she was not able to leave from"". I struggle with this still and question if I did the right thing by taking her there. She did show signs of self harm (not necessarily suicidal), however there were signs.

During the time she was in the hospital I took care of the baby at night/rest of weekend. Thankfully her parents were able to help during the day during working hours so I could work from home and be able to provide for us, as I no longer had any sick time or vacation time left to use, as it was used all for the birth of my daughter. 

After my wife was released a week later I felt happy that she was home however, I feel that things are still not good and that I am drowning in my own feelings of trying to be supportive for her as well as trying to be the main caregiver of my daughter, as my wife is not able to help effectively. She has helped a few times in feeding/changing, however she is very much not wanting to be around the baby nor wanting to hold the baby or anything like that at this time. I do all the cooking (always have) and I try and take on all the house work I can, but only so much time in the day lol. 

It has become extremely difficult as I feel like I am taking care of not only my newborn daughter alone, but also trying to take care of another person that is not able take care of themselves and is adding extra stress and mental loads. 

Today was my first day back at work in the office. (boss doesn't like WFH smh) My wife is at her parents house with the baby as she is not allowed to be alone with her. I asked my wife if she could send me a picture of her and the baby, so I can see them and that way she can feel that I am being part of her day still even from a distance. She sent me a picture of her, and then a separate picture of the baby in the bassinet. The baby was laying on a folded up sheet with a blanket over the top of her chest and legs, and the pacifier handing from the leash above her. I immediately wrote back saying that it's NOT okay and that the baby needs to be in the bassinet with just themselves and no loose blankets, nothing underneath her, etc. for safe sleeping practices and reducing the risk of SIDS. This is something that her mother did, and has done a few times. I have tried to iterate that this is not okay to do and things have changed in the last 40 years. This is where the language barrier hinders as well as she is not my mother but my MIL. I told my wife I need to be able to trust her when she is at her parents to make sure they are doing things safely. Thankfully she sent me a video afterwards showing the baby in the bassinet safely sleeping. 

I am struggling to try and be that supportive person/rock, as well as working, and trying to trust that her family going to do the correct practices to make sure that my daughter will be safe. I know they're not doing it out of ill will, but just out of being uninformed. 

This is all really straining me mentally
as I need to be hyper vigilant that she is not left alone with the baby, judge her mood and her anxiety levels so as to know if she is okay to be around the baby, making sure my daughter makes it to her pediatrician appointments, working to pay bills, and making sure she's fed/changed when not at her parents during the day. I have no problem taking care of my daughter, I enjoy it in fact (which I never thought would have been something that suited me well.) I have thought many times that this would be easier if it was just me doing this alone. 

Thankfully I go to therapy for myself, (which I started before the birth of my daughter for separate reasons)

Each day I do feel I see a glimmer of hope, but I don't know if that's just me being optimistic as every day is still very much a challenge. Hopefully the medication begins to work and in time things improve.

This is just something that I need to come to terms with and to try and be the best partner/father that I can be.

Lately, I find myself repeating in my head, “This is my son; I am his mom,” but sometimes it feels like I’m taking care of someone else’s baby. That thought breaks my heart. I go through phases where I either feel overwhelmed, constantly researching and trying to perfect my parenting, or I feel completely numb.

I try to engage with him and support his development, but I find myself becoming apathetic. Some days, I’d rather just put him in front of the TV and stare at the wall.


I’m embarrassed to admit that I’ve lied on the pediatrician’s questionnaires about PPD. I always rushed through them to avoid raising any flags, but now I don’t know how to approach my doctor. All I want is to be a better mom for my baby.

773,"Hi all,
I have a 6 weeks old baby.
For the first 5 weeks I was so happy and so attached to my baby, I was so proud of myself of how well I was doing it. Since the last few days, I’ve been feeling very anxious and the intrusive thoughts have come back again. I am constantly having the intrusive thoughts of harming my baby, doubting myself if I really love him, etc and it is torturing me, even to a point that I even feel dizzy of the high level of anxiety I am feeling.
I’ve been suffering from anxiety and pure OCD from the past and I go to therapy , but since I had the baby I was feeling much better. It was like everything was gone. I feel like all the strategies that my therapist have told me I can’t even put them in place anymore. I feel so overwhelmed.
I went to the doctor yesterday and he upped my dose of antidepressants so hopefully that helps because I feel so lost. 
I am hating the feeling of detachment I’m having towards him since the last few days. I am not sure if it is due the lack of sleep and the chronic fatigue as he is not sleeping much. 
I really would like to hear other stories to see if I am not alone in this position and gets better. 
I feel numbed, tired, sad, super anxious… I was always so caring and loveable person and I don’t understand what is happening to me. My baby is much wanted and he is all we were dreaming about.

778,"My wife had our baby 8 days ago. She came home on day 5. 

She forbade me to be in the birthing room because I don't speak the local language well enough to communicate with the doctors or be a medical proxy. I reluctantly agreed. Her mom went instead. After she came home,  she accused me of abandoning her at the hospital. I asked her if she heard herself or remembered the long arguments where I said I wanted to be there and I was scared to leave her alone. She said even if I spoke the local language, I would have abandoned her because that's the kind of person I am. 

Now, she is chasing me for every little error I make. Microwave door open? She points at it and asks me if I'm 5 and why she has to remind me. 

We both get up at night to feed/burp the baby, but I am so anxious about our marriage that I can't fall back to sleep afterward. So I get about 1-2 hours of sleep a night while she gets 3-4. I do all the house chores when i get home and cook breakfast and dinner, but if I do them not exactly how she would, she reminds me and chastised me for being lazy. 

MIL comes in the day time to help with baby. Recently MIL is doing the same thing wife is. Chastising me for this and thay, getting involved in disagreements my wife and I have had in the past. When I stand up to MIL and gently but sarcastically tell her off (b/c I'm not married to her and don't have to take anything from her) wife blames me for being rude. 

I'm literally assaulted from all sides and my wife refuses to see any wrong in her mother and all the wrong in me. She gaslights me and demands that I apologize. Blames me that she doesn't have enough milk for the baby. 

In a rare lucid moment, she admitted that she would be offended if my mother did to her what her mother does to me. My parents are far away though and can't help. But she still says I should apologize and accept her mother's rudeness.

I cannot sustain this. I might be able to if I could sleep. But I can't. I gently suggested investigating PPA/PPD to my wife earlier and she says I'm gaslighted her. Don't tell me it will be over in 6 months to a year. I will either have suffered a psychotic break or have left by that time. Help. 

Edit to say that I have already bared my heart to her, ugly cried and pleaded with her just to try to be nice.

We have argued quite a lot about it too as I found him looking at other women on his phone and when I mention that he says things like “what do you expect me to do” I don’t know if I’m being stupid by getting upset at the fact he’s looking at other women but I’m also not fulfilling his needs so do I just have to be ok with it? I hate my body and the way that I feel and it just makes me feel worse. He also makes me feel like it’s not normal to feel like this and I don’t know how to help him understand. Like is he meaning to make me feel like this? Does he not have respect for me anymore? ( I had asked if he could just not look at other women whilst I feel how I do about myself, even too look at pictures of me instead) I really want to be happy especially for my new baby but I feel like I just think about this a lot and it really does get me down. Im having to worry and stress about this as well as everything that comes with taking care of a newborn. Im also breastfeeding and doing every night shift on my own as he works throughout the day so I’m always tired and that’s another thing that gets to me. He mentions me starting work again a lot (which I’m also not ready for) and when I say about me doing every night shift he says it’s because he has to get up for work but I feel like I have to do the same thing (having a baby is a job to me) and maybe if he did the night shift a few times a week I’d be less tired and have more energy to think about having sex.

790,"This is a situation that I’ve been having a hard time trying to figure out how to approach and deal with.. My husband hasn’t been helping with the baby as much as I thought he would. It’s been 7 weeks so far and I feel like he still hasn’t gotten a grasp of taking care of the baby or even really helping me with him. He seems to just do his own thing and he does tell me “if you need anything, let me know”, but I find myself not even bothering most of the time because I feel like I end up having to step in anyway. I have talked to him about it before and mentioned to him how I’m having a hard time, my postpartum depression has been effecting me a lot, and how I need him to help out more rather than just do his own thing at first. Prior to this, he did mention to me he had some depression which worried me. He does become rather avoidant of some responsibilities when he gets depressed. Which I’m not saying as an excuse, because I clearly am depressed too and have been having to deal with the majority of the baby care. He started to put in some effort, but I feel like he went back to not helping as much again. 
We do live with my parents for now because it’s easier for us financially and my husband is deploying overseas in January. Although I do highly appreciate the help from my parents, I feel like they have been helping more with the baby than my own husband and I can feel my dad’s judgement from across the room every single day about my husband’s lack of effort. It honestly stresses me out a lot. 
I’ve had two incidents recently that are starting to get me to my breaking point.. Yesterday I made a comment about going back to work possibly soon and he seemed upset about it. His paternity leave is much longer than my maternity leave (and even paid) so he essentially said he doesn’t want to take care of the baby alone which is why he doesn’t want me to go back to work yet. I found this extremely frustrating because I myself take care of the baby alone all the time. Not to mention I was only going back maybe 1-2 shifts a week for 4 hours (it’s a part time job) to ease into it. I also really love my job for once and have been missing it. It’s one thing I’ve been missing about myself prior to having a baby since I feel like I’ve been losing so much about me. 
Then today my baby has been extra fussy and a little harder to sooth him. When my baby is with my husband, he can’t seem to soothe him at all and my baby even seems to get louder. My dad tells me “you know why he does that with him? It’s cause he isn’t used to him” before he went to bed… 
Now I’m here stuck wondering what to do. I know my husband doesn’t mean to be like this. I know it’s not malicious or anything like that “you’re the wife/mom so it’s your job”. I really feel like he gets very overwhelmed trying to take care of the baby and doesn’t know how to go about it even when I’ve tried to help. I don’t want to nag him or get on him like he’s a child, but I also don’t want him just getting away with all of this. He’s leaving to go overseas soon and I really don’t want him missing out on the first few months of our son’s life because he’s not even going to be able to see him again til he turns 1.
I really hope this gets better and I can figure out a way to communicate that I need more involvement from him without it causing an argument or any issues.",,"situation hard time try figure approach deal husband not help baby much think would   week far feel like still not get grasp take care baby even really help seem thing tell need anything let know find even bother time feel like end step anyway talk mention hard time postpartum depression effect lot need help rather thing first prior mention depression worry become rather avoidant responsibility get depress say excuse clearly depressed deal majority baby care start put effort feel like go back help much

Anytime I tell people that they say “well yeah, you’ve got three babies”. Thanks, not helpful. But..it’s like my soul is tired. I get plenty of sleep for the most part. But down to my bones I’m just..tired. Burnt out I guess. Tired of feeling unheard. My toddlers don’t listen to a word I say. “They’re toddlers”. Yeah, I know, thank you, but they LITERALLY don’t listen to a word I say. Something has got to change. They listen to their dad. He comes home and all I want to do is be listened to. Tell a story where he’s engaged, making eye contact, not changing the subject or saying “haha look at the baby” when I’m mid sentence. My kids don’t listen, he doesn’t listen. I stop talking mid sentence sometimes to see if anyone notices and they never do. I do so much for them, and I know if I died tomorrow, I’d be missed, but right now, it feels like everyone would just miss having clean clothes and food. My husband has to work a lot. Because We have three babies. And I can’t complain, because we’ve been blessed with three healthy babies that I’m able to stay home with. I can’t complain. Everyone tells me “you’re so blessed”. I know I’m blessed. I feel blessed. But I feel empty a lot of the time too. I cry so much more than I used to. I love my kids so so so much. But I feel like I’m just a vessel holding love for them. I’m nothing else. The old me is gone and I can’t find her anywhere. I have hobbies but little time to do them. I know this is just a season of life. My rational brain knows that. “These are the good old days”, “don’t wish their lives away”, “some day you’ll miss the fingerprints on everything”. I know. And part of the reason I cry all the time is the guilt I feel about that. I love them. But I’m so tired. But to wake up every day to the same stuff “no don’t touch that”, “don’t hit your brother”, “please don’t wake the baby”.. I’m so tired. I’ve never tried therapy but I feel like I need to. Something just doesn’t feel right. I’ve lost myself sometime in these past 3 years and every now and then I’ll get a glimpse my old self, but I can never get ahold of her for any significant period of time. I can’t afford therapy and insurance likely won’t cover it. Waiting to see if it’s approved so fingers crossed. I don’t want medication. I just need someone to listen to me. Even if they have to be paid to do it. I need confirmation that I’m not just a ghost, I do really exist and people can hear me. I’m also anxious, overstimulated, my needs are rarely met, and then, after a long hard day, I’m laying in bed and I get the tap on my shoulder from my husband. But my sex drive is absolutely gone has been since baby #1. “That’s normal, you have 3 babies”.  I would love to feel normal again. But I don’t remember what normal feels like. 
And I would never hurt myself or my kids. Never. They’re my whole heart. But I’m at my lowest right now.

792,"Hi everyone, posting here because I'm learning the hard way that men can get postpartum depression. And, as someone who's also been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder (formerly diagnosed with Chronic Depression) this has been extra challenging.

I'm thankful to have an amazing wife who's been extremely supportive throughout this, but I don't have any friends I can talk to about this, and I've been struggling a lot. I've been on meds that work really well for the past 3 years, and this past week it's like they just stopped working. And even though I'm no stranger to depression, I forgot how fucking debilitating it can be.

Fortunately, this hasn't resulted in any negative feelings towards our beautiful baby boy or towards my incredibly kind and supportive wife, but I'm barely getting through the day. Also, as a man with mental illness, I've suppressed my desire to cry so many times from a young age that I can't cry when I know I need to (this has been a problem for years). I've even started to get up earlier than normal to do yoga and meditation and clean, but it just feels like it's barely holding back the storm instead of actually making things better.

I just want to be the best husband, father, and me I can be, but I'm struggling.

So, any dads here with PPD? Or anybody here who has pre-existing mental illness?

Apologies ahead of time, a lot of this is ramblings I just need to get off my chest.


My son was very wanted. I struggled for two years TTC, ended up having to do IVF and had our miracle baby. Since having him, I have good days where I just have all the good energy to play with him, but there’s other days where I just stare at him and think I’m not good enough to be a mom. I keep thinking he should have a better mom - someone who can care for him in ways I struggle to. I feel like he deserves so much better. I was holding him yesterday and I just burst out crying because I felt like I don’t deserve him. I had to immediately give him to my husband and walk away for a bit.

My relationship with my husband is rocky, but it got worse since a few days ago because I didn’t think about something and my husband has had enough. Words exchanged can’t be unheard. He’s usually very loving to me, but last few days he barely speaks to me, which makes me feel very alone and broken as a person. He’s always been incredibly supportive and patient throughout our relationship. He says he still loves me, but something is different now and it’s severely impacting my mental health. Our relationship is literally hanging on by a thread but divorce is out of the question. And he isn’t the type of person who would ever want to do couple’s counseling. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells, afraid of what I’m going to do to mess things up again.

Most of yesterday I just kept thinking I don’t want to be here. The thought of growing older and actually being responsible in raising a child gives me way too much anxiety. I feel like I can’t do it. I had a good upbringing but I feel like I can’t do the same for my son because our house right now just feels broken. I have trouble planning ahead because I mostly just think about myself and what serves my needs. I’ve been like this most of my life that it’s been such a struggle for me to break free from it. I’m used to others planning stuff for me, but when I have to do it I get immense anxiety because I keep overthinking that it’s not good.

I just don’t want to be here but I’m too much of a coward to do anything about it. I don’t want to live but I keep thinking about everyone I love and them wondering why I made such a selfish decision. I can’t talk to anyone about this because I know what everyone will say… but I’m really struggling right now. I didn’t know who else to turn to, so I’m posting here.

I’m really struggling mentally. I just feel sorry for my son and husband that they have to deal with me. I’m just sorry all the time. I’m just… really struggling to get through the day.

Oh, good morning Momma Guilt. Yes, I slept through most of the night. Yes, I let dad take care of him through the night. Yes… maybe you’re right.. maybe I am a bad mother for last night… 

Oh, good morning Postpartum Body Dysmorphia. I really need to change out of this nighty.. I’ve been wearing it for two days straight now, and it’s covered in spit up and baby urine… But nothing fits anymore, not like it should. This is a new body, stretched and worn, maybe I won’t ever like the way I look ever again… 

Oh, good morning Postpartum Depression. I slipped and dropped my pumped milk this morning… and my world came crashing down. How could I be so careless, surely I must punish myself for this… Will the tears ever stop? Will the pain in my chest ever calm down? 

Oh, good morning my precious baby son. When you look up at me with those beautiful blue eyes, all my worries wash away. Your little toothless smile brightens up my world more than you could ever know. When I feel your heart beating on my chest, and feel your precious little breaths on my cheek, I know we’re both gonna get through this stage of life just fine, as long as we always have each other. 

Oh, good morning Momma. You still have tear streaks stained on your cheeks while you make that bottle for your son, but you’re gonna make it. You’re a powerful woman, and a wonderful momma. Don’t let the anxiety, or depression, or body dysmorphia, or guilt ever make you believe otherwise. You will rock today, and tomorrow, and everyday after.

Back story I had a traumatic emergency C-section and most people know how that goes. You lose 30 minutes of a golden hour it’s traumatic sometimes and just not a good time 

I spoke with my spouse about this and about how I felt our son hated me and I could tell and I feel like he wasn’t even mine 
My spouse was so loving and caring for my physical needs after the birth cooking, cleaning, helping me get dressed but he doesn’t really understand how to mentally be there for someone. He had a lot of love but not in the right way for my mentality.

Well I kind of forced myself on my son and always told him I loved him and would snuggle him but it didn’t get better till about 3 months ago. Honestly I’m just on a rant and I want other moms to know it gets better and I believe in you.

800,"I'm dealing with postpartum depression and anxiety and although we had our baby 8 months ago, it's still very intense. I'm in therapy, medicated, but as you all know, that only goes so far and doesn't always ""cure"" some of these hormonal fluctuations.

We've had sex only 3 times since our baby was born. And actually, in nearly a year, because we didn't have sex for a few months leading up to the birth. I was unable to orgasm any of those times because he finished before I could and then I just felt gross so I got cleaned up and dressed. It makes me feel fat, ugly and hideous when I can't finish.

Sex is huge for me. I need that connection, that intimacy. I used to be in the adult entertainment industry, my husband knows this, he knows that I feel so uncomfortable with my body postpartum because of the changes. However, that doesn't mean I'm not sexual with him. I try to initiate a lot, I try to compliment him a lot, but he's always ""too stressed"" which is fine, I get it. He got a new position at work earlier this year and it's been incredibly stressful. Stress can make it difficult for him to perform. Because of this new job, he's missed a lot of our baby's first year, I've been alone with her and our other kid a lot.

I happened to be on his tablet to show him something. When I opened his browser, I opened a new tab and saw that he'd recently been viewing a lot of porn. It really upset me. I know he's allowed to watch that, he can do whatever he wants. But ffs, I'm here, begging to be fucked, and he's off watching porn instead of coming to me? I don't care if he uses it to get going, as long as it finishes with me. He knows, with my history in the adult entertainment field, I get very uncomfortable with porn because it's one of those ""what I was"" and ""what I am now"" things.

So now I feel like I'm unreasonably upset about this. Because I know he has needs but so do I. And I feel like he was ignoring my needs and wants and went straight to porn vs asking me to suck him off or whatever. It sounds so silly, because of all people, everyone says I should be fine with it. That I could watch porn too. Yes, I could, but there's nothing out there I enjoy - I really find my husband to be the epitome of sexual attractiveness and he's not out there filming porn. 

I'm so mad and upset with him. And because of my PPD/a, my thoughts run wild and they run to ""divorce him, you're not worthy of him"" and I hate that. He knows I'm struggling and that my brain is going to these places. That I feel horrible, ugly. I still suffer from DMER with breastfeeding occasionally and going from sexy to a cow hurts a lot.

803,"My birth experience was not smooth sailing and a bit chaotic so I feel like my mental decline started there. I had to get a c-section very last minute at my 38 week appointment because my blood pressure was not coming down and my baby was still breech. I barely had anything ready and set up at home too. After I had my baby things still continued to feel chaotic. I had what I was told was acid reflux throughout my pregnancy but it turned out to be gallbladder attacks. I went to the ER for one after my birth and was told it was actually my gallbladder. I had to stay at a hospital out of town for 4 days. I only stayed for so long because the gastroenterologist I was given drug everything out.. I didn’t even have the problem solved while there and he made me make an outpatient appointment after my stay to get things done.. Then a hurricane came through my area and thankfully we weren’t affected but my city was pretty shut down and it slowed down my progress on getting things done. Then I had to go back to the ER because my c-section incision had a small opening on one end (thankfully it’s healed now). That same night I had the worst gallbladder attack that also gave me a horrible panic attack. The pain lasted for 3 days and I went back to the ER on the third day. My levels elevated due to my gastroenterologist procrastinating my procedure. I got sent back to the hospital out of town to stay the night and then have my procedure. For 3-4 days after my procedure I was in a lot of pain and had so much soreness. They also didn’t take out my gallbladder and only put a stent in the duct so I’ve been paranoid that the pain will eventually come back. 
So overall, I mix of crazy issues with my health and being set back with a lot of things I’ve been trying to get done, I’ve felt so lost and alone. This is my first baby and it’s all so new. I feel like I’ve been struggling so much more than I’m supposed to. I end up feeling so trapped and lonely in my own house when I even still live with my parents with my husband. I end up spending the whole day in the living room taking care of my fussy baby and mindlessly watching tv to keep me from being in my head too long. I have a hard time doing things I enjoy because I lost interest or feel like I can’t do it without being stopped. Being in my own room overwhelms me cause it’s so small and gets messy so fast.

822,"Trigger warning*(talks of self harm)


I think I have developed PPD, my doctor told me it was likely to happen do to me suffering from depression as a teen. Back then I hated myself, how skinny I was and how weak I was. From that I'd punish myself by cutting and I also abused alcohol. As I gotten older I grew to love myself more and now only drink wine recreationally. Fast forward, I started dating my best friend, we got married, bought a house together, are both students and he's also military, and I just pushed out our baby boy this Monday. I thought I'd be fine as I’d been only having an issue with accepting my new body during pregnancy. I never to account that my issue with feeling like a burden to my husband(he takes care of me a lot and its sometimes hard for me to see the things I do for him) would come to hunt me. After having our son I felt so absolutely happy. Things started to take a dive since I'd been struggling with all the pain that comes with labor, not being able to do much as you risk hurting yourself further, and not being able to breastfeed if you're taking medications such as opioids. With this being my current reality I've developed feelings of hopelessness, nightmares/trouble sleeping, feeling useless and pathetic, and overall feeling like a failure as a person and as a new mother. I realized it was hitting the lines of PPD when I started to feel like my husband and son would be better without me, like I didn't deserve the great treatment or happiness, and like I wanted to give up completely( let go of life) whenever the extreme pain strikes. My mind for some reason can't understand that its the first few days after labor, so of course I shouldn't be doing too much, of course I’ll have to wait to breastfeed(I've been pumping and dumping to keep up supply for when I can use it), and of course I’ll feel useless or like a failure due to small mistakes or not being able to fully help out or see the things I do do. I fully understand all of this, though even then, my mind is still beating me down, I've been crying so much and saying and thinking horrible things about myself. I fear I’m falling into a hole again, most of me wants to stay there. My husband is so supportive but sometimes I hate that he helps me so much, I feel like he deserves someone who’s stronger, more independent, has full confidence in their selves. I love him and my son more than anything in the world, but I can't lose the feeling that I’m holding them back.

824,"Going back to work is making my postpartum depression a lot worse. My job got changed right before I went on leave to one that has a lot more responsibilities than what I had before, and it’s stressing me out. 

My DH is usually very loving and kind, but he doesn’t understand anything about my parenting style and goals. Even before we got married I said I wanted to have kids and homeschool them. Eventually I compromised by saying I would go back to work when our child is able to be safe at daycare. I’m traumatized by stories of daycare workers abusing babies. It’s my biggest fear. I said I wanted to stay home for six more months on unpaid leave (my job has to offer me back a position), and he said no because he doesn’t want to pay 600 USD a month for insurance. Instead he wants his mom and other family members to watch the baby while I go to work. As an added bonus, his mom doesn’t like me and doesn’t feel strong enough to lift the baby. Why tf should I leave the baby with her? 

If I quit my job, he said he won’t buy me anything. I’m not expecting steak dinners, but it hurts to know he thinks it’s okay to say I can never go get a Starbucks or get my roots done every couple of months. He pretty much said he wouldn’t let me make a single financial decision in the household if I quit. Not even food. 

I could get it if he didn’t have the money, but he literally makes 3x more than I do. It makes me mad he won’t even ask his job what insurance would be if I quit my job. If I tell people I’m struggling I just get told “there’s no need for you to be depressed. Most people have it worse than you”. 

Now I also have my mom telling me I’m a bad mom because I’m “putting my job above my kids” and that she didn’t raise me to be that way. She knows that I didn’t choose going back so it just feels worse. I feel like I can’t win and I’ll need a lot of mental help when I go back to work because I don’t feel stable anymore.

826,"Trying to keep it brief; apologies if this doesn't make sense I'm really in a dark place.

I had a severe bout of depression start last week. I've never experienced anything like this before in my life. Psychiatrist thinks it was triggered by a perfect storm of sleep deprivation, weaning off night time breastfeeds and underlying trauma/undiagnosed ADHD/ASD. 

I've been bed bound up until yesterday. I was nearly sectioned because I couldn't think past not wanting to be alive anymore. I've had intensive home treatment with daily visits from psychiatrist and psych nurse. I've started multiple meds. The psychiatrist basically gave my partner an ultimatum: ""keep her here under your supervision or she will have to be admitted to the hospital"". It's a lot for him; he's suddenly found himself having to run the house and care for our 3.5yo and 11mo. Work have given him paid leave. We don't want me to go into hospital. We're in the UK and past the threshold for the local MBU because my baby turns 1 in 2 weeks time. The idea of a general psych ward fills me with dread and I don't see myself getting better there

Anyway, since I've been able to get out of bed my partner keeps taking out his frustrations on me. He wanted to have a shower and said ""you need to watch the kids so I can wash"". I had literally just woken up after minimal sleep and they were both upset (a huge trugger for me right now). They'd not had breakfast, got dressed or had their teeth brushed. They were both sat in front of the TV having not had a proper breakfast just eating dry cereal from a bowl. I instantly went into a meltdown; crying and panicking to the point I nearly left the house then remembered the police would be called if I did. His response was ""what do you want me to do I need to wash?!"". I tried to explain I am just overwhelmed and he said ""how do you think I feel?!"". It's clear he's not coping and as much as I'd like to be able to snap out of this I just can't. 

He also keeps asking me questions like ""what meals shall I plan this week?"", ""can you call the bank to approve this that or the other"", ""what gift shall I take to the birthday party she is going to tomorrow"", ""what are our plans for next weekend now that you're not well"". My head is literally fried, everything he asks I start to panic and get overwhelmed because I can sense the underlying frustration in his tone.

The chaos around me of the children and the mess in the house is adding to my guilt. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm a failure as a mother and partner. They need me so much and I just can't do what I normally do right now. How can I help him understand I'm not just being lazy? This is SO unlike me and I just don't know how to communicate what I'm going through.

He's not a bad man he is struggling. We're on our knees as a family.

827,"I’m seeking advice on ways to prevent postpartum depression. I have three sons. My first, who is now 7, was very calm as a baby. He would eat, sleep, and cry very little. I could go anywhere with him without worrying about crying in public or feeling overwhelmed. 

However, my second child was the opposite—he cried almost 24/7, and it was exhausting both mentally and physically. My mom helped for a while, but after she left, I felt stuck at home. I couldn’t go anywhere because his crying was relentless, even in the car. My personality is quite introverted, so I avoided going out. I fell into a cycle of depression that lasted four years. It was such a difficult time, and I felt like I was losing control. I became paranoid about my health, convinced I had every disease, and went through multiple tests, including CT scans, MRIs, and colonoscopies. I knew I wasn’t well, but I felt powerless to stop it. Thankfully, as my son grew, he became a sociable, smart, and funny kid, and my mental health improved.

Recently, I had my third son about a month ago, hoping he would be more like my first. However, he cries a lot, and I’m experiencing the same challenges as before. I can’t take a shower, cook, or do anything for myself. He doesn’t sleep at night, and during the day, he only naps for 10 minutes before crying again. I’m terrified of slipping into depression once more, especially now that I have responsibilities towards my other children and need to complete my thesis by December.

He’s 11 months and has been waking up like CRAZY for the past month, and it usually takes me and my husband 2 hours to put him back to sleep. Nothing we do works. It’s so fucking frustrating. 
I’m writing this after having a major rage episode with him, after 2 hours of trying to put him to bed. I screamed so much at him, said some pretty hurtful and heavy stuff, and just threw him in the crib, like I couldn’t care less.. 
I’m treating ppd for a couple of months now, and it’s been great with the medication, but as soon as he has these long night wakes I lose my shit. 
I know I’m going to feel waaaay worse tomorrow, and I’ll just cry my eyes out for doing that to him. He’s probably gonna hate me or be afraid of me. 
I know it’s traumatizing doing that to him, and I do regret every single word I said, and the way I acted. But I just can’t “control” myself, I’m so tired and so done with this.


Note: I’m reading all the comments and I’m so thankful for this community ❤️ thank you all for understanding my situation and my feelings. I’ll try to answer every comment, but I just wanted to say a couple more things:
- Me and my husband are pretty much alone, our families live in another country.. So it gets pretty hard sometimes :(
- I love the idea of cosleeping, but whenever I try my baby just gets really agitated, and he keeps looking for me on the bed (even though I’m literally right there next to him, holding his hand). I cannot tell you guys how many times he slapped me, pulled my hair, head-bumped me, and so on.. So honestly and sadly I do think he’s going to sleep better in the crib. 
- I’m treating PPD with medication but I also have ADHD, which I also take medication for.. So for me it gets really hard to control my emotions when I get overwhelmed and overstimulated. I know it’s not an excuse, it’s more about context.
- We are currently trying the “divide and conquer” approach: if baby wakes up until 3am, my husband goes, and after that it’s me.. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it just makes us more tired. But we’ll figure it out!
- the main thing is that if it comes to a point where I’m feeling the rage and frustration coming, I’ll definitely put him in the crib and walk away. I still feel like shit for what I did and said to him that day, and it’s pretty hard to forgive myself. ",,"feel like absolute bad mother world not patience leave baby night

To keep it short, I just gave birth four months ago. I caught my partner cheating on me two months postpartum. He said sorry but never really done anything to help me get through the pain. We reconciled. But I haven’t really felt some sort of genuine apology from him.

I have been asking me to just atleast consider my feelings for our baby. Especially, I am the sole physically present parent for him. Knowing he is living 10 hours away from us due to his nature of work. I have been really understanding but I exploded for the nth time again tonight because I have learnt that he followed another woman’s alter account using his alter account which I find it bullshit.

I confronted him and he told me it’s just a woman he has known for a long time but I know that is not the case. Should it just be that, why follow using an alter account? And the fact that he has been one of the first people to be followed by the woman.

Now, we got into another argument and I just really do not know anymore. I feel like I am dealing with someone who cannot even change even just at least for the child involved.",,"

I produce a lot so we’ve been feeding him milk from that time frame over the week.

This week we noticed his sleep take a serious turn for the worse. Irritability and screaming and just acting very weird. He hasn’t pooped in a while so that’s what I thought it was. It was only a few days ago that I had the realization to google nicotine in breastmilk and discovered what a piece of shit I am.

I can’t even look in the mirror. I can’t look at him. I can’t move on. My husband is urging me to try to forgive myself and move on but I can’t. Because who does this to an innocent helpless baby who needed me? He more than likely developed a small addiction and is withdrawing from it, he can’t sleep anymore without being held all night long. I’m sick and fucking disgusted with myself and I don’t feel like I deserve to breathe air anymore. He deserves a better mother. Someone who wouldn’t even be tempted by bullshit like an e cig. I hate myself and want to disappear. I don’t think I will ever be able to move on from this for the rest of my life. He is the greatest gift of my entire life and I fucking ruined him by introducing harmful chemicals into his little body. 

I don’t know what I’m even looking for here. I wanted to call my mom and vent but I’m ashamed. I don’t even want to tell my therapist because I’m so embarrassed of my actions.

843,"TLDR; after 3.5 years being with my kid nearly 24/7 99% of their life …I am now 50/50 co-parenting and I don’t miss my kid when she’s at Dad’s. I’m not even inclined for goodnight face times. I feel bad that I don’t miss her or want to call her. 

My kid is 3.5. I am co-parenting, and have been emotionally separate from the dad since I was pregnant and physically separated since kid was 2.  The whole post partum so far has been tough on me, I did not get a lot of support emotionally or even physically at all-  hence the separation. I pretty much was a totally single mom. I did everything with very little offer for help, not even help around the house!!  I also was EBF. Pandemic baby. 

The first time I even was away from my kid EVER they were already 1.5 and I had to practically beg with over a month’s notice for him to watch her alone so I could have my first girls day/ DAY OFF since I gave birth. 

When she was around 3 and I was EXHAUSTED, separated and nagging Dad to please take her, I had realized I have been physically and even a large portion of the time skin to skin with my kid for 3 years straight minus MAYBE 2 weeks out of the entire time.  

I also wfh and cannot afford childcare. 

In the last month or so he is now finally getting more consistent with the schedule and he’s been taking her about 50/50.  

Now that I am getting real time for myself sometimes I realize I go all day and  I don’t even miss my kid. Today I realized the whole day went by and I didn’t even have desire to call for goodnights. I feel bad about it. some post of moms here that really struggle doing custody split and I am here not even thinking about my kid at all. 

Is this normal? I feel like I should be missing my kid more and wanting to call her but I figure dad’s time is his time and I don’t want to interrupt or make her emotional seeing me because we have attachment style and I know it’s hard for her. 

Dad of course is a nuisance with constantly FaceTiming 2-3 times a day during my time. I honestly detest it. My kid also hates it she will literally kick and scream crying that she doesn’t want to talk. So I figure she doesn’t even like FT so why stress her out? So I am rarely initiating FT but Dad insists that she say good night to me. So he does FT me usually every night he has her (she never fights him on it like she does with me.) Tonight I could tell she miss me she was trying not to cry. I felt like it would been better for me not to FT but he texted saying “she wants to say goodnight” but I honestly don’t think she even brought it up, I am sure he is the one that suggested it. 

I don’t know why he insist on FT and is so adamant about the good night every night. Like she literally rejects him and cries EVERY TIME but he still forces the FT every night. I hate it. I just want my time and his time and not have to facilitate face times. Am I wrong to feel this way? (there is no court order or plan. We are not involving courts)

Should I miss my kid more? I feel like it’s probably normal given the context but also feels not normal. I feel like I SHOULD want to call and at least say goodnight but I honestly don’t think it’s necessary.

845,"Firstly I want to thank everyone in this group that helped me get through some very tough time.
A few months ago my wife went through extreme post partum depression with two episodes and being sectioned twice. Dozens of suicide attempts.

As a father and a husband who was just blessed with twin babies, boy and a girl. It was a very tough time. 

I am pleased to tell all of you my wife is finally back home and finally smiling and living her normal life. When even going out for grocery shopping looked impossible, we are travelling together with our twin babies.

For all the mums and dads struggling with post partum depression, remember it gets better. No matter how hard it gets, it will get better. Trust your health providers but be involved in decision making for your partner. At the end remember they need you. You have to give your 110%. I used to work from 9-5 and spend 5-12 at the hospital with my wife.
With mental health medicines, they take time. At the end stay strong and have faith.

847,"I had my c-section a week ago, and my relationship with my husband is now stained. Maybe it’s the postpartum depression, or maybe it’s something else. It all started one day after the c-section, I was still stuck on the hospital bed and my mother in law came visit. She was holding my baby, and he started crying so my mother took him from her so I could breastfeed him. Her face dropped and my husband told me to tell my mother to let his mother mind the baby as she would only be in the country for 3 weeks. I appreciate her flying all the way here, and wanting to help and all but I just prefer my mum’s help. I was falling asleep then I overheard my husband talking to his mother saying my mom had been a great help and all but she should leave and stuff, to add to that my husband had been frosty to my dad as well, so I broke down and told my mum about that. My mum cried but she tried to calm me down as well, then left to let my mother in law mind the baby. The second day after the surgery, I broke down again because I don’t like how she treats the baby like he’s hers. She didn’t mention to him about me, she didn’t hand him back to me so I could feed him when he started crying, instead she offered him a bottle without letting me try to breastfeed him first, and also she has a cold  and runny nose but not bother to wear a mask (my baby and I eventually caught it from her). I broke down and told my husband I wanted to hold my baby, he told his mom not to take it personally and that I wanted to hold my baby as I haven’t gotten to much. His mum left the room and for once there were just the baby, my husband and I in the room. After a while my husband went to check on his mum and he found her crying in the hallway. So I felt like she tried to make it about herself once again. She did that on our honeymoon as well. She decided to complain about me to my husband, saying she couldn’t get to know me, how we didn’t have deep enough conversations while I thought we were fine. After that I felt more self-conscious around her, I felt like I have to ask questions for the sake of asking questions otherwise she would go and tell my husband. I don’t hate her or anything, but we weren’t close to begin with so I just feel awkward and tense whenever she’s around, and she was around every afternoon during our hospital stay up until the last day when I had enough and just walked out of the hospital room. She then got upset and my husband blamed me saying I was being rude and so on. And he went back home with his mum that night. I just felt like he always put his mum first, even before checking into the hospital, he kept asking me whether he has to sleep at the hospital with me, he said he worried how his mum was going to get food and stuff as she was/is staying in our house (i already taught her how to use food ordering app). The next day my husband came back to the hospital just before we checked out, we had a talk and I told him how I felt around his mum. He said I was being a nightmare and I should grow up. We got back home and his mum decided to check herself into a hotel, and my husband said it’s because of me. I decided it would be better for me to go to my hometown for a while as I felt depressed, sleep deprived and I just need my mum’s help. I told him that and we had another talk, and this time it really changed the way I feel towards him. I told him I can’t do this alone, and that I need my support system. He said I’m incapable and that he’s disappointed in me. He said now that the baby’s here, I have to clean the house, mind the baby, cook him food and so on. His voice was cold when he said that, like he’s a different person. I asked him how does he expect me to do everything when my stitches weren’t even fully heal and that I’m sleep deprived, he said he doesn’t care and it’s my job, which I know it’s my job and I have no problem doing that, but hearing that from his mouth really took me by surprise. I said I felt like he has changed and he said he had put up with my mood swings for 9 months during the pregnancy, and now he expected me to stop having mood swings and step up. He said him being nice to me got him nothing, and that I was being ungrateful to him by not cooking food the last while, which I wasn’t aware of as whenever I asked him what he wanted for food, he always said it’s okay and that he wanted me to relax instead of cooking. And he complained that I changed a lot since I got pregnant, how I didn’t go to social events with him anymore, in my defence, I gained a lot of weight and didn’t want to be seen, he understood back then and said it’s okay but now he claimed it’s an issue. It’s been a few days now since we had that talk, he eventually agreed to let me go to my hometown with my mum next week and he’s been trying to act as caring as before as both our moms are still here in the house with us, but I can’t get over what he said. Also I feel like his feeling for me is different now. Like he only asked about our baby, how’s the baby, and nothing about me. He used to kiss me goodbye before work everyday and now there’s nothing. I feel like I’m just a baby sitter in my own house. Not the postpartum experience I thought we would have. I’m afraid this is the end of us. I’ll be away from him for a month and I don’t know what would happen when I come back, there’re so many things that he said that took me by surprise already.

849,"Im exactly 1 week postpartum and it's been hard just bearing the ppd in silence today. My bf is amazing and supportive, however I feel the need to ""protect"" him from the crazy that is about to unfold with how raw my nerves and emotions are. I can feel the depression building and as soon as he walks out of the door tomorrow I am going to erupt in wailing and tears until I can fall back asleep. 
As usual after giving birth I have 0 support other than him, no family or friends visiting, its just me, 4 walls, my newborn and resounding silence that echoes and goes on for hours. Ruminating about how alone i am in the world except for bf. Im lacking a woman in my life though and lacking that care that a female relative or friend gives- Instead its just me caring for everyone, no one spoon feeding me and waiting on me hand and foot as it should be, if only for a day here and there.
I can't wait for him to leave for work in the morning so that I can let it all hang out, I want to cry and sleep all day without anyone around to be freaked out or upset by the ppd on display. 
It's so all consuming, it's like all of the grief I've ever felt is hitting at once, all of the lack and the absence of things that are missing pieces in my life has me feeling helpless. Feeling the absence of a sensitive feminine and caring/nurturing presence in my life. Or the hope that my social and emotional needs will ever be met. Bf is only a man and only one person and he does enough to support our household financially so it's just a void I'm falling into.. having to carry on as usual as if my organs dont feel like theyre prolapsing and I don't feel like fainting and or crying half the time. 
I'm also an addict in recovery and thoughts of using and or killing myself are creeping through my psyche. Even though I love my children and bf, I feel insecure sexually and undesirable and that is fucking with me. Like how can I actually be thinking that my bf would be happier if I were gone and he could replace me as a mother with someone who is more sexually attractive. I don't deserve him and I can't be everything he wants or needs probably. Shit that creeps through my thoughts even though it's irrational to think this way.

851,"Hello Angels on earth..

I’m 4 weeks postpartum, and I should be happy, soaking in these precious moments with my newborn. But instead, I feel crushed and drained, mostly because of my mom. My parents flew in from another country to help during pregnancy and after delivery. They’ll be here until December (the tickets are already booked), but honestly, I don’t know how I’m going to survive until then.

I just had my first baby, and instead of feeling supported and loved, I feel like I’m drowning in judgment and negativity, especially from my mom. During pregnancy, she constantly accused me of betraying my family and being selfish, all because I wasn’t bending over backward for people who never even cared about me. She doesn’t like my husband—she never has. Where we’re from, love marriages are still frowned upon, and because my husband isn’t some rich, fair-skinned guy, she can’t stand him. It’s like no matter how good he is to me, she can’t see past her outdated ideals.

She stressed me out so much during pregnancy, and I feel like it’s happening all over again now that I’m postpartum. It’s like she can’t stand to see my husband helping me. She makes these snide comments and gets angry when he’s by my side, even though he’s just trying to take care of me and the baby. My sibling, who’s been staying with us and paying rent, isn’t much better. They don’t like my husband either. It’s this constant tension in the house, and they’re always upset when my husband’s parents want to check in on us or see their grandchild. It’s their first grandchild, and they just want to be involved, but every time they call, my mom and sibling give me this disapproving look.

The worst part was during delivery. It was so rough—at one point, the doctors were trying to save me and the baby, and my husband was scared. He needed support, so he called his family to keep them updated, which is completely understandable. But as soon as I was moved to my room, my mom found a way to make it about her. She told me she didn’t like how my in-laws were being “updated” about the situation. I mean, I had just given birth—my life and my baby’s life had been at risk, and all she could think about was how she didn’t like that my husband called his parents? I was too exhausted to fight with her, but it hurt.

It’s the same story every day. My in-laws call to check on me and the baby because they care, and every time, my mom gets upset. She even told me once that she feels like they’re “keeping an eye on her,” like this is some sort of power play. I’ve tried telling her over and over that no one is watching her, no one cares what she’s doing—they just want to see their grandchild! But she keeps making me feel like I’m in the middle of some tug-of-war, and it’s exhausting.

To make things worse, after we came home from the hospital, my husband started sleeping in the same room as me to help with the baby at night. We were both so tired, emotionally and physically drained from everything. But my mom came in and told us she didn’t like it. She said we shouldn’t act like a couple anymore, that our life has changed, and we’re supposed to be different now. I just couldn’t believe it—after everything we’d been through, she still finds ways to criticize us.

I’m so overwhelmed. I know I can’t ask them to leave because their tickets are booked for another two months, but I don’t know how I’m going to survive this. Every day feels like I’m being judged for trying to live my life, for loving my husband, for just trying to recover from everything. I can’t even enjoy being a mom because all of this is weighing me down so much. I don’t know what to do anymore—I just feel so alone in this.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to comment and support. I appreciate it more than you know. Right now, I just need to feel like someone understands what I’m going through.",,"hello angel earth

I absolutely love my baby, I just cannot feel the “want” to do things like baths, diapers, putting baby back to sleep, etc. Not all of the time, but most of the time I just would rather my husband do it. It’s just that I feel exhausted all of the time - mentally and emotionally. But I have no reason to be physically exhausted from the baby because my husband does 85% of the tasks/care. 
I want to want to. I want to not be so frustrated after the baby cries for three minutes. I just get so irritated over EVERYTHING and irrationally angry. Then I feel guilty because none of my friends seem to have experienced or feel this, my husband is frustrated by my lack of initiative, and I’m mad at myself for not wanting to. Which circles to “am I not enjoying motherhood?” Then “I’ve taken all this time for granted” 

I also find myself mourning my life before having a baby. Even though I literally do the same things. Partially, I’m being dramatic probably. But I really just don’t know what to do or what to think. I feel guilty. I’m anxious all of the time. I’m tired from work (I teach middle school, first year). I’m just unsure of what to do, what to say, what to think.

I used to be really good with words, had no issue with remembering things, and was competent. Now, I say the wrong things, forget and stumble over my words, forget everything two seconds later, sometimes in mid sentence, and it seems like I can't do the simplest tasks. 

It doesn't help my PPD or the fact that I keep having suicidal thoughts off and on. I started seeing a councilor, and she's nice, but may not be the correct one for me. I was seriously contemplating suicide, I had my plan, when I asked my husband to call offices on my behalf, they were the only ones who could get me in on short notice,  i was supposed to see someone the next day. I filled out the paperwork as soon as it was sent, but they forgot to process it until we called them a week later to ask why no one had called like they said they would (my gp even called to make sure the process was expedited). 

The first appointment, the councilor just asked me about the birth of my daughter, while was really traumatic. It didn't take her until my second appointment yesterday to actually look at my paperwork and see the boxes I had checked, which had my GP, OB, and husband scared I would do something harmful to myself. 

Honestly, the only thing keeping me here is the knowledge that if I died, my husband probably wouldn't be far behind. If that happened, I don't know what would happen to our daughter, and I don't want her placed into the system. We don't really have a village.

873,"LO is almost 6 weeks now, she was born at 36 weeks so we had challenges with latching since she was so small and also had jaundice till she was almost 3 weeks old. I almost exclusively pump on a schedule and only latch now if baby screams while i’m heating up milk or seems to want more after a bottle. 

Let me cut this short, I feel like me dying would be easier than this. I want to die. My breasts feels like it’s thrashed with pain as I write this because LO took was longer to finish a bottle and i’m now an hour late to pump on my schedule, probably a couple of plugged ducts there too. 

Usually I can count on my husband with his night shift so I can at least get uninterrupted sleep around 12-4am. But last night we had a fight because he was delaying his shift, was supposed to get LO from around 8ish but he took a nap and i let him until about 10pm. I woke him up as it was time for baby’s next feed and she was waking up. He got mad at me for not helping him warm the milk first before waking him up and questioning if i’m THAT tired that I couldn’t help with that one thing. I WAS WITH BABY THE WHOLE DAY from usually 4am and juggling pumping and her feeding schedule and diaper change and cleaning out bottles and pump parts in between trying to make the house look decent. 


I got so pissed and a part of me also feels guilty to my baby. It made me feel like a bad mom for needing a break and feeling exhausted. So I took her for the night and she’s been with me ever since. It’s now 9pm the following day. I haven’t gotten more than 2 hours of sleep at a time, my boobs are on fire and leaking everywhere, haven’t showered, only ate a cup of instant noodles and loaded up on caffeine. I guess if he wanted to help with whatever he wants at his own timing then fuck it. I’m not going to ask for help if he doesn’t care or have enough empathy or common sense to. Not too sure why moms taking care of her own child is just that but dads doing the same is called “helping”.

I don’t think I can take it anymore, this wasn’t what I imagined motherhood would look like. I don’t think i’ll ever want another. This has been hard but my maternity leave ends in about 2 months and I dread trying to juggle work and all of this when it’s time. I love my daughter to death, she’s the sweetest.

874,"Forgive my rambling, I think I just need to vent. 

I can count on one hand the times my daughter cried. Three times at the hospital before we realized she was having latching issues, once during her first diaper rash, and once when we accidentally kept her up past her wake window.

She’s truly a dream baby. When she’s hungry, she’ll whine a bit— then immediately beam the brightest smile when she sees her father or I come to pick her up. 4 month old and I’ve woken up every morning terrified it’ll end, but no. She’ll keep me up until 2 am, sure; but with giggles and joy that I’d be happy to lose sleep to behold. I love her with every fiber of my being.

All this, all this joy, all her love, all my boyfriend’s love, the gift of motherhood I was never supposed to experience— and I’m a shell.

Empty and somehow simultaneously in absolute agony.

I broke down in front of her for the first time tonight. Through all my pain, I always smile when she looks at me. It didn’t matter if I had to choke back tears with suicidal thoughts in my brain, she never ever saw me cry. I broke down and would you believe it— my saving grace smiled at me. I saw the big, goofy, gummy smile and I broke. I laid her down, fell to the ground and wailed.

My boyfriend deserves better than the mess I am, my parents deserve better, and at the tippy too of it all— my daughter deserves better.

I haven’t showered in weeks, I never leave the house, I barely eat and live on cold water and nicotine (no, I’m not breastfeeding). I want to say I don’t recognize myself, but I’ve lived a life plagued with mental illness— honestly, I feel like I recognize myself now more than ever. I’m back in that dark place I found comfort in before I met my daughter’s father. I feel like I tricked myself into false happiness with the love of my life and our child. I love them, I am happy, I should be fucking happy. I’m so blessed, but why? My daughter is perfect, healthy. I am loved, I’m cared for and I am important, why can’t I let myself feel it?

I think about death way too often nowadays, but I could never do that to my family. My boyfriend is planning to propose soon, I’m an only child and my dad just recovered from cancer. My dogs starve themselves when I’m not around. I need to be here, I want to be here, but god why can’t I get the thoughts out of my brain?

Therapy, medication, I don’t have insurance and I’m on a fucking waiting list for therapy? I want to kill myself and I’m on a waitlist. I’m so emotional and cold and distant, I know it hurts my boyfriend because he doesn’t know how to handle it. What can I say? What do I tell him when he asks how he can help? There’s nothing, I don’t even know how to help myself. How do you say “dig me out” when there’s quicksand in your throat?

What do I do when there’s nothing to do? I literally can’t bring myself to leave the house, I can’t bring myself to do anything. I’m broken.

My partner needs me, my family loves me— but I’m too deep in the quicksand to hear their muffled cries. The only thing I hear through the fog is my daughter needing me. Her tiny little noises when she needs a change or wants a cuddle.

I thought I knew darkness before, but fuck— at least I could kill myself before. I don’t have that luxury now. I grew up without a mother, how could I let my baby go through that?

My boyfriend is struggling in his own way too, I know the change took a toll on his mental health— he works a strenuous job full time so I can stay home with our daughter. He works hard, he makes me breakfast, he helps with chores. What do I give him in return? Mood swings that hit like wrecking balls and an unclean home, a mess of a woman.

God, fuck. What is happening to me? I just want to feel the joy I know is surrounding me. My hair is falling out in literal clumps and I have a stress rash that I can’t seem to get rid of. I’m a fucking disaster. ",,"forgive rambling think need vent

I think he does social smile now, at 4 months old, but I’m not sure because his smiles are usually pretty small and subtle. So maybe he isn’t smiling? It’s not the big gummy smiles I read about online that are supposed to make your heart melt. He did those before a couple times, but because they were rare I can’t be sure if those weren’t just gassy or pooping smiles. 
If he can smile but doesn’t, maybe that means he doesn’t like me or I can’t make him happy?
If he can’t smile, is there something wrong?

876,"Several months ago, I shared a lengthy post detailing my family's struggles with my wife's severe post-partum depression. In the time since, things have around the home only continued to deteriorate. After months of advocacy, I finally managed to get her to agree to attend weekly couples' counseling sessions with me. In between our second and third sessions, she hit me with the, ""I love you, but I’m not sure I still feel like I’m *in* love with you,"" and has since told me she doesn't feel like our marriage is worth saving.

She says things that are utterly detached from reality, things that baffle me in ways that are difficult to describe. She says she feels like she's left to do ""everything"" for our children on her own, but we've paid for full-time childcare (in addition to the support I provide) this whole time. She told our therapist I'm ""never there,"" but I work from home and rarely leave the house. She says she feels like she's ""on her own"" around the house, but I'm the one who does all the cooking, all the grocery shopping, most of the dishes, and most of the laundry. We probably split baths and diaper changes and the like for our kids 50/50. I also handle literally *every* administrative task for our household. When I try to remind her of these facts, she gets agitated and confrontational. I'm a doting and attentive father, and I regularly argue with her to get her *permission* to take them places with me. She's also spent significant time away (1-2 weeks at a time) from the family on multiple occasions. I have never done this.

She threatened to leave me when our first child was younger as well. I came home one day to a detailed custody plan and separation agreement just sitting on the table. So, in that sense, I've seen this before. On the other hand, though, there's something different about the exchange this time around. There's a finality that emanates throughout her words when she says it this time around, and I feel like I'm less effective at breaking through the fog the second time around. Likewise, when I try to stress to her that what she's saying isn't reflective of the lives we lead, it does not go over well at all, to say the very least.

Compounding matters, she's gone through a series of different therapists in recent months. Each one has offered a different diagnosis and, consequently, recommended a different medication. I'm sure these changes aren't helping. Moreover, whenever I express any interest in fostering her mental health, she responds with bitterness and scorn.

In truth, if it weren't for my children (3 1/2 and 1 1/2), I'd have left her a long time ago. I do my best to intervene when she's unfairly cross or contemptuous towards them, but it's clearly an unsustainable goal -- both because it weighs heavily on my own heart and because I can't always be around. 

In the past, she has punched me and shaken our older child in frustration. Each occurred only once, but I imagine that, if the shoe were on the other foot, once would be enough. When she shook our child, I was able to step in almost immediately to put a stop to it.  I know that such actions are indefensible -- PPD or no. If we separate, though, it will be an incredibly high bar to reach for me as a father to be awarded full custody of our kids, and I fear what could happen on those occasions when I'm not literally in the next room.

I have never felt more hopeless or helpless. I cry almost daily. I'm cognizant of the example we're setting for our children when it comes to how one should speak to people they love, and I fear the dysfunction that pervades our daily lives has impacted their development. Our older child is still not fully potty trained at 3 1/2, and our younger child still does not walk at 17 months.

I'm worn down. I'm not firing on all cylinders after spending years on end in full-on crisis mode. Leaving my wife would be the best thing for me as an individual, there's no question. But I genuinely fear what would/could happen to my children if I did. For that reason, pursuing divorce at this point strikes me as selfish and would make me a bad father. Still, my children deserve better than what they're getting/seeing/living on a daily basis, just as I deserve a partner capable of love and compassion and affection.

I don't know if I'm requesting advice or commiseration or reassurance from this group. Maybe I'm just hoping to unburden myself.

I made it clear before I gave birth the dog and baby don't get left alone together because neither understand boundaries and I know the dog would never deliberately hurt the baby but accidents happen.
Last week the dog accidently jumped on the baby twice on separate days and made the baby scream and cry (no major injuries to the baby). Both times the baby was being changed by me and the dog got overly excited and jumpy and I'm starting to hate the dog because of it. The owner of the dog has been there when the dog jumps on the baby and I've had multiple near misses where I can push the dog before it lands on the baby but then I feel horrible for pushing the dog.
 I still give the dogs treats and make sure the dog has their meals but it's not my dog and I no longer want to stroke or even look at it. I feel terrible because the dog is lovely and just wants attention but I just can't anymore.
It doesn't help the second time the dog jumped on the baby I grabbed the baby to check for injuries (it was more shock crying than anything only one slight scratch) and the baby was taken out of my arms so someone else could settle her like I can't be trusted to reassure and calm down my own baby.

I (30F) am on disability and not working, saving the little money I get and I take care of most of the baby care. 

When my boyfriend does have free time, he works on my old Jeep, which I didn’t ask him to, but I guess it’s nice. It’s just, I have so many things to do that I would appreciate a hand with—if he’s not going to help with chores at least take the baby and let me do it in peace. 

And here’s the thing, he’ll do it—but I either have to ask or be pushed to point of exhaustion/rage for him to help out. Why can’t he just help out without me asking?

He had a migraine the other day—I removed the baby from disturbing him, I brought him water, electrolytes, coffee and oatmeal without him asking—he slept in until 3pm. I even felt bad about how hard he works and how poorly he was feeling that I bought him some stuff from REI as a thank you gift. 

It’s just annoying that I feel like the thoughtfulness isn’t reciprocated, but I’m not sure I’m in a place to complain about it because it’s not like he doesn’t do anything or he’s a lowlife—he’s just not very thoughtful.

Well I also lost my job of 3 years, got evicted, been playing catchup with carpayments, lost another job and just keep on getting slapped in the face with lots of struggles. 

I could feel the depression, anxiety, and rage creeping in during pregnancy but tried my best to ignore it. I did pretty well keeping a smile on the outside while I was going through a lot in my mind and physically. 

Fast forward beginning of this year I gave birth to my beautiful sweet baby. My daughter had horrible colic up until around 4.5 or 5 months. It was the worse, no matter what i did she just would keep crying and crying. Sleep deprivation plus and crying baby does not mix well for an already mentally ill person. My bf was working a lot around the time (working during  holidays in retail he was pretty drained). So when I gave birth he tried his best to be present but he was so tired it didn't feel like he was as present as he could be, or maybe he was and I just needed extra help. Not even a full 2 months into being postpartum bfs mom and I had an argument and currently 7 months and counting later his whole side of the family still won't talk to us. I have a very small family so I only have my mom and dad (they're separated so it's either one or the other). 

About 3 months pp I went back to work and have been struggling to make it on time, I'm late every single day. I call in. I bs everytime I'm there. I get overwhelmed so incredibly easy. Thankfully I'm part-time and only work about 5 hour shifts a few days a week, but they're killing me. It doesn't help that I had to go to early mornings shifts. Waking up for for at 5-6am when I go to sleep at 12-2am nearly everynight is not for the weak. 

We even have lots of financial issues going on, we had our electricity turned off 2 different times this year. 

I don't mean to get into full detail about everything but I just needed you guys to understand the amount of stress's and change is just getting to me. My life has completely changed since last year and I have no idea who I am. I can't work on any hobbies of mine bc they require me to be focused and it's hard to do that with a 9 month. I'm constantly fearing of losing my job bc I can't get my shit together. I can't never keep the house in order and it's always either messy or needing something to do. I don't even do makeup anymore and I used to do it daily. I don't do anything for myself and I'm having a hard time doing things for my family. I feel so lost. 

I love my baby so much but I never imagined having a baby honestly, especially this early in life. I feel so stupid for how things turned out. I try my best to be patient but sometimes I have the worse breakdowns. Lastnight I couldn't stop crying and screaming bc I just wanted to make some food and my daughter was tired but fighting her sleep really hard. It was so tough and I was all on my own. (Bf works until like 11pm-12:30am so I'm literally all alone). 

Some days are so easy to control my emotions. I really do feel like the best mom ever and I'm so proud of myself but lately ive been in a slump and I get easily triggered by my bf, baby, cats, work, literally anything and everything. I kind of have friends but if I'm honestly speaking they're just old high-school/old work friends. I never really used to hang with them much outside of those places. My past relationship kept me from being to close to anyone so I pushed my many ppl out of my life. I don't have anyone that close to me. Sure I have some people that I know if I reached out to they could be there for me and actually understand what I'm going through but I just feel disconnected from everyone. 

I'm not sure the point of me writing this, it's just been a lot and I want to feel heard and seen. I'm sure it'll get better eventually but I don't know how much more stress I can take. I feel like a horrible mom a lot of the time. it's just ne and my bf for the most part, occasionally I have my mom's help but she's getting older and has health problems so she can't always help out as much as she's like to. 

 Disclaimer: my bf treats me really well and he always tries his best to help me feel better and take over when he's home, but I know deep down he's struggling too. Especially since his whole family are basically disowning him atp. 

Another disclaimer: I breastfeed and it takes every single ounce of everything from me. somedays I feel like I have no type of nutrients or vitamins and my minds just not fully here.

I am 7 weeks postpartum and literally feel like I’m drowning. I can’t do this anymore. I have postpartum anxiety and depression and was put on medication for it over a month ago. I thought it would get better. It’s not. 

In the beginning my husband was really helpful and supportive but lately has been treating his leave like a vacation. I’m starting to resent him for it. While he’s going out to dinner, etc with friends, going fishing/hiking, and gaming for most of the day, I’m literally living in the same 3 hour cycle. I’m doing the majority of the feedings- day and night (my baby is formula fed, not breastfed), bathing him, doing tummy time and all the interaction activities and when I’m not doing that and he is watching our baby, I am doing laundry, cleaning, cleaning/making bottles, going to the grocery store or doctors appointments. 
When he has asked me what’s wrong, I have told him time and time again that I’m drowning, I’m struggling, I’m overwhelmed. He says we are in this together and that I’m doing a great job and I’m a great mom. But we definitely are not in this together. We had to be induced 3 weeks early because of preeclampsia and hypertension, I couldn’t breastfeed, my body is going through hell and my liver is now showing signs of damage. I’m killing myself just to keep up. 
Things really boiled over when I did 2 nights of being up all day/night with the baby back to back and then I didn’t wake up to him crying on the 3rd night, my husband did. My husband gave me shit the next morning about him having to wake up TWICE to feed him and I lost it. I completely shut down. He asked me what’s wrong and I kept saying nothing so I wouldn’t snap on him. Then he got pissed at me for not telling him what’s wrong. We haven’t spoken in over a week aside from communicating about the baby. 

He has always been an incredibly loving and supportive partner, especially during my pregnancy. Now it feels like I’m barely getting through the day and he couldn’t care less. He just wants me to come to him and make it better/resolve it and talk to him but I don’t see the point in repeating the same thing over and over. Now…He has no empathy for me or the fact that I’m barely keeping it together. He won’t respond to me or offer any comfort. Nothing. 

I love my son so much. So much. I don’t regret him at all, he is the best baby. But every single day I wake up, I’m disappointed that I did. I lost my life and I just can’t do this anymore. ",,"

I feel like everything has gone downhill so fast. A lot of the time when husband's comes home I'll just pretend like everything is fine and smile and put on a fake happy face. Seems like that's the only way our relationship will last. I've given up trying to share my true feelings with him.

I had my son 3 months ago and it's been difficult from the start. I still only get 1 - 3 hours of sleep a night and because of my living situation I can't seem to get more than that. It started with me randomly having emotional breakdowns and crying hysterically. I now recognize that I have intrusive thoughts as well.. things will be fine (or not) and I randomly think of harmful things to myself or child and it scares the shit out of me. I don't feel like myself, I don't know what happened.to me. Lately I feel like things around me are not real, I describe it as I'm feeling 'delusional'.. I feel like I'm losing it. Some days I am great then suddenly I'm not. I don't feel tired, my thoughts are racing making me extremely scattered and making mistakes. I feel like my brain is on fire and I can't stop. It's almost like my eyes are blurry because I can't focus to read but I don't think it's my eyes I think it's my mind. Typing this right now I'm having a hard time rereading what I've written. 

The last few days I swear I keep seeing things. I'm not sure though. I swear I see things out of the corner of my eye and I'll recheck a million times because it's so vivid but it's not actually there. My mind is zoning out and I feel detached. I'm scared to be alone with my baby. I feel so guilty because I know for a fact that I love my baby but I don't feel it. I feel detached from him and I hate being a parent. I think he would be better without me because I'm going to ruin his life. He deserves someone who feels immense love. I can't handle him and I need constant help. I told my.bpufriend he should take our son and leave me but he won't.

897,"I, 23f, gave birth to my daughter almost 6 weeks ago now. Prior to pregnancy I was diagnosed with BPD(borderline personality disorder) and have been trying to manage that for years. It made me high risk for PPD which I have now been diagnosed with and it's not a good combination. Just for some clarification first.

Things have gotten really hard for me, especially the last few weeks. My fiance doesn't help with our daughter or with cleaning when he's home from work. He doesn't get up through the night, change her, hold her, feed her, ect. She's solely my responsibility and the house has been too(He leaves dishes, clothes, garbage everywhere) and it's made me extremely frustrated. The frustration mixed with the exhaustion and mental drain has made me very easy to lash out. I'm scared I'm going to hurt my daughter. There's been moments where she won't stop crying no matter what I do and I've been a little too rough with her, or yelling at her. I've genuinely been thinking about putting her up for adoption because I'm so scared I'll lash out at her and seriously hurt her. I know my fiance won't want to but I don't feel like I can safely do this anymore. If I had more help from him with her at the very least then maybe I could because I could sleep more and have a few moments to myself but thats not the case.

904,"Hey there-

So I believe I had post partum depression when my first was born 11 weeks ago. It lasted until 6 weeks. Then I suddenly seemed to snap out of it after spending time with a friend of mine who always seems to put things in perspective for me. 

From 6 weeks up until 2 days ago I felt good. I was in a routine with my baby. Felt I had a handle on things and was chuggin along not feeling depressed. And then last week I came down with a cold. For the first few days it was fine and I was dealing okay. I even went out with the baby to target and carried on like all was well.  When I woke up the next morning I felt so sick. I am not a person who gets sick often so I feel that I get extra frustrated when I do. 

I swear that morning I didn’t know how I was going to possibly take care of the baby by myself. Luckily my husband was able to stay home from work and help. Although I still ended up doing half the child care. 

The following day I miraculously felt better and we went out and had a fun weekend with friends. The baby even slept through the night for the first time. When I woke up Monday morning to start my day I felt right back to where I was before 6 weeks. Depressed and overwhelmed by the thought of the never ending responsibility of motherhood.   How I will never have time to myself again. How there is no me anymore.  

I think being sick is what brought back up these feelings. Similar to how I felt when I got home from the hospital after giving birth… like I needed time to recover but couldn’t bc I am a mom now. 

Something about being sick and feeling like I have to take care of baby even when I care barely take care of myself really gets to me and sends me spiraling. 

I question if this is even post partum depression or just the reality of my life setting in ?

As I rocked my baby to sleep tonight I started crying hysterical thinking about how ungrateful I felt to be the mom of such a beautiful baby. ",,"hey

905,"My MIL treated me like shit after I had my 1st baby, this without a doubt contributed to my PPA and PPD. In the first few weeks postpartum she said things like “I hope you like your new stretch marks” (which I did not get - jokes on her) and “nobody gives a shit about you guys now that the baby’s born” etc etc. She makes these horrible nasty comments and then I think she realizes how awful she sounds because shortly after she buys us a pack of diapers or does something nice.

912,"Is it post partum when you literally don’t want to be away from your baby and in the same respect want to be away from the baby for just a little bit but can’t because your baby won’t let anyone else hold him? 

I’m 9 weeks pp right now and trying not to go back to work next week and I just keep feeling like the world is going to end if I have to bring him to daycare. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and hoping she will help me get short term disability extension but in the mean time I’m panicked and feel this overwhelming feeling of dread and anger.

I had my aunts over ( my mom died when I was young I have no other support) to help me with my 3 year old while my husband is working and they even tried to hold him and he wouldn’t let them hold him for more than 5 minutes. I can’t even imagine leaving him at daycare where they have 10+ other kids to take care of while mine is just screaming for me. I can’t even fathom that, I need more time with him, he needs more time with me. 

They (my aunts) just laughed and wrote it off that he just loves me so much. All I wanted to do was cry.  I got so angry that they didn’t try a little harder and I got mad at myself for getting annoyed with my baby. 

The fact that people say that it’s hard and that everyone feels this way, yea I get it a lot of people feel this way but do they really?? How invalidating to tell someone who literally feels like the world will end next week if I have to bring him to daycare.

We can’t afford for me to stay home without getting paid, I can’t put my family in danger like that but at the same time I literally dread the feelings that will inevitably come.

With my daughter we had to bring her to daycare at 6 weeks and I cried and cried for weeks while I worked. I felt so guilty and upset and alone. Now I feel even worse going into it and I can’t even imagine how i will feel away from him.

Context: 
I have a 20 month old son that was planned with a surprise baby girl coming on the way in 6 weeks. I have fertility issues and she is our little miracle that came unexpectedly. My husband has an intense connection to his family, for most
Of our 5 year marriage someone from his family (mom, nephews, uncle and sister) has lived with us ranging from 3 to 9 month stints and they typically come with some form illness or caretaking that he has to provide. In therapy I’ve recently shared I just don’t want this for myself and I want to enjoy my little family moving forward we need to come to a better agreement. I’m okay with short visits but not having people constantly living with us like a revolving door, especially because he has 7 other siblings that don’t have small kids that can share responsibility. His sister has been living with us since feb 2024 and we aligned she’d the last

Problem
Fast forward to today. My sister in law has been here for 7 months from another country and she just does not wash her hands. She uses hand sanitizer because I strongly push for it all the time but things like when she touches the trash bin outside and comes in or wants to start washing dishes, I’ll ask her and she thinks washing her hands without soap is an ok solution. There is a cultural difference and language barrier but I feel like I’m
Tired of having this convo. My husband is zero help tbh, we had this issue with his mom who was here during my post portum journey last year who has highly unhygienic and it just drove a wedge between us because he felt I was always bringing it up

My sister in law is not like my MIL, she’s highly helpful with our son, and know she’”ll be a help with our daughter comes soon with keeping him busy but her not washing her hands with soap is giving me the worst anxiety ever and I’m Not sure if I should be pushing for her to move out or if I should be handling this another way. Ive already set a boundary that I or my husband would be the only one sterilizing the bottles and pump parts so that’s good. But I had terrible PPA with my mother in law last year staying here and was not feeling safe in my home and while I know it would never be intense like that with my SIL.

918,"Hi all, 

I started feeling not myself when my LO was about 5 months (I think, memory is a bit hazy)... 
Took me a month or 2 to look for help. Then another 3 or 4 to get off waiting lists and get help. 
My symptoms got worse as I waited. I didn't think it was PPD as I wasn't sad or experiencing psychosis. 
I was having some out of body experiences, I could sleep 16 hours a day easily and still be tired, incredible brain fog and short term/long term memory issues and a general apathy for all things in relationship, life, my child or even my own parents. 

Started SSRIs, was given a diagnosis and the apathy started to lessen and I had validation and hope which felt great. 
Started feeling a little better... bit by bit... a couple of set backs and my dose increased bit by bit. 

I got pregnant again which I was delighted about. Dose increased again a little while later. Now to 175mg... max dose 200mg. 

My biggest issue now is dissociation. I find it so hard to feel anything. My therapist reckons it's a life long struggle of growing up learning to supress. I want to be excited about my new LO. I want to experience the joy I know I can with my nearly 2 year old. I want to feel fear and love. 

I suppose I'm wondering if anyone else ever went through something similar? Is it the meds? I am making intellectual brakethroughs by the dozen in therapy- linking my fear of loss ans abandonment ans exclusion, a love so great as having a baby my body shut down all emotions so that I couldn't fear losing it if anything happened. 
If my dose lowers will I be able to feel more? Am I stuck like this forever? Did I ever have feelings?

My son was born by emergency c section which I feel traumatized me a lot, I did very much want him but was not prepared for this at all. I had my older son about 5 years ago and also dealt with PPD/A but I feel like this is so much worse. 

He is inconsolable 90% of the time unless he’s being held and then when you do hold him, you pay for it after because he screams being put down. I don’t want to wear baby-wear because I get overstimulated by having to be “attached” to him and I’ve tried swings/bouncy balls but he solely just wants to be in someone’s fucking arms 24/7 and screams for at least 20-30mins and sometimes hours. 

We’ve brought him to the paediatrician who ruled out gas/formula issues and claims he’s just a “Velcro baby” and I need to just “remain calm”. I also have the issue of family telling me I need to just give in and hold him, which makes my life harder because of the aftermath. Certain family continue to overhold him against my wishes, also making my life miserable after which is extremely frustrating. 

I feel like this stage is hell everyday and is going by so slowly. I want my life back and feel like I’ve been robbed of my own mental peace and most times feel like I don’t like my baby at all. 

I also lost my father about a month ago and can barely mourn in fucking peace because apparently my baby’s having a harder life than I am and needs to cry consistently. 

My partner is extremely helpful but also works so I try not to ask him to leave too often but, he will whenever I ask. My other son is on the ASD spectrum and is not as difficult to deal with but in finding I’m having less patience with him due to dealing with the other child. 

I just really feel as if this baby has ruined my life and I just don’t see a light at the end because this seems to just be his personality and I’m in fear for what’s to come next. Especially with overbearing and spoiling family members that will probably make the situation worse when he’s older. 

I guess I’m looking for some encouragement, it does feel good to vent but I’m just tired of feeling like this everyday because I know it’s not my true self and a lot of the circumstances are not my fault.

Posting this again :) After giving birth, I realized there was a huge gap in pp support for mothers. I went through an unplanned C-section, birth trauma, and postpartum preeclampsia, and I remember searching for a space where I could connect with other moms in real-time, but I often found forums lacking that immediate, comforting connection.

I decided to create a pp community in Discord to help bridge this gap. I am not trying to sound gimmicky. I am determined to create a safe, informative, supportive community, in real-time for pp mothers. For those unfamiliar w/ Discord, it provides real-time connection, organized spaces, and event hosting (which I plan on doing once it grows - think webinars with specialists in all different postpartum fields), among other cool capabilities. I would be honored if you would join!

932,"Sharing for the mama who feels like she is suffocating under her PPD and PPA. 

I took my first Zoloft yesterday. 

It took me 4.5 years to get here. Here as in, a place where I’ve realized I cannot holistically heal myself from my PPD any longer. 

In 2020 (S/O to the Covid mamas…), I welcomed my first child. An answered prayer. The joy of my life. Everything I ever wanted. 

I almost immediately began to spiral into what I now know was PPD and PPA. 
Every symptom you can imagine, I had/have it. Rage towards my husband, inability to make simple decisions, overwhelming anxiety, sleep deprivation, no joy, panic attacks… the whole enchilada. 

I pushed through. Despite it almost crippling my marriage entirely. 

It is by God’s providential grace my marriage is still in tact, as I almost single handily destroyed it from a place of PPD and PPA. 

I was 9 months PP with my first child when I started to take proactive steps to heal. 
Christian counseling.
Prayer. 
Bible studies.
Daily exercise. 
Adequate sleep. 
Letting my husband and parents help me with childcare so I could go out for a solo errand. 
High quality supplementation. 
Whole food diet. 

I slowly started to heal. Time helped, too. 
I healed, but I was never fully back to normal again. I just lessened the load and learned to live with it. PPD and PPA was my new baseline. 

I now have 3 beautiful children and one angel baby (miscarriage). 

4 pregnancies. 4.5 years. 

I never healed. I just carried PPD and PPA with me this entire time. I silently suffered. Although I never felt feelings of rage or disconnect towards my children, my internal dialogue was like a scene from 300 at all times. I lived in fight or flight. I hated my husband and parents for NO reason. I was not rational. 

I was a/am a high functioning depressed, anxious woman. 

Well, this week I decided I didn’t want to live like this anymore. 
“A wise woman builds her home, but a foolish woman tears it down with her own hands.” - yep, that’s me. 

Paul in Romans 7 when he says his heart and mind want to do what’s right but the flesh can’t listen? Yep, me. 

For the sake of my marriage, my household environment, family culture, and my OWN JOY…. I talked to a professional this week. 

And guess what? From carrying this for so long, I’m on the verge of entering major depression. I also have premenstrual dysphoric disorder and probably have had general anxiety disorder my whole life. 

There is no amount of kale I can eat, supplements I can take, weights I can lift, sleep I can sleep, and sunshine I can bask in that will change my messed up serotonin. 

So, yesterday, I took my first Zoloft. This is not my end. This is my beginning. This is not failure. This is actually bravery, admitting I can’t do it alone. It took me almost five years and it almost cost me everything. I’m not less of a Christian or less of a woman because I’m now prescribed an SSRI. 

I can’t heal when I’m trying to survive. I pray Zoloft will help me learn to thrive again so I can work on me more intentionally and in a less frantic way. Zoloft helps my brain so I can help my heart. That’s what I’m hoping. 

SO - if you’re reading this and you’re afraid to be honest with your doctor because you don’t want to be labeled something or you are fighting help… Pray about it. Be strong. Be courageous. And know you don’t have to hold this all together on your own. 

Much love. ❤️

936,"This is something that has bugged me for ALONG time and I am wondering if anyone else has these thoughts of if I just have some weird attachment issues. It is causing a lot of my PPD issues because I am blaming the girls for ""ruining my life"".

Backstory: I met my fiancé when I was 26 and he was 27. Before I met him I was in a relationship with a man twice my age, who was very boring so I did not do typical ""20 year old things"". I worked 2 jobs and then sat around the house when I wasn't working. My now husband on the other hand was very adventurous during that time, had/has a huge friend group who was always together, partied, took trips and just had a lot of fun.

I met my husband and finally had SO much fun. I fit right into the friend group and we were always together and having the best times. I was so happy I finally had found my best friend who I loved doing life with. The man of my dreams. Our relationship moved fast and we got engaged 10 months into our relationship and started wedding planning. We were supposed to be married this past June, however we unexpectedly ended up getting pregnant and had to push the wedding back (was due a week after our set date). We ended up going to the courthouse for insurance reasons and got married and just had our twin girls 2 months ago. He is an amazing father and even better husband, all 3 of us girls are truly blessed. It is a love I have never known and feel so lucky to have him.

That being said...even before our girls were born I really struggled with the fact that I wish I had met him sooner. I feel myself almost get angry and resentful that I did not get that pre-kid, teen, 20's time with him. I got a taste of it for 2 years and it was the best 2 years of my life. I know how much fun life could have been during that younger time with him. Him and his friend group talk about all the ""wild"" times they had together and I just wish I could have been there with him. Then we had the girls and it really felt like the nail in the coffin. Like that I am officially ""old and boring"" and even further proves that I will never have that stage of life with him. Which is silly because we still do SO much (we are blessed with a lot of support for our girls from friends and family) and I have the rest of my life with him. Like we just sat at our friends house last night for a bonfire and drinks with the girls with us and had a fun night. I just for some reason cannot shake the anger, sadness and longing for more of those younger years with him. I find myself crying on almost a daily basis  because I just long for something I will never have and don't know how to accept that. It makes me have awful thoughts about my girls, like this is somehow their fault and makes me not want them. Like stuck in the ""what if""...what would life look like if we didn't have them. Would I be happier? I tourture myself with these thoughts. Maybe this is a co-dependency/attachment issue?

943,"I (32f), started feeling ppd when baby was 7months old, think it's way easier to stick a postpartum depression diagnostic on exhausted mothers rather than face the real problem : lack of support. As woman, we are expected to mold to our environment much more than men. If we have a hard time fitting into said environment, fault is easily placed on our shoulders and we need to go to therapy, take pills, spend hundreds on self help books to try and find what we can do better. I don't know about y'all but I've been doing all those things all my life plus being clear about what I need from my environment yet it's not enough. I became a mother - I mean, if that's not a good enough reason to expect just a bit more while I adjust, I don't know what is. 

Can I just be like, exhausted of trying to be better, do better and  ask less when my environment washes their hands of wrong doing since a mental health diagnosis was plastered on? 

I don't think postpartum depression as we know it is doing us any favors. I think we are just very tired, feel unsupported and feel alone. For me, ppd right now feels invalidating to my feelings and my exhaustion and a way to make me expect less.

946,"To preface, I never intended to be a parent, I have struggled with mental health my entire life constantly in flight or flight. My husband and I have grown apart in vast measures that I didn't even realize until my one year postpartum mark. I do love my daughter deeply, I believe I can be there for her in ways I didn't know I was capable of because of my love for her. And I surprise myself daily with how well I do and how well she's growing. 

However, I'm struggling immensely with my mental health and the state of my marriage is obviously not helping at all. I feel like I'm pulling the weight of everything and my husband constantly forgets how fragile I am with my mental health. I won't go in to detail but I am constantly advocating for myself and the space for my feelings, I am always making the sacrifices and putting literally everyones well being before my own and always getting the shit end of the stick in every conversation I initiate to find solutions. It honestly feels like my husband is offended and resentful to me that I am not in love with motherhood and not making sacrifices with a big smile on my face (even though I told him before we got married I didn't want to be a parent- our pregnancy was not planned). I desperately wish for the day I can wake up and feel happiness and peace and feel rested enough without riddling myself with guilt to enjoy my daughter. 

I know I am in a bad spiral, I know that this is a rut, but I don't know how to keep myself in a neutral headspace to prevent these horrific spirals where I feel so utterly numb I don't have the energy to feel hopeful. I feel like I'm running frantically, only to be stuck in the same place. I want to enjoy life, I want to rediscover myself, fall in love with this new identity of mine and happily be present watching my daughter grow. But I am pulling and giving from an empty cup, I literally don't remember the last time I felt any sort of relief. I feel like something is wrong with me because I still feel this way despite being one year postpartum. 

My husband and I agreed to have our daughter start daycare so that we could have more time to work on our relationship and ourselves individually to be at a healthy place with ourselves and in turn be better to each other and our family. But I feel immensely guilty about it, it feels like I am placing her care with other people so that I can have some alone time.... I feel like she'll hate me if I don't spend every second with her and I already feel like a failure of a mother because I am not enjoying motherhood as society perpetuates I should be at this point. 

This is the most honest I have been in a long time. Please leave any suggestions or comments that it does get better (or worse) from your experience and anything that I should try to implement to make my life feel less like I am auto piloting everything. Also, I apologize if this didn't make sense, I am all over the place with how overwhelmed I am feeling.

947,"That is it, that is the post. I am 10 weeks postpartum with my twin girls and I just do not want to be a mom. I think about all the things motherhood is going to contain and I feel myself start to panic. Potty train, entertain toddlers, never sleep in again, miss my husband. I never wanted kids, I have never liked kids or had the desire to have one. Things happen, I felt like I would regret an abortion more, but now, all I can think about is how I regret this more. This is such a hopeless daunting feeling because this is THE REST OF MY LIFE. I feel like dying is the only way to escape these feelings. Why why why did I have to do this. I want the old me back.

948,"I don’t have any help and it’s starting to weigh on me. My baby is 2 months old. My MIL is always doing something else and I basically have to make an appointment for her to do anything helpful. My husband can’t watch the baby for 30 minutes without freaking out and needing me to take him, and I have no one on my side. I only get away from my baby and can breathe for maybe an hour every couple weeks. I feel like I’m losing myself in motherhood. My husband acts like he does a lot for the baby but he might change two diapers when he gets home. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a SAHM so I knew I’d be doing most of the childcare but he was supposed to help when he got home. Instead he’ll clean the house. I want to clean the house. I don’t want to be strapped to a baby all day and all night. I love my baby but I’m losing patience and it’s not fair to him. I’ve asked for help in so many different ways even just telling my husband “can you take him so I can nap” “how long” “maybe an hour” “too long”…. And he still wants me to feel like having sex at the end of the day. We had a big talk about how being rejected hurts him and that sex is important in a relationship. I agree that it is but so is mutual respect and sharing the mental load of things. 

He handles the mental load of moving money to each account and going to work. I have the mental load of managing a budget, taking care of a child, trying to clean the house, dealing with his mother who refuses to honor boundaries unless given to her in a very specific way or just not at all (which he “hates to ask me to put up with but that’s just how she is”). 

I do the shopping so I have to load my baby up and take him with me cause she’s never around to help. I’m the one who has to find time to do the laundry, the dishes, the counters, the floors, the bathroom, eat, take care of the baby, make bread, get groceries, bathe the child, and that’s just before he gets home. Once he’s home he wants 20 minutes to “decompress” then all he sees is what didn’t get done. 

He won’t always outright say “what did you do today” or “how did you not get anything done”. Sometimes it’ll just a a sigh or a disappointed look at the sink or couch. Like I’m doing my best! Please just say something good.

He’ll do some cleaning and get pretty much everything that I need to do done in like 3 hours (minus shopping and childcare) and then ask why it’s so hard for me to do things like…YOU DIDNT HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY WHILE DOING THAT. 

Not to mention that my baby is a Velcro baby. He HAS to have a contact nap throughout the day or he won’t sleep at night (don’t comment on that. We will have different opinions and quite frankly idc what anyone has to say about it. I’ve tried to fix that but it doesn’t work). 

Yes as of late he’s been sleeping through the night but I don’t. I get horrible nightmares now. Ever since he started only waking up once a night I’ll get nightmares or night terrors whatever you want to call them. 

We’ve had talks about all of this but the night terrors and it doesn’t change. He still feels like he does more just because sometimes he comes home and swaps laundry or washes a load of dishes. But I’m exhausted, covered in spit up, probably have shit on my hands, and haven’t eaten yet. I know I went on a rant and I’m sorry.

950,"Hey all, I’m a new dad to a beautiful baby girl who I am over the moon for. She is my world and I love her dearly. Unfortunately, my wife has been struggling hard with postpartum depression and it is really bad. All through her pregnancy she was excited to be a mother especially to a baby girl. The week we brought our daughter home she flipped. She told me she didn’t want to do this anymore and that she didn’t want her. We both knew it was PPD so we spoke to her doctor and she is now on anti depressants. 

Since being on her antidepressants, nothing has changed. She has verbally stated she wanted to un-alive herself which ended up getting her placed in a medical facility for 7 days. She was released and it didn’t help. 

 Overall, my daughter is 6 weeks old and I have been fighting to be the supportive husband that my wife and daughter both need. We have been leaning on family for support and due to how bad my wife has it we are moving to be closer to family so they can help her while I can go back to work and make money. 

This is already a long post so I did not go in to detail regarding all of my wife’s actions while dealing with her PPD. My question is, are there any fathers who went through this? How long will it last? Are we making the right decision to move closer to family? What can I do to help my wife? (I already take care of our daughter almost entirely alone. Some days my wife is feeling okay and helps but those days don’t last long). 

Also, my wife wants time away from the baby. She believes that will help her get through this. She said she wants a month away without taking care of her. I almost feel she needs that but is it smart to do? It won’t be easy on me and I’ll be leaning on family if that happened but I’m running out of options. I don’t know how to help my wife meet her needs while also making sure I can make money AND care for our daughter. What can I do?",,"hey new dad beautiful baby girl moon world love dearly unfortunately wife struggle hard postpartum depression really bad pregnancy excited mother especially baby girl week bring daughter home flip tell not want anymore not want know ppd speak doctor anti depressant

951,"I feel so bad. She has colic and was having a tough time and I just set her down and sobbed. I couldn’t do it anymore. She stopped crying while I was crying and I know she likely felt so neglected. I haven’t been sleeping because my anxiety has been so intense. She’s a great sleeper although not at the same times everyday but when she’s asleep I can’t sleep. I just worry and worry. I feel like I have to get chores around the house done and then the day rolls around and I can’t be there for her because I haven’t slept at all. My anxiety is just so bad right now. I’m on medication and I’m going to therapy. It’s just not helping. I can’t eat or sleep. I have no appetite. I could go all day without eating and not notice. My husband luckily took her before I had been crying for too long. But he got mad at me and kept saying “she’s just a baby” and “you’re not enough”. I handle all of the night feedings and diaper changes because I feel like he won’t wake up. And when I try to sleep, he bothers me almost constantly. I know he’s not trying to be unhelpful, but I am so sleep deprived. I only get maybe three hours a day. That sleep is over multiple sessions. I don’t ever get uninterrupted sleep for more than an hour. I must mention that my anxiety is super high because I have PTSD from childhood abuse. I’m terrified of not hearing her when she cries and neglecting her. I don’t ever want to subject her to what I was subjected to. I feel like me sleeping consistently will subject her to potential neglect. I just can’t take care of myself for fear of not being there for her. I’m positively exhausted.
